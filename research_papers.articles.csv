6812ea454ef6922f6d69067d,40305479,Impact of PCI strategies on outcomes of patients undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation with concomitant coronary artery disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The aim of this study is to compare the clinical benefits associated with different percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) timing strategies in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) who have coexisting coronary artery disease (CAD). A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted. PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Web of Science databases were searched for relevant articles up to April 10th, 2024. Studies that reported comparisons of clinical outcomes between PCI before/concomitant with TAVI (PCI-TAVI) vs. TAVI alone, or comparisons between PCI before/concomitant with TAVI vs. PCI after TAVI (TAVI-PCI) were selected. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality in the short-term, mid-term and long-term follow-up. A total of 23 studies pooling 15812 patients were included. Compared to TAVI alone, PCI-TAVI showed no significant difference in all-cause mortality at short- and mid-term (RRshort-term = 1.10 95%CI 0.88-1.38; RRmid-term = 1.12 95%CI 0.97-1.30), but an increase during long-term follow-up (RRlong-term = 1.20 95%CI 1.06-1.36). Compared with PCI-TAVI, TAVI-PCI is associated with lower rate of all-cause mortality at both short- and long-term follow-ups. PCI before or concomitant with TAVI may not offer clinical benefits and could potentially lead to worse outcomes in the long term. Conversely, PCI after TAVI is associated with improved clinical outcomes in both the short and long term.",Dayang Wang,Sijia Lai,Zichen Wang,Changbo Xuan,Xiaoxia Ren,Wenhua Peng,Guozhong Pan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PloS one,2025-05-01,10.1371/journal.pone.0321395,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0321395,PMC12043176,Free,20,4,e0321395,Impact of PCI strategies on outcomes of Pts undergoing TAVI with concomitant CAD A systematic review and meta analysis WANG 2025,pdfs\Impact of PCI strategies on outcomes of Pts undergoing TAVI with concomitant CAD A systematic review and meta analysis WANG 2025.pdf,PCI,Aortic Valve Implantation,TAVI,Transcatheter Aortic Valve,undergoing Transcatheter Aortic,Aortic Valve,Valve Implantation,Transcatheter Aortic,coronary artery disease,patients undergoing Transcatheter,2025-05-01,approved,true,,,,,,,,,,,

The VIVID classification has been proposed for evaluating the risk of coronary obstruction in TAVR for failed bioprosthetic surgical valves. After TAVR with the Sapien 3 valve, the feasibility of redo TAVR and coronary access decreases with a shallower implantation of the initial Sapien 3. In redo TAVR of Sapien 3 within an Evolut valve, positioning the Sapien 3 outflow at node 4 improves redo TAVR feasibility and coronary accessibility compared to positioning at nodes 5 or 6. For valve sizing in redo TAVR with Sapien 3, in-vivo CT sizing results in smaller valve sizes than bench sizing, reducing coronary risk and improving redo TAVR feasibility. Leaflet modification and coronary stenting techniques and a dedicated leaflet-splitting device have been proposed to maintain coronary perfusion in high-risk cases.\nSUMMARY: Coronary preservation in high-risk TAVR remains a significant challenge, requiring further research into preprocedural planning and leaflet modification strategies.",Takayuki Onishi,Gilbert H L Tang,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Current opinion in cardiology,2025-04-25,10.1097/HCO.0000000000001229,https://doi.org/10.1097/HCO.0000000000001229,,Paid,,,,Management of difficult coronary anatomy during TAVI what are the key issues?

6812ea494ef6922f6d690680,40301470,Risk factors and prognosis of silent cerebral infarction after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.,"The Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC)-3 definition of silent cerebral infarction among neurologic events after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) lacks clinical validation, yet its impact on postoperative in-hospital outcomes and long-term prognosis remains uncertain. This study aims to explore the perioperative related factors influencing the risk of SCI post-TAVR as defined by VARC-3 criteria, so as to identify high-risk individuals early and assess the effect of SCI on patient outcomes and one-year mortality following TAVR. This was a single-center study including 613 patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing TAVR, with all data collected prospectively in a dedicated database.We compared clinical baseline data, preoperative imaging results, perioperative factors, and intraoperative variables between patients with and without SCI according to VARC-3. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify risk factors associated with SCI. Propensity score matching (PSM) at a 1:2 ratio was employed based on fundamental characteristics such as age, gender, BMI, and medical history to minimize potential confounding. Post-matching, we analyzed differences in postoperative in-hospital outcomes and other results between the two groups. Survival times were compared using the Kaplan-Meier method, and survival curves were plotted. The log-rank test assessed statistical differences between the survival curves. Furthermore, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were conducted to determine risk factors for one-year postoperative mortality. Out of 827 TAVR patients screened, 613 were included in the final analysis-471 in the SCI group and 142 in the non-SCI group-resulting in an incidence rate of 76.8% for SCI. The occurrence of post-induction hypotension was significantly higher in the SCI group compared to the non-SCI group (70.28% vs. 61.27%, P = 0.043). Multivariate logistic regression revealed that post-induction hypotension lasting less than 10 min (odds ratio [OR]: 1.73; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.13-3.26; P = 0.009), hypotension lasting more than 10 min (OR: 1.98; 95% CI: 1.18-3.33; P = 0.01), and postoperative tachyarrhythmia (OR: 1.98; 95% CI: 1.27-3.07; P = 0.002) were significant risk factors for developing SCI after TAVR. Following 1:2 PSM, 416 patients remained-274 in the SCI group and 142 in the non-SCI group. After matching, the SCI group had a notably higher incidence of postoperative delirium compared to the non-SCI group (9.12% vs. 2.82%; P = 0.017), and their one-year mortality rate was also elevated (5.47% vs. 0.70%; P = 0.016). Additionally, multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that elevated preoperative creatinine levels (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.01; 95% CI: 1.01-1.02; P = 0.011), presence of SCI (HR: 10.81; 95% CI: 1.31-89.18; P = 0.027), Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) score greater than 7% (HR: 3.32; 95% CI: 1.07-10.33; P < 0.038), age 75 years or older (HR: 7.86; 95% CI: 1.01-14.47; P = 0.049), and a history of stroke (HR: 7.20; 95% CI: 2.32-22.35; P < 0.001) were independent risk factors for one-year mortality post-TAVR. Our findings suggest that post-induction hypotension and postoperative tachyarrhythmia are significant risk factors for SCI following TAVR as defined by VARC-3 criteria. Patients who developed SCI after TAVR exhibited higher rates of postoperative delirium and increased one-year mortality compared to those without this complication. Furthermore, factors such as elevated preoperative creatinine levels, an STS score above 7%, age of 75 years or older, and a prior history of stroke were associated with higher one-year mortality rates after TAVR. Given the negative impact of occult SCI on clinical outcomes, every effort should be made to reduce the risk of neurological complications after TAVR.",Shuguang Wu,Yi Liu,Tingting Ni,Tao Lv,Yuanyuan Yao,Min Yan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scientific reports,2025-04-29,10.1038/s41598-025-99173-8,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-99173-8,PMC8778528,Free,15,1,15006,Risk factors and prognosis of silent cerebral infarction after TAVR WU 2025,pdfs\Risk factors and prognosis of silent cerebral infarction after TAVR WU 2025.pdf,silent brain infarcts,silent brain,SCI,silent,TAVR,transcatheter aortic valve,stroke,SCI group,brain infarcts,Risk,2025-04-30,rejected,true,Clinical outcomes,Mortality,Postoperative delirium,Risk factors,Silent cerebral infarction,Transcatheter aortic valve replacement,VARC-3,,,,
6812ea494ef6922f6d690681,40298371,AI-based prediction of left bundle branch block risk post-TAVI using pre-implantation clinical parameters.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) has revolutionized the treatment of severe aortic stenosis. Although its clinical efficacy is well established, the development of new-onset left bundle branch block (LBBB) following TAVI remains a frequent and concerning complication. This study aims to develop pre-implantation predictive models for new-onset LBBB after TAVI using both conventional machine learning (ML) algorithms and Large Language Models (LLMs).\nMETHODS: Of the 1113 patients who underwent TAVI over a 15-year period, 469 were included after excluding those with preexisting LBBB, pacing rhythm, or missing relevant data. Pre-procedural clinical parameters - such as valve type, valve size, patient demographics, and comorbidities - were analyzed. The dataset was split into training and testing sets. Several ML algorithms were employed, and performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, and F1 score. Additionally, LLMs (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) were assessed using Few-Shot and Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting.\nRESULTS: New-onset persistent LBBB occurred in 15.29% of patients. Among ML models, XGBoost performed best. GPT-4 with CoT prompting demonstrated superior predictive performance compared to both conventional ML and GPT-3.5.\nCONCLUSIONS: The current study establishes a predictive model leveraging pre-implantation parameters to anticipate the occurrence of new-onset left bundle branch block (LBBB) post-Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI).\nTranscatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) is a less invasive procedure used to treat patients with severe narrowing of the aortic valve. While it has significantly improved patient outcomes, some individuals develop a new heart rhythm problem called left bundle branch block (LBBB) after the procedure. LBBB can affect the heart’s electrical system and, in some cases, lead to complications such as the need for a permanent pacemaker.This study aimed to predict which patients are most likely to develop LBBB before the TAVR procedure by using artificial intelligence (AI) models. We analyzed data from 469 patients and tested different machine learning techniques, including traditional AI models and large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4. Our results showed that XGBoost, a machine learning algorithm, was the most accurate in predicting LBBB risk, while GPT-4 performed well when prompted using a specific reasoning approach (Chain of Thought method).These findings suggest that AI models can help identify high-risk patients before the procedure, allowing doctors to make better treatment decisions. However, further studies with larger patient groups are needed to confirm the accuracy of these predictions and improve personalized care for TAVR patients.",Cheilas Vasileios,Filandrianos Giorgos,Martinos Antonios,Kostopoulou Anna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Future cardiology,2025-04-29,10.1080/14796678.2025.2498866,https://doi.org/10.1080/14796678.2025.2498866,,Paid,,,1-6,AI based prediction of LBBB risk post TAVI using pre implantation clinical parameters VASILEIOS 2025,Not available,Aortic Valve Implantation,left bundle branch,LBBB,Aortic Valve,bundle branch block,Transcatheter Aortic Valve,TAVI,bundle branch,Valve,Valve Implantation,2025-04-30,rejected,,LLMs,Transcatheter aortic valve replacement,aortic stenosis,artificial intelligence,individualized risk assessment,left bundle branch block,pre implantation predictors,,,,

This technique entails percutaneous delivery of a bioprosthetic valve. Despite the surfeit of literature on TAVR over the past fifteen years, a bibliometric analysis is conspicuously absent.\nMETHOD: A query executed on the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) on September 1, 2022, returned 8,359 articles and reviews pertinent to TAVR. Data interpretation leveraged Microsoft Excel, CiteSpace, and VOSviewer to illustrate trends and delineate focal points within the corpus of TAVR research.\nRESULT: The analysis incorporated 8,359 articles and reviews on TAVR from January 1, 2009, to August 1, 2023. Publication volume expanded from 35 in 2009 to a pinnacle in 2020, reflecting a near thirty folds increase, with citations escalating from 56 in 2009 to 27,354 in 2021. The United States prevailed in scholarly output (Np = 3,015), citation frequency (Nc = 70,991, excluding self-citations), and academic impact (H-index = 120). Columbia University was distinguished by the highest number of publications (Np = 380), citations (Nc = 41,051), and H-index (84).

Common femoral artery (CFA) access can be achieved percutaneously or through surgical cutdown, with a percutaneous approach gaining more and more popularity. The MANTA vascular closure device (VCD), a collagen plug-based device, has shown promising results in transcatheter aortic valve replacement, but data on its use in percutaneous EVAR (pEVAR), particularly in obese patients, remain limited.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective study included all patients who underwent pEVAR from October 2018 to December 2022 across three Dutch hospitals and in whom the MANTA VCD has been applied. Patient demographics, perioperative characteristics, and clinical outcomes were recorded. Subgroup analysis was performed based on body mass index (BMI), comparing outcomes in obese (BMI ≥ 30) and non-obese (BMI < 30) patients. Technical success and access site complications were primary and secondary outcomes, respectively.\nRESULTS: A total of 549 patients (mean age 75.16 ± 7.09 years, 88.9% male) were included, with 140 classified as obese. The MANTA VCD was used in 1024 CFAs. Overall technical success, defined as vascular closure with patent CFA, without requiring immediate surgery, was 98%, with a 3.1% complication rate, primarily due to closure failure. In obese patients, technical success was 98.9%, with a 1.5% complication rate, showing comparable outcomes to non-obese patients.\nCONCLUSION: The MANTA VCD is effective and safe for CFA closure in pEVAR, including in obese patients. Given rising obesity rates, the favorable outcomes in this population are encouraging and suggesting a broader applicability in large-bore percutaneous procedures.",Jacob Michiels,Maxim Peeters,Martine Uittenbogaart,Rens Oosterveld,Lucas Bloo,Maarten Loos,Lee Bouwman,Roel Janssen,Jan-Willem Elshof,Ozan Yazar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,2025-04-28,10.1007/s00270-025-04040-8,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00270-025-04040-8,PMC9790995,Free,,,,Experience with a Large Bore Vascular Closure Device in Pts Undergoing a Percutaneous Endovascular Aneurysm Repair EVAR A Multicentre Study MICHIELS 2025,pdfs\Experience with a Large Bore Vascular Closure Device in Pts Undergoing a Percutaneous Endovascular Aneurysm Repair EVAR A Multicentre Study MICHIELS 2025.pdf,Endovascular Aneurysm Repair,aortic valve,biCuspId aortic valve,transcatheter aortic valve,Percutaneous Endovascular Aneurysm,aortic valve replacement,Endovascular Aneurysm,valve,THV,coronary,2025-04-30,approved,,EVAR,Endovascular aneurysm repair,MANTA vascular closure device,Obesity,Percutaneous closure,Vascular surgery,,,,,

The purpose of this randomised controlled trial was to determine whether the addition of an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), sacubitril/valsartan, is superior to conventional medications in lowering N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels in patients undergoing TAVI for AS.\nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study design is a prospective, single-centre, open-label, randomised, parallel-group, two-arm study, in which participants will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either conventional medications plus ARNI or conventional medications only. In the ARNI group, if a patient was on an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker before TAVI, it will be switched to ARNI 100 mg/day (50 mg two times per day) on the first postoperative day. If not, candesartan 4 mg/day will be started 1-2 days before TAVI, and switched to ARNI 100 mg/day on the first postoperative day. As the patient has tolerability to ARNI, dosage will be increased stepwise to 400 mg/day 2-4 weeks apart. ARNI will be continued until at least 6-month follow-up. In the control group, the patient will receive conventional medications. The primary endpoint is the serum NT-proBNP value at 6-month follow-up after TAVI. Each group includes 42 patients (84 total patients).\nETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval for this study has been obtained from the Chiba University Hospital Certified Clinical Research Review Board (CRB3180015).

Eligible patients were aged between 75 and 85 years with low-surgical risk and isolated severe aortic stenosis. Exclusion criteria were prior heart surgery, valve-in-valve procedure, and the need for concomitant procedures. The primary end-point was mid-term all-cause mortality.\nRESULTS: 351 patients were enrolled. 243 underwent TAVI and 108 underwent AVR. Compared to AVR, TAVI patients were older (82 [78-83 ] vs 78 [77-80], p < 0.001), with higher incidence of advanced CKD (33.3% vs 15.7%, p < 0,001) and poor mobility (15.6% vs 5.6%, p = 0.008) and a higher Euroscore II (2.2 [1.72-2.98] vs 1.9 [1.31-2.46 ], p = 0.002). AVR patients had a higher incidence of post-procedural AKI (29.6% vs 4.5%, p < 0.001), while TAVI patients had a higher incidence of LBBB (23.9% vs 1.8%, p < 0.001) and at least mild to moderate PVL (4.5% vs 0%, p = 0.021). Mid- term mortality was higher among TAVI patients (HR 0.38 [95% CI 0.23-0.88], p = 0.020). In the matched cohort TAVI had a higher incidence of LBBB (11.5% vs 1.3%, p = 0.018) and permanent PM implantation (12.8% vs 5.1%, p = 0.041), while AVR patients had a higher incidence of post-procedural AKI (33.3% vs 5.1%, p < 0.001).

6812ea574ef6922f6d690686,40290187,Surgical and transcatheter aortic valve replacement align survival with general population expectations: insights from standardized mortality ratios.,"BACKGROUND: Comparative long-term survival outcomes between transcatheter (TAVR) and surgical (SAVR) aortic valve replacement remain debated. While randomized controlled trials support TAVR's non-inferiority, real-world data indicate the opposite. Comparing SAVR and TAVR patients with matched reference populations may reduce bias from direct comparisons. We compared the 5-year overall survival rates of SAVR, non-frail TAVR, and frail TAVR patients with those of matched general population standards.\nMETHODS: All patients who underwent bioprosthetic SAVR or TAVR at a tertiary hospital from 2012 to 2021 were included. Based on intervention type and Clinical Frailty Scale, patients were divided into three groups: SAVR, non-frail TAVR, and frail TAVR. Survival was compared to individual-level age- and sex-matched general population data using standardized mortality ratios (SMRs).\nRESULTS: The cohort included 939 SAVR, 328 non-frail TAVR, and 121 frail TAVR patients, with mean ages of 73.6, 85.3, and 85.6 years, and median EuroSCORE II values of 1.9%, 4.0%, and 5.2%, respectively. SAVR and non-frail TAVR patients had survival rates comparable to those of the reference population [SMR = 0.93 [0.76-1.14]; p = 0.437 and SMR = 0.94 [0.76-1.15]; p = 0.468]. Conversely, frail TAVR patients faced a 40% increased mortality risk compared with their reference population [SMR = 1.40 (1.04-1.88); p = 0.012].\nCONCLUSIONS: In non-frail patients, TAVR and SAVR both restore life expectancy to general population standards.

6812ea5a4ef6922f6d690688,40289515,Vascular Closure Devices for Large Bore Femoral Access After Transfemoral Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: A Network Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Large-bore femoral access is commonly required in transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TF-TAVR), but vascular access complications remain prevalent, impacting patient outcomes. Various vascular closure devices (VCDs) are used for hemostasis, including the suture-based Prostar XL, Perclose ProGlide, and ProStyle, and the plug-based MANTA device. However, comprehensive comparative evidence on these VCDs, particularly single Perclose strategies, is lacking.\nMETHODS: A systematic review and network meta-analysis were conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. We included randomized and observational studies comparing the safety and efficacy of VCDs for large-bore femoral access closure in TF-TAVR patients. Primary outcomes included major vascular complications; secondary outcomes included major and minor bleeding, minor vascular complications, VCD failure, and all-cause mortality. Frequentist and Bayesian analyses were performed using a random-effects model, with additional subgroup analyses of single Perclose strategies.\nRESULTS: Thirty-five studies comprising 16,503 patients met inclusion criteria. The single Perclose strategy, with or without adjunct Angio-Seal or FemoSeal, significantly reduced major vascular complications compared to dual Perclose (RR: 1.9, 95% CI [1.2-3.01]), MANTA (RR: 1.89, 95% CI [1.03-3.48]), and Prostar XL (RR: 3.46, 95% CI [1.94-6.18]). Among secondary outcomes, single Perclose also ranked highest in reducing minor complications and bleeding.\nCONCLUSION: Single Perclose strategies, especially when combined with Angio-Seal, demonstrated superior safety and efficacy for large-bore femoral access closure following TF-TAVR. These findings support the need for further randomized trials to validate single Perclose as a primary approach in TF-TAVR vascular closure.",Sunil Upadhaya,Alina Upreti,Kunal Gupta,Bella Gonzalez-Perez,Radia Ksayer,Pedro Cox-Alomar,Cristina Sanina,Anand Irimpen,Serdar Farhan,Jose Wiley,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,2025-04-27,10.1002/ccd.31565,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.31565,,Paid,,,,Vascular Closure Devices for Large Bore Femoral Access After TF TAVR A Network Meta Analysis UPADHAYA 2025,Not available,Large Bore Femoral,Aortic Valve Replacement,Transcatheter Aortic Valve,Transfemoral Transcatheter Aortic,Large Bore,Bore Femoral Access,Valve Replacement,Transcatheter Aortic,Aortic Valve,Transfemoral Transcatheter,2025-04-30,approved,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, comparative data on self-expanding valves (SEV) versus balloon-expanding valves (BEV) remain limited.\nMETHODS: A comprehensive review of PubMed and Embase was conducted through April 2024, identifying eight studies (five randomized controlled trials and three propensity-matched observational studies) comparing SEV and BEV in TAVR. Primary outcomes included all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and device success per Valve Academic Research Consortium criteria, while secondary outcomes assessed bioprosthetic valve dysfunction and adverse events (annulus rupture/dissection, coronary artery occlusion, valve dislocation/embolization, valve thrombosis, moderate and severe paravalvular aortic regurgitation, endocarditis, permanent pacemaker implantation, major or life-threatening bleeding, acute kidney injury, and stroke).\nRESULTS: The analysis included 4,032 patients (SEV = 2,006; BEV = 2,017). SEV was associated with higher rates of moderate-to-severe paravalvular aortic regurgitation [OR, 1.76; CI 1.13-2.74; P = 0.01] and permanent pacemaker placement [OR, 1.57; CI, 1.23-2.00; P = 0.0002] compared to BEV. No significant differences were observed in 30-day or 1-year all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, device success, bioprosthetic valve dysfunction, valve dislocation/embolization, valve thrombosis, endocarditis, major or life-threatening bleeding, coronary artery occlusion, stroke, rehospitalization, or acute kidney injury.\nCONCLUSION: SEV and BEV demonstrated comparable outcomes in mortality and device success. However, the higher risk of moderate-to-severe paravalvular aortic regurgitation and permanent pacemaker placement with SEV should be considered when selecting the optimal TAVR valve for individual patients.",Montaser Elkholy,Mohammad Akkawi,George G Kidess,Zaid Abdulelah,Abdallah Rayyan,Mohammad Riyad Al-Dqour,Ahmad Damlakhy,Yasemin Bahar,M Chadi Alraies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The American journal of the medical sciences,2025-04-25,10.1016/j.amjms.2025.04.010,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjms.2025.04.010,,Paid,,,,Comparative Effectiveness and Safety of Self Expanding Versus Balloon Expandable TAVR A Systematic Review and Meta Analysis ELKHOLY 2025,Not available,Effectiveness and Safety,Aortic Valve Replacement,Transcatheter Aortic Valve,Versus Balloon-Expandable Transcatheter,Balloon-Expandable Transcatheter Aortic,Valve Replacement,Transcatheter Aortic,Systematic Review,Comparative Effectiveness,Valve,2025-04-30,rejected,,Self-expanding valves,balloon-expanding valves,effectiveness,safety,,,,,,,

Particularly, scarce data exist comparing the results of TAVR with new-generation devices versus early-generation devices in these patients. This study evaluated the temporal trends in TAVR practices among LFLG-AS patients.\nMETHODS: This multicenter registry included 424 consecutive LFLG-AS patients undergoing TAVR between 2007 and 2023, stratified by device generation: new-generation devices(n=193) and early-generation devices(n=231). All-cause mortality or heart failure hospitalization (HFH) at 1-year follow-up was the primary endpoint.\nRESULTS: The median Society of Thoracic Surgeons score was lower in the new-generation group (5.3 [3.4-8.2]% vs 7.4 [5.0-12.1]%; p<0.001), while left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was similar (new:31.2 ± 8.3%, early:30.0 ± 8.8%; p=0.16). New-generation devices were associated with a significant reduction in moderate-to-severe paravalvular leak post-TAVR (2.6% vs. 9.1%; p=0.005) but 30-day mortality was similar (new:1.6%, early:3.9%; p=0.15). At 1-year, new-generation devices were associated with a greater LVEF improvement (43.8 ±12.5% vs. 39.8 ±11.5%; p=0.003), but without a significant reduction in all-cause mortality or HFH (new:23.8% vs. early:28.1%; p=0.32). Chronic kidney disease and low hemoglobin independently predicted worse outcomes (p<0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: Despite procedural improvements with new-generation TAVR devices, clinical outcomes in LFLG-AS patients remain suboptimal. LVEF significantly improved following TAVR with new-generation devices but failed to translate into improved clinical outcomes. These findings suggest that TAVR alone may not suffice in this population and underscore the need for a comprehensive therapeutic approach that integrates TAVR with optimized medical management and cardiac rehabilitation.",Siddhartha Mengi,Luis Nombela-Franco,Pedro Cepas-Guillén,Stamatios Lerakis,Raj Makkar,Tarun Chakravarty,Vassilis Babaliaros,Henrique Barbosa Ribeiro,Emilie Pelletier-Beaumont,Philippe Pibarot,Josep Rodés-Cabau,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The Canadian journal of cardiology,2025-04-24,10.1016/j.cjca.2025.04.015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2025.04.015,,Paid,,,,Temporal Trends in TAVR Outcomes in Pts With Low Flow Low Gradient AS Insights From The TOPAS TAVI Registry MENGI 2025,Not available,Transcatheter Aortic Valve,Aortic Valve Replacement,Low-Gradient Aortic Stenosis,Transcatheter Aortic,Aortic Stenosis,Aortic Valve,Valve Replacement,Low-Gradient Aortic,Valve Replacement Outcomes,TAVI Registry,2025-04-30,rejected,,,,,,,,,,,,

The analysis compared single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT), dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), direct oral anticoagulants, and oral anticoagulant (OAC) plus SAPT. A frequentist network meta-analysis was employed to evaluate the post-TAVR risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, total bleeding, and life-threatening or major bleeding.\nRESULTS: Eleven studies (8 randomized controlled trials and 3 propensity score-matched cohorts) comprising 5,821 patients undergoing TAVR were included. SAPT significantly reduced the risk of life-threatening/major bleeding compared with DAPT (OR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.35-0.80), OAC (OR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.28-0.99), and OAC + SAPT (OR: 0.32; 95% CI: 0.13-0.76). No significant differences were observed in the risk of cardiovascular mortality, stroke, or myocardial infarction between antithrombotic regimens. Subgroup analysis indicated an increased risk of mortality with low-dose rivaroxaban+3-month SAPT compared with SAPT (OR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.35-0.89) and DAPT (OR: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.38-0.88).

6812ea5e4ef6922f6d69068c,40283668,Review Article: Contemporary Transcatheter Heart Valves for TAVI in Bicuspid Aortic Anatomy.,"Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most common congenital heart disease, affecting 0.5-2% of the population and often leading to early aortic valve degeneration. While surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) remains the gold standard for treating severe bicuspid aortic stenosis (AS), transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is emerging as a viable alternative in selected BAV anatomies. Initial experiences with first-generation transcatheter heart valves (THVs) showed the feasibility of this technique, but were associated with lower device success rates and higher complications, such as paravalvular leak (PVL) and pacemaker implantation. Advancements in second- and third- generation THVs, together with better pre-procedural imaging assessment and growing operator experience, have significantly enhanced TAVI outcomes in BAV patients, with results now comparable to those seen in tricuspid aortic valves (TAVs). Proper patient selection, pre-procedural sizing, and device implantation are key to improving TAVI success in BAV. Recent registry data on contemporary THV platforms demonstrate improved procedural success, hemodynamic performance, and the safety of TAVI in BAV. However, higher rates of PVL, pacemaker implantation, and strokes remain concerns. Ongoing advancements in THV design and procedural techniques will further enhance outcomes for this challenging population. Up to the present, there are no dedicated THVs for BAV, but the latest-generation THVs offer promising results.",Chrysavgi Simopoulou,Omar Oliva,Vincenzo Cesario,Nicolas Dumonteil,Didier Tchetche,Chiara De Biase,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal of clinical medicine,2025-04-20,10.3390/jcm14082838,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm14082838,PMC12027816,Free,14,8,,Review Article Contemporary Transcatheter Heart Valves for TAVI in Bicuspid Aortic Anatomy SIMOPOULOU 2025,pdfs\Review Article Contemporary Transcatheter Heart Valves for TAVI in Bicuspid Aortic Anatomy SIMOPOULOU 2025.pdf,aortic valve,BAV,TAVI,Bicuspid aortic valve,Transcatheter Heart Valves,Bicuspid Aortic,Aortic,transcatheter aortic valve,aortic valve implantation,valve,2025-04-30,approved,,balloon-expandable valve (BEV),bicuspid aortic valve (BAV),paravalvular leak (PVL),permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI),self-expanding valve (SEV),transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI),,,,,

This case report highlights the diagnostic and therapeutic approach for a 72-year-old woman presenting with exertional chest pain, dyspnea, fatigue, and a history of melena. Methods: The diagnostic workup revealed severe microcytic anemia and a reduced vWF ristocetin-to-antigen ratio. Imaging confirmed severe degenerative aortic stenosis, while video capsule endoscopy identified angiodysplasia and telangiectasias in the small bowel as the source of gastrointestinal bleeding. Following evaluation by a multidisciplinary Heart Team, the patient underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with an Evolut Fx self-expanding prosthesis. Results: Post-procedural echocardiography showed mild paravalvular regurgitation. The patient's clinical course was favorable, with resolution of anemia and no further gastrointestinal bleeding episodes. Conclusions: Heyde syndrome requires a high index of suspicion for diagnosis in patients with severe aortic stenosis and unexplained anemia or gastrointestinal bleeding. TAVR offers an effective treatment option that not only resolves valvular pathology, but also mitigates associated bleeding risks.",Claudiu Florin Rășinar,Alexandru Tîrziu,Rebeca Ionela Rășinar,Florin Gîru,Cristian Mornoș,Dan Gaiță,Constantin Tudor Luca,Daniel Miron Brie,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal of clinical medicine,2025-04-19,10.3390/jcm14082819,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm14082819,PMC12027620,Free,14,8,,TAVR Reverses Heyde Syndrome A Case Report of sAS and Gastrointestinal Bleeding RĂȘINAR 2025,pdfs\TAVR Reverses Heyde Syndrome A Case Report of sAS and Gastrointestinal Bleeding RINAR 2025.pdf,Severe Aortic Stenosis,Aortic Stenosis,Aortic Valve Replacement,Transcatheter Aortic Valve,Gastrointestinal Bleeding,Aortic Valve,Aortic,Heyde Syndrome,Severe Aortic,Replacement Reverses Heyde,2025-04-30,approved,,Heyde syndrome,acquired von Willebrand syndrome,angiodysplasia,aortic stenosis,gastrointestinal bleeding,transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR),video capsule endoscopy (VCE),von Willebrand factor (vWF),,,

When compared with TAVR, redo-TAVR is a rare and novel procedure. Current clinical data derived from registries suggest excellent safety, with low rates of 30-day and 1-year mortality following redo-TAVR. Proper understanding of data from bench studies regarding optimal valve configurations, of patient anatomy and of the technical properties of transcatheter heart valves (THV) is essential for patient selection and procedural success. Lifetime management of redo-TAVR should start before the index procedure, as the choice of the index THV has a major impact on the feasibility of redo-TAVR.

6812ea654ef6922f6d69068f,40283481,A Tale of Two Diseases: Decoding Aortic Stenosis and Cardiac Amyloidosis.,"Background/Objectives: Transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR-CA) is an infiltrative cardiomyopathy caused by transthyretin (TTR) amyloid deposition in the myocardium, increasingly recognized in patients with aortic stenosis (AS). This study aims to investigate the diagnostic challenges and therapeutic strategies for patients with both conditions, focusing on shared pathophysiological mechanisms and key diagnostic indicators. Methods: A multimodal diagnostic approach was applied, utilizing cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) and bone scintigraphy with technetium-99m-labeled tracers to assess AS patients with suspected ATTR-CA. Clinical signs, such as disproportionate heart failure symptoms, conduction abnormalities, and low-flow, low-gradient AS, were evaluated. Electrocardiographic findings, including low-voltage QRS complexes and pseudo-infarction patterns, were also assessed. Treatment options, including transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and emerging pharmacotherapies for ATTR-CA, were analyzed. Results: The study found that ATTR-CA is increasingly prevalent in AS patients, with shared mechanisms like oxidative stress and amyloid-induced tissue remodeling. Key diagnostic signs include disproportionate heart failure symptoms, conduction abnormalities, and specific electrocardiographic patterns. TAVR was effective in both isolated AS and AS with ATTR-CA, although patients with both conditions had a higher risk of heart failure hospitalization and persistent symptoms. Emerging pharmacotherapies, such as TTR stabilizers and gene-silencing agents, showed promise in slowing disease progression. Conclusions: A multimodal diagnostic approach is essential for the early detection of ATTR-CA in AS patients. Combining TAVR with emerging pharmacotherapies may improve long-term outcomes for this high-risk group, enhancing patient care in those with both conditions.",Ioannis Gialamas,George E Zakynthinos,George Dimeas,Panteleimon Pantelidis,Elias Gialafos,Styliani Brili,Athina Goliopoulou,Ourania Katsarou,Elsi Tryfou,Konstantinos Kalogeras,Gerasimos Siasos,Evangelos Oikonomou,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal of clinical medicine,2025-04-12,10.3390/jcm14082652,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm14082652,PMC12027563,Free,14,8,,A Tale of Two Diseases Decoding AS and Cardiac Amyloidosis GIALAMAS 2025,pdfs\A Tale of Two Diseases Decoding AS and Cardiac Amyloidosis GIALAMAS 2025.pdf,Aortic Stenosis,patients,Decoding Aortic Stenosis,ATTR-CA,Aortic,Cardiac Amyloidosis,Stenosis,TAVR,Amyloidosis,Cardiac,2025-04-30,rejected,,AS,ATTR,aortic stenosis,cardiac amyloidosis,cardiomyopathy,hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis,low-flow,low-gradient aortic stenosis,transthyretin,transthyretin amyloidosis,wild-type transthyretin amyloidosis

The progression of moderate MR remains undetermined, given uncertain clinical significance and natural history. This study aims to assess the evolution of moderate MR following TAVI. Materials and Methods: Between 2018 and 2023, 1476 patients underwent TAVI. We excluded those with previous aortic or mitral valve interventions, endocarditis, concomitant percutaneous coronary intervention, or emergent procedures. Patients with severe aortic or tricuspid regurgitation or significant mitral stenosis were excluded. Ultimately, only patients with moderate MR were included, resulting in a final population of 154 patients. Results: Mean age was 81.4 ± 7.8 years, 48.1% (74/154) were female, and 48.1% (74/154) were functional MR. There was one surgical conversion due to annular rupture. Thirty-day mortality was 1.9% (3/154). Postoperative echocardiography showed 38 (24.7%) patients with none/trace MR, 91 (59.1%) with mild MR, 22 (14.3%) with moderate MR, and 3 (1.9%) with severe MR. Finally, according to the echocardiographic follow-up [median follow-up 1.0 (IQR: 0.1-1.2) years], 20.1% (31/154) had no/trace MR, 39.6% (61/154) had mild MR, 35.7% (55/154) had moderate MR, and 4.5% (7/154) had severe MR. Overall, 67 (43.5%) patients had any MR grade progression, 62 (40.3%) had stable disease, and 25 (16.2%) had any MR grade reduction at the last follow-up from the operation. No difference in MR evolution was seen between functional and primary MR. Conclusions: Concomitant moderate MR during TAVI has a variable evolution over time.

6812ea694ef6922f6d690691,40282952,Hemodynamic Performance of a Self-Expanding Transcatheter Aortic Valve with an Intra-Annular Leaflet Position in Patients with a Small Aortic Annulus.,"Background and Objectives: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation is associated with a higher risk for elevated trans-prosthetic gradients and prosthesis-patient mismatch in patients with a small aortic annulus. We aimed to assess the short-term hemodynamic performance of self-expanding transcatheter aortic valves with an intra-annular leaflet position in patients with small aortic anatomies. Materials and Methods: Consecutive patients with small aortic annuli (annular area < 430 mm2), who underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation with a self-expanding Portico or Navitor (Abbott Medical, St. Paul, MN, USA) transcatheter aortic valve between October 2017 and August 2024 at the University Medical Centre Ljubljana, Slovenia, were analyzed. The main endpoints were the post-procedural mean trans-prosthetic gradient, the presence of moderate or severe prosthesis-patient mismatch or paravalvular regurgitation. Results: Overall, 37 patients were included in the study (29 patients with a native aortic valve and 8 patients undergoing valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve implantation). The mean age was 81.6 ± 4.3 years, 32 patients (86.5%) were female. The median annular perimeter was 70.8 mm (interquartile range 67.3-74.1 mm) and the median annular area was 379 mm2 (interquartile range 355-412 mm2). The post-procedural mean trans-prosthetic gradient was 9.0 ± 3.5 mmHg, with no cases with a mean gradient > 20 mmHg.

6812ea6b4ef6922f6d690692,40282939,Cardiac Rehabilitation in TAVI Patients: Safety and Benefits: A Narrative Review.,"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has redefined the management of severe aortic stenosis, particularly in surgical high-risk patients. As the number of TAVI procedures increases, there is a growing need for effective post-procedural care. Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) has emerged as a critical component of treatment in these patients. The most recent update of the European recommendations highlights the importance of including post-TAVI patients in CR programs. However, the benefits of CR in this particular patient group still need to be fully understood. The objective of this narrative review is to summarize the safety and benefits of post-TAVI CR by evaluating its impact on functional capacity, frailty, muscular strength, mental health, quality of life, and long-term survival. While emerging evidence supports its safety and effectiveness in the aforementioned outcomes, gaps remain regarding the optimal rehabilitation protocols, including the timing, duration, and intensity of CR as well as its long-term cardiovascular benefits. Further research is needed to develop personalized approaches for different patient groups. This article highlights the current knowledge, identifies critical gaps, and underlines the need for tailored rehabilitation strategies to improve post-TAVI recovery and patient outcomes.",Theodor Constantin Stamate,Cristina Andreea Adam,Radu Sebastian Gavril,Radu Ștefan Miftode,Andreea Rotundu,Ovidiu Mitu,Doina Clementina Cojocaru,Grigore Tinică,Florin Mitu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2025-04-01,10.3390/medicina61040648,https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina61040648,PMC12028665,Free,61,4,,Cardiac Rehabilitation in TAVI Pts Safety and Benefits A Narrative Review STAMATE 2025,pdfs\Cardiac Rehabilitation in TAVI Pts Safety and Benefits A Narrative Review STAMATE 2025.pdf,Transcatheter aortic valve,aortic valve implantation,aortic valve,Cardiac Rehabilitation,TAVI Patients,TAVI,aortic,Patients,Rehabilitation,Transcatheter aortic,2025-04-30,,,aortic stenosis,cardiac rehabilitation,exercise training,frailty,transcatheter aortic valve implantation,,,,,,

However, the optimal antithrombotic strategy tailored to individual patient profiles remains unclear. This study aims to evaluate the outcomes of personalized antithrombotic regimens in patients with AF after TAVR. Methods: We enrolled 121 AF patients who underwent TAVR from 2009 to 2023. Patients were grouped into seven groups based on individualized post-procedural antithrombotic regimens. The regimens included the following: single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) + direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) (n = 44, 36.3%); DOACs only (n = 25, 20.6%), SAPT + warfarin (n = 17, 14%); dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) (n = 13, 10.7%); warfarin only (n = 8, 6.6%); DAPT + warfarin (n = 7, 5.8%); and DAPT + DOACs (n = 7, 5.8%). The study outcomes included incidences of strokes or transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), major bleeding, and survival. Results: The median follow-up was 27 months. The incidence of stroke, TIA, or major bleeding was similar among the seven treatment groups. However, a trend toward a higher rate of stroke was observed in the triple regimen containing warfarin (28.6%); also, the highest rate of major bleeding was observed in the warfarin-only group (25%). Survival for patients discharged and placed under various antithrombotic regimens did not differ significantly despite some numerical variations being present across the groups, with the lowest mortality reported with SAPT + warfarin (7%) and the highest with DAPT + warfarin (57%). Conclusions: This study highlights the outcomes related to stroke, major bleeding, and mortality across personalized antithrombotic regimens in patients with AF after TAVR. While no statistically significant differences were observed, findings emphasize the need for further large-scale studies to define optimal personalized antithrombotic strategies based on individual patient characteristics.",Razan Awan,Monirah A Albabtain,Aisha AlRasheedi,Maha AlHarthi,Zaid Alanazi,Amr A Arafat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal of personalized medicine,2025-04-09,10.3390/jpm15040149,https://doi.org/10.3390/jpm15040149,PMC12029002,Free,15,4,,Personalized Antithrombotic Strategies in Pts with AFib Following TAVR AWAN 2025,pdfs\Personalized Antithrombotic Strategies in Pts with AFib Following TAVR AWAN 2025.pdf,Transcatheter Aortic Valve,Patients,Aortic Valve Replacement,antithrombotic regimens,Saudi Arabia,Antithrombotic,Aortic Valve,Personalized Antithrombotic Strategies,Personalized Antithrombotic,TAVR,2025-04-30,rejected,,anticoagulants,antiplatelet,bleeding,direct oral anticoagulants,stroke,transcatheter aortic valve replacement,,,,,

This study aimed to analyze clinical outcomes of TAVR explantation stratified by the original risk profile at the time of TAVR.\nMETHODS: We reviewed our single institutional series of 110 consecutive patients who underwent TAVR explant between 2013 and 2024. This cohort was stratified into low-risk (n=35), intermediate-risk (n=35), and high/extreme-risk (n=40) categories based on the original risk profile.\nRESULTS: Low-risk patients began to appear in 2018. By 2021, the number of low/intermediate-risk patients surpassed that of the high/extreme-risk group. Balloon-expandable valves were predominantly used in the low-risk group, whereas chronic kidney disease was more prevalent in the other groups. The majority of patients in each group had either structural valve deterioration (SVD) and/or non-SVD as the primary failure mechanism, with endocarditis accounting for 20% or less. Cardiopulmonary bypass/aortic cross-clamp times were longest in the high-/extreme-risk group. Overall, 75 (68.2%) patients underwent a concomitant procedure during TAVR explant, most commonly an aortic (n=39; 52.0%) and a mitral procedure (n=29; 38.7%). The high/extreme-risk group had the highest rates of concomitant procedures. Operative mortality improved significantly over time, dropping from 27.3% in Era 1 (2013-2017) to 5.6% in Era 3 (2022-2024) (P=0.049). The operative and one-year mortality rates were 8.6%, 8.6%, and 7.5% (P=0.98), and 17.1%, 8.6%, and 17.5% (P=0.48) in the low-, intermediate-, and high-/extreme-risk group, respectively. Conversely, the observed-to-expected mortality ratio (O/E ratio) was highest in the low-risk group (2.8 vs. 1.0 vs. 0.8; P<0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: Low-risk patients are emerging as the predominant group requiring TAVR explant. Despite the procedural simplicity and lower-risk profile, the operative mortality was comparable to higher-risk groups, and the O/E ratio was significantly higher in the low-risk group.

6812ea744ef6922f6d690696,40270857,How to avoid transcatheter aortic valve replacement explant as the second valve procedure: image assessment for the index transcatheter aortic valve replacement.,"The management of severe aortic stenosis (AS) has evolved significantly, with a shift toward shared decision-making regarding the choice of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) or surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). This shift necessitates careful consideration of long-term valve durability, as both TAVR and SAVR with bioprosthetic valves offer limited durability, potentially requiring reoperation later in life. While mechanical valves and the Ross procedure offer lifelong durability, patient preferences, including avoidance of anticoagulation, often dominate the discussion. This manuscript reviews the complex decision-making process in selecting the most appropriate valve for the first intervention, focusing on balancing the immediate benefits of a less invasive procedure with the long-term risks and the potential need for a second valve intervention. In the TAVR era, younger patients elect the least invasive treatment option with the shortest recovery. Age, anticoagulation tolerance, comorbidities, and aortic root anatomy influence valve choice, with particular attention to prosthesis-patient mismatch (PPM). Here, we emphasize that careful preoperative planning is essential to minimize PPM and optimize hemodynamics for the first valve, considering the possibility of future valve interventions. Furthermore, advanced imaging and simulation tools, such as computed tomography (CT) and artificial intelligence-based platforms, are now being utilized to predict the feasibility of redo interventions and guide the selection of the initial valve. The increasing prevalence of redo-TAVR and TAVR explantation underscores the importance of planning for a second valve at the time of the initial intervention. Simulation techniques can predict the anatomical feasibility of redo-TAVR, providing a safer framework for managing patients requiring subsequent valve replacements. Ultimately, heart teams must equip themselves with the tools and expertise necessary to ensure the durability of the first valve and readiness for future interventions, thereby improving patient outcomes over their lifetimes.",Kendra J Grubb,Hiroki A Ueyama,Stephanie K Tom,R Michael Reul,Alexander P Nissen,Andy Tully,Anton Camaj,John Lisko,Joe Xie,Elizabeth L Norton,Kanika Kalra,Patrick T Gleason,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Annals of cardiothoracic surgery,2025-03-31,10.21037/acs-2024-etavr-0190,https://doi.org/10.21037/acs-2024-etavr-0190,PMC12013759,Free,14,2,112-121,How to avoid TAVR explant as the second valve procedure image assessment for the index TAVR GRUBB 2025,pdfs\How to avoid TAVR explant as the second valve procedure image assessment for the index TAVR GRUBB 2025.pdf,aortic valve replacement,valve,aortic valve,transcatheter aortic valve,valve replacement,surgical aortic valve,TAVR,aortic,Emory University School,transcatheter aortic,2025-04-30,,,Aortic stenosis (AS),aortic valve replacement (AVR),prosthesis-patient mismatch (PPM),redo-TAVR,surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR),transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR),,,,,

This study assesses TAVR explant outcomes at a high-volume Japanese center.\nMETHODS: From October 2009 to December 2023, 10 TAVR explants were performed after 1,364 TAVR procedures at a leading Japanese high-volume center, and clinical outcomes were retrospectively analyzed. Data were drawn from a prospectively maintained database, assessing preoperative and intraoperative variables, as well as short- and long-term postoperative outcomes.\nRESULTS: Thirty-nine BVFs were observed during follow-up, and 16 (41.0%) redo-TAVRs were performed in the same timeframe. In the 10 (25.6%) TAVR explant cases, the median age of the patients was 79.5 years, with a predicted mortality for isolated surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) by Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) score of 4.5%. The primary indications for TAVR explant were PVE (40.0%) and structural valve deterioration (SVD) (30.0%). Concomitant procedures were necessary in 90% of cases, including aortic repair (40.0%) and mitral replacement or repair (30.0%). Aortic annulus reinforcement using autologous pericardium was performed in 30% of cases. The 30-day mortality rate was 20%, with 20% of cases requiring temporary mechanical circulatory support and postoperative continuous hemodiafiltration. In mid-term outcomes, the survival rate was 60% in 1 year and 40% in 3 years, respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: In this Japanese high-volume center experience, TAVR explants predominantly involved elderly patients and frequently required a concomitant procedure. The outcome was generally poor, comparable to those in Western countries. As the number of TAVR explants is expected to increase in Japan, knowledge-sharing within heart teams, including cardiac surgeons, is essential.",Kazuo Shimamura,Ai Kawamura,Daisuke Yoshioka,Yusuke Misumi,Koichi Maeda,Kizuku Yamashita,Takuji Kawamura,Shigeru Miyagawa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Annals of cardiothoracic surgery,2025-03-31,10.21037/acs-2024-etavr-0167,https://doi.org/10.21037/acs-2024-etavr-0167,PMC12013763,Free,14,2,131-140,TAVR explantation experience in Japanese high volume center SHIMAMURA 2025,pdfs\TAVR explantation experience in Japanese high volume center SHIMAMURA 2025.pdf,TAVR explant,TAVR,TAVR explant outcomes,aortic valve replacement,Japanese high-volume center,TAVR explant cases,explant,aortic valve,valve,valve replacement,2025-04-30,,,Japan,Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR),explant,,,,,,,,

6812ea7d4ef6922f6d69069a,40270852,Surgical management is associated with improved survival for endocarditis after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.,"BACKGROUND: Prosthetic valve endocarditis is a rare yet devastating complication following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). This study aims to investigate the outcomes of surgical versus medical management of post-TAVR endocarditis.\nMETHODS: Between 2011 and 2024, 67 patients with post-TAVR endocarditis were identified, comprising 24 (35.8%) patients managed surgically and 43 (64.2%) managed medically. All cases were reviewed by our multidisciplinary endocarditis team to determine the optimal treatment strategy.\nRESULTS: The overall incidence of post-TAVR endocarditis was 1.4%. The number of endocarditis cases increased over time from 1-2 in 2015-2018 to 18 in 2023. The most frequent source of endocarditis was unknown (32.8%), and the predominant causative organism was enterococcus species (25.4%). Notably, among the 43 medically managed patients, 19 (44.2%) exhibited surgical indications, predominantly due to large vegetations with or without embolic complications (n=11; 57.9%). The medical management group had a higher proportion of females and more frequent use of self-expandable valves compared to the surgical group. The time interval between TAVR and endocarditis diagnosis was similar across both groups. In the surgically managed cohort, isolated aortic valve replacement was uncommon, with most patients undergoing complex TAVR explantations coupled with concomitant procedures, most frequently aortic root repair (n=11; 45.8%). The 30-day and 1-year mortality rates for the three groups (surgical, medical without surgical indications, and medical with surgical indications) were 0%, 4.2%, and 31.6% (P=0.002), and 4.2%, 20.8%, and 73.7% (P<0.001), respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: Surgical management was associated with significantly improved survival compared to medical management for post-TAVR endocarditis. The poor clinical outcomes in the medically managed group were primarily due to patients who did not undergo surgery despite having surgical indications.

6812ea824ef6922f6d69069b,40270851,Transcatheter aortic valve replacement explant various techniques.,"Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) has long been the gold standard for treating significant aortic valve dysfunction. Since the introduction of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in 2011, the number of TAVRs has grown rapidly, surpassing SAVR volumes by 2018 and now accounting for approximately 80% of all aortic valve replacements (AVRs) performed in the United States. In conjunction with the rapid expansion of TAVR, the number of TAVR valves requiring surgical explantation (TAVR-explant) has also increased due to procedure-related failure, endocarditis, structural valve degeneration with unfavorable anatomy for redo-TAVR, paravalvular leak, delayed migration, or prosthesis-patient mismatch. Often involving concomitant cardiac surgery, TAVR-explant has been associated with higher operative mortality than redo-SAVR. TAVR-explant is currently the fastest-growing cardiac procedure in the United States and is expected to continue growing, especially as TAVR is increasingly used for lower surgical risk and younger patients. Accordingly, describing and disseminating a standardized set of technical principles for performing TAVR-explant is essential for preparing all cardiac surgeons to appropriately treat these patients. TAVR-explant requires a comprehensive preoperative clinical and cross-sectional imaging assessment to plan an effective operation, including cannulation, aortotomy, explantation, and implantation strategies. Particular considerations for self-expanding and balloon-expandable TAVR valves are important for guiding the operation and optimizing outcomes. Special considerations, such as the need for concomitant aortic, coronary, or mitral valve surgery and the presence of snorkel coronary artery stents adjacent to the TAVR valve, must be considered and addressed at the time of TAVR-explant surgery. Currently, TAVR-explant confers a high operative mortality and is performed at very low volumes per surgeon. As this operation becomes increasingly common, it will become essential for all cardiac surgeons to understand and implement the operation's various techniques to optimize patient outcomes.",Alexander A Brescia,Puja Kachroo,Tsuyoshi Kaneko,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Annals of cardiothoracic surgery,2025-03-31,10.21037/acs-2024-etavr-12,https://doi.org/10.21037/acs-2024-etavr-12,PMC12013762,Free,14,2,157-164,TAVR explant various techniques BRESCIA 2025,pdfs\TAVR explant various techniques BRESCIA 2025.pdf,aortic valve replacement,aortic valve,TAVR,Transcatheter aortic valve,valve,TAVR valves,valve replacement,aortic,Surgical aortic valve,United States,2025-04-30,,,Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR),aortic stenosis,endocarditis,surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR),,,,,,,
6812ea844ef6922f6d69069c,40270850,The current state of redo transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and limitations: why TAVR explant is important as the valve reintervention strategy.,"The rise of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) over the past two decades has substantially changed the lifetime management of patients with aortic valve disease. As the indications for TAVR expand to include younger and lower-risk patients, the proportion of patients who subsequently require reintervention for failed transcatheter heart valves (THVs) will increase. The two primary options for reintervention are redo TAVR and TAVR explant followed by surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). The indications for redo TAVR in the short term include emergency ""bailout"" procedures due to malpositioning, embolization, or long-term device failure due to paravalvular leak (PVL) or valvular degeneration. However, redo TAVR is not suitable for all patients. Those with prohibitive coronary anatomy, multivalvular involvement, severe patient-prosthetic mismatch, or endocarditis should be referred for TAVR explant, which is a comparatively higher-risk procedure. Redo TAVR has generally been associated with low mortality and complication rates, with key procedural considerations being valve selection [e.g., sizing, balloon-expandable valve (BEV) vs. self-expandable valve (SEV)], access, and coronary protection. TAVR explant poses numerous technical challenges, including concomitant ascending aorta or aortic root replacement, mitral valve involvement, or adhesions to the coronary ostia. Compared to redo TAVR, TAVR explant is associated with higher rates of short-term mortality and periprocedural complications. The 30-day mortality rates of TAVR explant approach 20%, and 1-year mortality rates range from 20% to 30%, with significantly greater risk associated with concomitant procedures. The data on both redo TAVR and TAVR explant are limited to observational cohorts without long-term follow-up. Given that patient populations and indications for redo TAVR and TAVR explant are vastly different, direct comparisons of outcomes between these two groups should be avoided. Nonetheless, multidisciplinary Heart Team collaboration remains imperative to advancing our knowledge of redo TAVR or TAVR explant procedures and the careful lifetime management of patients with aortic valve disease.",Grace S Lee,Gilbert Tang,Syed Zaid,Derrick Y Tam,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Annals of cardiothoracic surgery,2025-03-31,10.21037/acs-2024-etavr-0149,https://doi.org/10.21037/acs-2024-etavr-0149,PMC12013764,Free,14,2,98-111,The current state of redo TAVR TAVR and limitations why TAVR explant is important as the valve reintervention strategy LEE 2025,pdfs\The current state of redo TAVR TAVR and limitations why TAVR explant is important as the valve reintervention strategy LEE 2025.pdf,TAVR,redo TAVR,TAVR explant,aortic valve replacement,aortic valve,valve,TAVR explant procedures,redo,transcatheter aortic valve,valve replacement,2025-04-30,,,Redo transcatheter aortic valve replacement (redo TAVR),TAVR,TAVR explant,aortic valve replacement,transcatheter,,,,,,

We aimed to update a systematic review and conduct a meta-analysis of reconstructed time-to-event data from randomized control trials (RCTs) in low-/intermediate-risk patients.\nMETHODS: Systematic searches were performed in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL, and specific websites up to November 2023, for RCTs. A meta-analysis was performed using the reconstructed time-to-event data from the provided Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves from the included RCTs. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, and the secondary outcomes included a composite outcome (all-cause mortality and disabling stroke), and heart failure rehospitalization. Landmark analysis for endpoints beyond 1 year was performed. The study protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42023487893).\nRESULTS: Six RCTs with a total of 7,389 patients were included. The survival was comparable between both groups [hazard ratio (HR), 1.03; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.93-1.14; P=0.57]. The composite outcome and heart failure rehospitalization were comparable between the two groups. Lower mortality with TAVR was observed compared to SAVR before 1 year (HR, 0.82; 95% CI: 0.68-0.98; P=0.03), while TAVR was associated with higher risk of mortality beyond 1 year (HR, 1.13; 95% CI: 1.01-1.27; P=0.04). Similarly, the TAVR group was associated with lower risk for the composite endpoint and heart failure rehospitalization before 1 year, but with higher rates beyond 1 year.\nCONCLUSIONS: Among low- to intermediate-risk patients, TAVR was found to be associated with favorable outcomes in the short-term (0-1 year). However, our landmark analysis demonstrated TAVR to be associated with poorer outcomes beyond 1 year.",Tomonari Shimoda,Yoshihisa Miyamoto,Junichi Shimamura,Hiroki Ueyama,Yujiro Yokoyama,Michel Pompeu Sá,Tsuyoshi Kaneko,Tomo Ando,Hisato Takagi,Shinichi Fukuhara,Toshiki Kuno,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Annals of cardiothoracic surgery,2025-03-31,10.21037/acs-2024-etavr-0096,https://doi.org/10.21037/acs-2024-etavr-0096,PMC12013772,Free,14,2,73-84,Transcatheter versus SAVR in low to intermediate risk Pts a meta analysis of reconstructed time to event data SHIMODA 2025,pdfs\Transcatheter versus SAVR in low to intermediate risk Pts a meta analysis of reconstructed time to event data SHIMODA 2025.pdf,TAVR,aortic valve replacement,aortic valve,intermediate-risk patients,surgical aortic valve,patients,Medical Center,USA,aortic,valve replacement,2025-04-30,,,Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR),aortic stenosis (AS),meta-analysis,surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR),,,,,,,

The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024529188).\nRESULTS: Twenty-eight studies met the eligibility criteria. Almost all studies were non-randomized, observational, and retrospective. The incidence of TAVR explant ranged from 0.2% to 2.8% in patients with a mean age of 67.3-79.0 years, and women representing 25.0-47.1% of cases. The mean time between TAVR implant and explant was 17.0-674.9 days, with most studies reporting a mean time <365 days. Whereas the Society of Thoracic Surgeons-Predicted Risk of Mortality (STS-PROM) score at the time of the TAVR implant ranged between 2.6% and 7.7% (with only one study with score >5%), the STS-PROM score at the time of the TAVR explant ranged between 3.9% and 9.9% (with 17 studies with score >5%). Isolated surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) happened in 16.2-100% of cases, aortic root replacement was required in 2.6-41.2%, ascending aortic replacement was performed in 3.2-33.3% of cases. Mitral valve repair/replacement was necessary in 11.8-43.5% and tricuspid valve/repair replacement was done in 2.8-25.0%. Stroke rates were between 0.0% and 20.0% with most studies with rates above 4.0%. The 30-day death rate ranged from 4.8% to 50.0% with most studies with mortality rates higher than 10%. Observed-to-expected mortality ratio was higher than 1.0 in almost all the studies that reported this variable.\nCONCLUSIONS: TAVR explant remains a rare event, but its clinical impact is non-negligible.

This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the mean changes in key echocardiographic parameters before and after TAVR and to compare these changes between patients with moderate-to-severe MR (MR ≥ 2) and those with none-to-mild MR (MR < 2).\nMETHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted using six electronic databases. We included studies that evaluated patients undergoing TAVR, classified them based on baseline MR grade ≥ 2 (moderate/severe MR) or MR grade < 2 (none/mild MR), and reported the mean difference (MD) in echocardiographic parameters before and after TAVR in both groups. The primary outcomes included changes in ejection fraction (EF), LV end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) index, LV end-systolic volume (LVESV) index, LV end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), LV end-systolic diameter (LVESD), aortic valve area (AVA), and the mean aortic gradient. Pooled MDs were analyzed using a random-effects model.\nRESULTS: Thirteen studies with 7163 patients were included, of which 2376 had an MR ≥ 2. The MR < 2 and MR ≥ 2 groups experienced significant improvements in AVA and reductions in mean aortic gradient, LVEDV index, LVESV index, LVEDD, and LVESD. Compared to MR < 2 patients, those with MR ≥ 2 exhibited significantly greater improvements in EF (MD = 2.03; 95% CI: 0.81, 3.24), LVEDV index (MD = -5.55; 95% CI: -7.85, -3.26), LVESV index (MD = -5.43; 95% CI: -7.28, -3.58), LVESD (MD = -2.23; 95% CI: -3.71, -0.26), and mean aortic gradient (MD = 1.43; 95% CI: 0.79, 2.07). However, the changes in LVEDD and AVA were not significantly different between the groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that patients with moderate-to-severe baseline MR before TAVR showed greater pronounced improvements in specific echocardiographic parameters related to LV function and geometry, particularly in LVEF, LVEDV index, LVESV index, and LVESD, compared to those with none-to-mild MR. Future studies should focus on stratifying outcomes according to MR etiology and using advanced imaging techniques to delineate better the mechanisms underlying these improvements.",Bahar Darouei,Reza Amani-Beni,Mehrdad Rabiee Rad,Ghazal Ghasempour Dabaghi,Reza Eshraghi,Ashkan Bahrami,Ehsan Amini-Salehi,Seyyed Mohammad Hashemi,Sadegh Mazaheri-Tehrani,Mohammad Reza Movahed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,2025-04-24,10.1002/ccd.31555,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.31555,,Paid,,,,The Impact of Concomitant MR on Echocardiography Parameters After TAVR A Systematic Review and Meta Analysis DAROUEI 2025,Not available,Concomitant Mitral Regurgitation,Aortic Valve Replacement,Impact of Concomitant,Systematic Review,Concomitant Mitral,TransCatheter Aortic Valve,Mitral Regurgitation,Valve Replacement,Aortic Valve,Echocardiography Parameters,2025-04-30,rejected,,aortic valve stenosis,echocardiography,meta‐analysis,mitral valve insufficiency,transcatheter aortic valve replacement,,,,,,

This systematic review examined the association between computed tomography (CT)-derived adipose tissue parameters and TAVI outcomes. We searched major databases for studies on visceral (VAT), subcutaneous (SAT), and intramuscular (IMAT) adipose tissue parameters and post-TAVI outcomes. Fourteen studies (9692 patients) were included. Higher SAT area/volume was consistently associated with better survival (5 studies, HR range: 0.83-2.77, p < 0.05). Lower SAT and VAT density also correlated with better survival (5 and 4 studies, respectively, HR range: 1.31-1.46, p < 0.05). VAT area showed mixed results. A VAT:SAT ratio < 1 was associated with better cardiovascular outcomes in one study. Lower IMAT index correlated with shorter hospital stays in a single study. This review reveals complex relationships between adipose tissue parameters and TAVI outcomes. Lower adipose tissue density and higher subcutaneous adiposity were most consistently associated with better outcomes.

At present, the impact of POAF on cardiac remodeling after TAVR has not been thoroughly studied.\nOBJECTIVES: To investigate the impact of POAF on cardiac remodeling and its association with clinical outcomes after TAVR.\nMETHODS: 601 patients undergoing TAVR for severe aortic stenosis were evaluated. Of these, 253 patients were identified to have POAF, which was categorized as normal left ventricular mass index (LVMI) in 54 (21%) and high LVMI in 199 (79%). The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause death, heart failure rehospitalization and disabling stroke. Reverse remodeling was assessed by transthoracic echocardiography.\nRESULTS: In POAF patients, the 3-year cumulative incidence of primary composite outcome in the high LVMI subgroup was significantly higher than that in the normal LVMI subgroup (9.3 ± 3.3% vs. 13.5 ± 3.9%; p = 0.02). The incidence of LVMI regression after TAVR was lower in patients with POAF than in those without (65.6 ± 3.0% vs. 82.6 ± 2.7% at 3 years; p = 0.029). Furthermore, the 3-year cumulative incidence of the primary composite outcome and cardiovascular death was highest in the group of POAF without LVMI regression. Baseline LVMI (β = -1.73, p < 0.001) and POAF (β = -1.46, p < 0.001) were independent predictors of change in LVMI at one year.\nCONCLUSIONS: Patients with POAF had less LVMI regression and impaired cardiac reverse remodeling after TAVR, which increased the incidence of all-cause death and heart failure rehospitalization.

This study was designed to assess the prognostic value of the V/M ratio for predicting major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).\nMETHODS: This study enrolled patients who received a standard planning computed tomography (CT) scan before TAVR and dichotomized at the median of 33.31 mm³/g of V/M ratio into groups with low V/M ratio and high V/M ratio. The V/M ratio was calculated by coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA). The endpoint was a composite of all-cause mortality, stroke, and hospitalization for heart failure. The cumulative incidence of the MACE was compared using Kaplan-Meyer plots and uni- and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis.\nRESULTS: In total, 139 patients were enrolled in this study finally (mean age 71.7 ± 6.7 years, 41.7% female). The mean V/M ratio was considerably lower in patients with MACE than in those without MACE (26.5 ± 4.9mm3/g vs. 34.0 ± 3.8mm3/g, P<0.001). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression showed that the low V/M ratio group (≤ 33.31 mm³/g) had a higher risk of MACE after TAVR (HR: 6.14, 95%CI: 1.37-27.54; P = 0.018).\nCONCLUSIONS: The lower V/M ratio could serve as an independent predictor of MACE in patients undergoing TAVR.\nCLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable.",Wenting Li,Ruichen Ren,Qingyuan Zhao,Chengcheng Qi,Zhiyu Chen,Yang Zhang,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,BMC cardiovascular disorders,2025-04-24,10.1186/s12872-025-04705-9,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12872-025-04705-9,PMC12020294,Free,25,1,311,CT based coronary lumen volume to myocardial mass ratio in Pts undergoing TAVR a novel method for risk assessment LI 2025,pdfs\CT based coronary lumen volume to myocardial mass ratio in Pts undergoing TAVR a novel method for risk assessment LI 2025.pdf,coronary lumen volume,patients undergoing TAVR,coronary,ratio,coronary lumen,patients,patients undergoing,patients undergoing transcatheter,MACE,TAVR,2025-04-30,rejected,,Coronary computed tomography angiography,Coronary lumen volume,Left ventricle myocardial mass,Transcatheter aortic valve replacement,Volume to myocardial mass,,,,,,

Considering that in aortic stenosis outcomes are governed by both valve degeneration and myocardial adverse remodeling, we aimed to evaluate machine-learning leveraging pre-procedural computed tomography (CT) for the prediction of 1-year mortality following TAVR. The analysis included data of consecutive patients who underwent TAVR at a high-volume center between January 2017 and January 2022 and was externally validated on unseen data from 3 international sites. Machine learning by extreme gradient boosting was trained and tested using clinical variables, CT-derived volumetric measurements including myocardial mass, and quantitative fibrocalcific aortic valve characteristics measured using standardized software. The EuroScore II and a separate machine learning risk score based exclusively on baseline clinical characteristics served as comparators. The derivation cohort included 631 consecutive patients (48 % men, 80 ± 8 years old, EuroSCORE II 6.5 [4.6-10.3] %). Machine learning was externally validated on data of 596 patients (48 % men, 81 ± 8 years old, EuroSCORE II 5.4 [4.7-8.1] %). In external validation, the machine learning prognostic risk score had an area under the receiver operator curve of 0.79 (0.74-0.84) which was superior to the EuroSCORE 0.59 (0.53-0.66), and the machine learning risk based on clinical data alone 0.64 (0.59-0.69), p < 0.001 for difference.

We designed a systematic review and meta-analysis of reconstructed time-to-event (RTE) data from propensity score matching studies comparing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) to compare their effectiveness and evaluate the generalizability of TAVI indications.\nMETHODS: Systematic review of literature between 2007 and 2023 including propensity score matching studies comparing TAVI or SAVR that reported at least one-year Kaplan-Meier curves of endpoints.\nRESULTS: Twenty-one studies were included (39538 participants). TAVI shows a higher all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.41; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.34-1.47, P-value < 0.001), with a significant heterogeneity. The analysis of HR trend over time shows that TAVI superiority is limited to the first month with a steep reversal afterwards, when SAVR becomes clearly superior. All-cause mortality is significantly higher in TAVI in low-risk (HR 1.35; 95% CI 1.08-1.69, P-value < 0.001) as well as in intermediate (HR 1.73; 95% CI 1.35-2.22, P-value < 0.001) and high-risk (HR 1.61; 95% CI 1.38-1.88, P-value < 0.001) patients. The HR trend in the subgroups of risk confirms the data from the whole mixed population.\nCONCLUSION: In a real-word setting, TAVI is associated with higher incidence of all-cause death and maintains a survival benefit only in the first month after implantation. These results show that TAVI effectiveness may not reflect the efficacy demonstrated by RCTs and pose a threat to their external validity.",Mateo Marin-Cuartas,Bianca Dalbesio,Francesco Pollari,Matteo Scarpanti,Amedeo Anselmi,Manuela de la Cuesta,Miguel Sousa Uva,Jean-Philippe Verhoye,Francesco Musumeci,Fabio Barili,Alessandro Parolari,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Brazilian journal of cardiovascular surgery,2025-04-23,10.21470/1678-9741-2024-0048,https://doi.org/10.21470/1678-9741-2024-0048,PMC12017277,Free,40,4,e20240048,Five Year Mortality of Surgical and TAVR in the Real World Scenario A Systematic Review and Meta Analysis of PSM Studies MARIN-CUARTAS 2025,pdfs\Five Year Mortality of Surgical and TAVR in the Real World Scenario A Systematic Review and Meta Analysis of PSM Studies MARIN-CUARTAS 2025.pdf,Cardiac Surgery,Transcatheter Aortic Valve,Aortic Valve Replacement,TAVI,Aortic Valve,Propensity Score Matching,studies comparing TAVI,Score Matching Studies,surgical aortic valve,Cardiac Surgery Unit,2025-04-30,approved,,Aortic Valve,Meta-Analysis,Systematic Review,Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement,,,,,,,

Overall, 69 patients (85.2%) underwent successful transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), which significantly improves myocardial longitudinal systolic function. MACE occurred in 12 (14.8%) AS patients during the follow-up period.\nCONCLUSION: TMAD parameters allowed early detection of left ventricle systolic dysfunction (LVSF) in severe AS patients with normal ejection fraction and correlated well with LVGLS, and TMADmid-A4C was a strong predictor of MACE in severe AS patients with preserved LVEF.",Jie Feng,Yao Li,Shiyuan Zhang,Haixia Wei,Hangyu Liu,Yanqing Wu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal of clinical ultrasound : JCU,2025-04-23,10.1002/jcu.24032,https://doi.org/10.1002/jcu.24032,,Paid,,,,Evaluation of Tissue Annular Motion Displacement in Pts With sAS With Normal EF FENG 2025,Not available,Tissue Annular Motion,Annular Motion Displacement,Severe Aortic Stenosis,Normal Ejection Fraction,Annular Motion,Tissue Annular,Motion Displacement,Simpson method ejection,Ejection Fraction,method ejection fraction,2025-04-30,,,LVEF,aortic stenosis,speckle tracking imaging,tissue motion annular displacement,transthoracic echocardiography,,,,,,

Preoperative planning requires cautious identification of the access route, which can be challenging in patients with anatomical abnormalities of the aorta. Double aortic arch (DAA) is a congenital condition where the aorta bifurcates into two separate vessels that encircle the trachea and esophagus, thereby forming a vascular ring. This condition accounts for ~1% of congenital cardiovascular anomalies. Previous reports on TAVR performed on patients with DAA are limited, and there is no consensus on the appropriate access route. Herein, we present an 85-year-old female patient with DAA and aortic stenosis who underwent a successful TAVR using the direct aortic approach.",Akihito Arai,Mimiko Tabata,Kenichiro Takahashi,Ryo Izubuchi,Minako Hayakawa,Joshi Tsutsumi,Akihiro Urabe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal of surgical case reports,2025-04-30,10.1093/jscr/rjaf251,https://doi.org/10.1093/jscr/rjaf251,PMC12013706,Free,2025,4,rjaf251,TAVR via direct aortic access for sAS with double aortic arch ARAI 2025,pdfs\TAVR via direct aortic access for sAS with double aortic arch ARAI 2025.pdf,aortic,Transcatheter aortic valve,double aortic arch,direct aortic approach,aortic valve replacement,aortic arch,TAVR,severe aortic stenosis,aortic valve,direct aortic,2025-04-30,approved,,direct aortic approach,double aortic arch,transcatheter aortic valve replacement,,,,,,,,
6812eaaa4ef6922f6d6906ac,40262657,SINGLE PERCLOSE PLUS PLUG BASED DEVICE VERSUS DOUBLE PERCLOSE FOR PERCUTANEOUS LARGE BORE ARTERIAL ACCESS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META ANALYSIS.,"OBJECTIVE: Vascular Closure primarily utilizing Suture Based Devices (SBD) are frequently used for large bore percutaneous arterial access in patients undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVR) and Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (EVAR). Little is known about the intentional combination of SBD with PBD. Main objective was to determine the efficacy of adopting a combined SBD and PBD strategy compared to double SBD for large bore arterial access.\nREVIEW METHODS: We searched randomized and observational studies comparing both strategies and that reported the outcomes of major vascular and vascular complications, major bleeding, all bleeding events, need for surgical or endovascular interventions, device failure, additional device and pseudoaneurysm. A meta-analysis was conducted, with heterogeneity assessed using the I2 statistic and a random-effects model applied to all outcomes. Additionally, trial sequential analysis was performed.\nRESULTS: We included 3 randomized trials and 4 observational studies with 2,064 access. Sheath size ranged from 13 to 24 Fr. Vascular complications (RR 0.54; p<0.01), major vascular complications (RR 0.55; p=0.04), major bleeding (RR 0.49; p=0.02), need for surgical intervention (RR 0.25; p=0.01), and additional device (RR 0.12; p<0.01) were significantly less common in patients treated with the SBD and PBD technique. Pseudoaneurysm (RR 1.13; p=0.71), all bleeding events (RR 0.59; p=0.1), and endovascular intervention (RR 0.65; p=0.26) were not significantly different between groups.\nCONCLUSION: These findings suggest that one SBD, combined with PBD, was associated with less femoral access complications when compared to the exclusive double SBD as a vascular closure strategy in patients with large bore arterial access.",Enrico Prajiante Bertolino,Milena Monteiro Mastra Fontoura,Cynthia Florêncio de Mesquita,Dilson da Silva Pimentel,Miguel Godeiro Fernandez,Ivo Queiroz,Braiana Ángeles Díaz Herrera,Altino Ono Moraes,Ross Millner,Grace Carvajal Mulatti,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Annals of vascular surgery,2025-04-20,10.1016/j.avsg.2025.04.107,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.avsg.2025.04.107,,Paid,,,,SINGLE PERCLOSE PLUS PLUG BASED DEVICE VERSUS DOUBLE PERCLOSE FOR PERCUTANEOUS LARGE BORE ARTERIAL ACCESS A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META ANALYSIS BERTOLINO 2025,Not available,VERSUS DOUBLE PERCLOSE,SINGLE PERCLOSE,PLUG BASED DEVICE,BASED DEVICE VERSUS,LARGE BORE ARTERIAL,BORE ARTERIAL ACCESS,Aortic Valve Implantation,DEVICE VERSUS DOUBLE,Transcatheter Aortic Valve,PERCLOSE PLUS PLUG,2025-04-30,,,Angioseal,Closure device,Endovascular aneurysm repair,Perclose,Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement,vascular closure,,,,,

However, the effects of baseline concomitant mitral regurgitation (MR) on perioperative outcomes remain unclear. This study evaluated the impact of concomitant MR severity on short-term TAVR outcomes. A systematic search of 6 electronic databases was conducted. Studies that stratified patients based on MR severity (MR ≥2 vs. <2 or MR ≥3 vs. <3) and reported perioperative outcomes, including short-term mortality, in-hospital mortality, acute kidney injury (AKI), pacemaker implantation, bleeding, vascular complications, and MR improvement (up to 1 week and 1 month) were eligible. Data from 26 studies (32,453 patients) demonstrated that patients with baseline moderate-to-severe MR (MR ≥2) had a 49% (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.32-1.70) increased risk of short-term mortality, a 41% (95% CI, 1.22-1.63) higher risk of in-hospital mortality, and a 38% (95% CI, 1.17-1.62) higher risk of AKI than those with none-to-mild MR (MR<2). Patients with an MR ≥3 had an even greater 72% (95% CI, 1.37-2.16) increase in short-term mortality. No significant differences were observed in pacemaker implantation, bleeding, or vascular complications between groups. Additionally, after TAVR, MR improved in 36% of patients by at least 1 grade within 1 week, increasing to 44% by 1 month. In TAVR patients, MR ≥2 was associated with significantly higher early mortality and AKI risk, underscoring the need for a comprehensive perioperative risk assessment.

This study investigates sex-related differences in survival and safety outcomes in patients with aortic stenosis undergoing TAVR.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Library until November 2024. Individual patient data (IPD) were reconstructed from published Kaplan-Meier curves and compared using Cox-proportional hazards model for overall survival and cardiovascular mortality. Pooled risk ratios (RR) for safety outcomes at 30-days and one year were estimated using a random-effects model. A total of 48 studies (69,355 women and 65,580 men) were included. Meta-analysis of reconstructed IPD showed that men were at higher risk of all-cause mortality at five years (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.24, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.20-1.28, P<0.001) and cardiovascular mortality at four years (HR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.21-1.49, P<0.001) compared with women. In random-effects meta-analysis, men faced a higher risk of permanent pacemaker implantation (RR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.16-1.44, P<0.001) during the first year. Men experienced a lower risk of stroke (RR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.64-0.87, P<0.001) and major vascular complications (RR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.49-0.69, P<0.001) at 30 days, and a lower risk of major bleeding (RR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.70-0.84, P<0.001) as well as major vascular complications (RR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.43-0.68, P<0.001) within the first year.\nCONCLUSION: Men demonstrated poorer five-year overall survival and four-year cardiovascular survival following TAVR compared with women.

6812eaac4ef6922f6d6906af,40260550,Impact of Calcified Raphe on TAVR in Bicuspid Patients: Predicting Redo-TAVR Feasibility and Virtual Planning Implications.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with bicuspid aortic stenosis who receive transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) may require subsequent valve interventions in their lifetime; however, the feasibility of redo-TAVR in this population is uncertain. We aimed to assess redo-TAVR feasibility in bicuspid patients and develop a predictive virtual valve planning algorithm.\nMETHODS: We studied computed tomography scans of bicuspid patients who received a balloon-expandable transcatheter heart valve (THV) in the LRT trial (Low Risk TAVR). Redo-TAVR feasibility, determined by valve-to-coronary and valve-to-aorta measurements on 30-day computed tomography, was assessed according to raphe location and calcification. A virtual valve planning algorithm was developed using baseline and 30-day computed tomography scans.\nRESULTS: Among 42 patients (left/right cusp fusion: n=34; right/noncusp fusion: n=4; 2-sinus: n=4), redo-TAVR was feasible in 64%, while 36% would likely require leaflet modification to prevent coronary obstruction. Patients with left/right fusion and calcified raphe had higher redo-TAVR feasibility (88% versus 35%, P<0.001) due to favorable shifting of the THV away from the coronary ostia. A bicuspid virtual planning algorithm accounting for 83.4% THV underexpansion, resulting in an 11.9% taller frame and translation of the THV away from the calcified raphe (mean valve shift 6.6 mm) achieved 86.7% sensitivity and 88.9% specificity for predicting redo-TAVR feasibility.\nCONCLUSIONS: Calcified raphe in left/right cusp fusion shifts the THV away from the coronary ostia, reducing coronary obstruction risk during redo-TAVR. Underexpansion causing increased THV frame height and valve shifting is common in bicuspid patients; a virtual planning algorithm accounting for these aspects can accurately assess redo-TAVR risk.\nREGISTRATION: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT02628899.",Pavan Reddy,Fernando J Rodriguez-Weisson,Giorgio A Medranda,Ilan Merdler,Matteo Cellamare,Paul Gordon,Afshin Ehsan,Puja Parikh,Thomas Bilfinger,Maurice Buchbinder,David Roberts,Nicholas Hanna,Itsik Ben-Dor,Lowell F Satler,Hector M Garcia-Garcia,Federico M Asch,Gaby Weissman,Anita Sadeghpour,Christian C Schults,Ron Waksman,Toby Rogers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Circulation.

The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause death and unplanned rehospitalisation for cardiovascular causes. The secondary endpoint was a composite of all-cause death, stroke, acute myocardial infarction, major bleeding, major vascular complication and unplanned revascularisation. Multivariable analysis was used to adjust for possible confounders.\nRESULTS: A total of 519 patients were included: 363 (69.9%) underwent staged procedures and 156 (30.1%) concomitant TAVI and PCI. After 441 (interquartile range 182-824) days, the primary endpoint occurred in 151 (36.5%) cases, without any significant difference between the 2 groups (p=0.98), while the secondary endpoint occurred more frequently in the concomitant group (n=36 [25.8%] vs n=57 [17.4%]; p=0.014).\nCONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing TAVI and complex/high-risk PCI, a concomitant strategy is associated with a higher rate of adverse events and increased procedural risk.

6812eab14ef6922f6d6906b2,40259836,Prognostic value of invasive versus echocardiography-derived aortic gradient in patients undergoing TAVI.,"BACKGROUND: Recent studies report a discordance between invasive and echocardiography-derived gradients after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) with balloon-expandable (BEV) and self-expanding valves (SEV). There are limited data on the determinants and clinical implications of this discordance.\nAIMS: We aimed to examine the prognostic value of invasive and echocardiography-derived gradients after implantation of SEV and BEV and to compare gradients for SEV versus BEV.\nMETHODS: We performed a retrospective, propensity score-matched study. Invasive measurements were obtained before and immediately after TAVI. Echocardiography was performed before and within 24 hours after TAVI, and at 1 year. Clinical outcomes were assessed at 30 days, 1 year, and 2 years.\nRESULTS: The 1:1 propensity score matching resulted in 436 matched pairs (436 SAPIEN 3 and 436 Evolut). Invasive gradients post-TAVI independently predicted higher risk for all-cause mortality at 30 days, 1 year and 2 years as a continuous variable (hazard ratio [HR] 1.07, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.00-1.14; p=0.038; HR 1.06, 95% CI: 1.01-1.11; p=0.007; HR 1.05, 95% CI: 1.01-1.09; p=0.011, respectively) and by using >10 mmHg as a cutoff (HR 1.95, 95% CI: 1.13-4.78; p=0.028; HR 1.91, 95% CI: 1.11-3.65; p=0.030; HR 1.61, 95% CI: 1.03-2.96; p=0.021, respectively), but echocardiography-derived gradients did not (HR 1.13, 95% CI: 0.87-1.75; p=0.247; HR 1.02, 95% CI: 0.95-1.10; p=0.639; HR 0.99, 95% CI: 0.94-1.07; p=0.979, respectively). Mean gradients before and after TAVI were higher by echocardiography than by invasive measurements. The difference was more pronounced after implantation with BEV than SEV (7.0 [25th-75th percentile: 4.0-11.0] mmHg vs 5.0 [2.0-7.0] mmHg; p<0.001). Smaller valve size, higher ejection fraction and higher stroke volume amplified the discordance. Invasive mean gradients were similar after SEV and BEV (3.0 [0.0-6.0] mmHg vs 3.0 [0.0-6.0] mmHg; p=0.166), but echo-derived mean gradients were lower after SEV versus BEV (8.0 [6.0-11.0] mmHg vs 11.0 [8.0-14.0] mmHg; p<0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: Only invasively measured but not echocardiography-derived transvalvular mean gradients correlate with 30-day, 1-year and 2-year mortality. Aortic gradient measurements are higher by echocardiography than by invasive assessment and more so for BEV than SEV. Smaller valve size, higher ejection fraction and higher stroke volume increase this discordance between echocardiography and invasive assessment.",Mark M P van den Dorpel,Sraman Chatterjee,Rik Adrichem,Sarah Verhemel,Isabella Kardys,Rutger-Jan Nuis,Joost Daemen,Claire Ben Ren,Alexander Hirsch,Marcel L Geleijnse,Nicolas M Van Mieghem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,EuroIntervention : journal of EuroPCR in collaboration with the Working Group on Interventional Cardiology of the European Society of Cardiology,2025-04-21,10.4244/EIJ-D-24-00341,https://doi.org/10.4244/EIJ-D-24-00341,PMC11995293,Paid,21,8,e411-e425,Prognostic value of invasive versus echocardiography derived aortic gradient in Pts undergoing TAVI DORPEL 2025,Not downloaded,patients undergoing TAVI,SEV versus BEV,SEV,BEV,gradients,invasive,TAVI,mmHg,undergoing TAVI,echocardiography-derived gradients,2025-04-30,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6812eab14ef6922f6d6906b3,40258409,The randomized controlled trial to compare temporary permanent pacemaker vs temporary pacemaker in patients with conduction block after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: Rationale and design of the RECOVER trial.,"RATIONALE: Current guidelines and expert consensus recommend different time thresholds of temporary pacemaker (TM) indwelling in patients with conduction block after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Accordingly, this lack of clinical evidence and effective strategies has resulted in extensive variations in permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation patterns, potentially leading to over-early PPM implantation. The use of a temporary permanent pacemaker (TPPM), which involves an active fixation pacing lead and an external pulse generator secured to the skin surface, may be effective and safe in these patients. TPPM may improve postoperative mobility and facilitate early discharge, while providing prolonged and stable pacing for the recovery of conduction block, thereby reducing unnecessary PPM implantation.\nDESIGN: The RECOVER trial is a prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled study comparing TPPM vs TM in patients with conduction block after TAVR. The trial will enroll 160 subjects across 13 sites in China. Inclusion criteria include patients with persistent third-degree atrioventricular block (AVB), second-degree AVB, first-degree AVB with symptoms (PR interval >300 ms), alternating bundle branch block or bifascicular block with syncope/blackness related symptoms occurred during TAVR procedure or within 1 month after TAVR. Enrolled patients will be randomized 1:1 to the TPPM group for a 1-month bridge or the TM group for conventional 24 to 48 hours pacing. The primary effectiveness endpoint is the rate of PPM implantation at 6 months after the occurrence of AVB. Secondary effectiveness endpoint is the rate of PPM implantation at 1 month after the occurrence of AVB. Safety endpoints include all-cause mortality and TPPM/TM/PPM procedure-related complications during the 6-month follow-up. Key data collected will include sociodemographic information, medical history, electrocardiograph, HOLTER, echocardiography, contrast-enhanced cardiac CT, details of procedures and pacemaker interrogation. Indication for PPM implantation will be adjudicated by an independent pacing electrophysiologist committee.\nCONCLUSION: The RECOVER trial will evaluate whether TPPM is superior to conventional TM in reducing the rate of PPM implantation in patients with conduction block after TAVR, with a buffer period to distinguish whether conduction block is reversible or persistent.\nCURRENT STATUS: The trial is still enrolling participants (with 14 enrolled as of January 1, 2025).\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: Randomized controlled trial to compare temporary permanent pacemaker vs temporary pacemaker in patients with conduction block after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

6812eab34ef6922f6d6906b6,40254143,Management of TAVR in asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients: Insights from resting angiographic microvascular resistance.,"BACKGROUND: The optimal timing of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) remains controversial. Microvascular dysfunction and increased microcirculatory resistance have been linked to adverse outcomes in AS, suggesting that resting angiographic microvascular resistance (AMRr) may aid in identifying higher-risk patients.\nMETHOD: We conducted a retrospective study of 180 severe AS patients who underwent TAVR at Fuwai Hospital between 2012 and 2021. Patients were grouped based on an AMRr cutoff value of 490, identified through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The primary endpoint was the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), including all-cause mortality, heart failure, and myocardial infarction. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were used to compare outcomes between groups.\nRESULTS: A total of 180 asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic AS patients undergoing TAVR were enrolled. After a 40-month follow-up, the AMRr >490 group had a higher MACE risk, mainly driven by readmission for heart failure. Additionally, continuous analysis indicated that every 100-unit increase in AMRr was associated with an 18 %, 17 %, and 1.58-fold increased risk of MACE, all-cause mortality, and NOAF, respectively. Moreover, the addition of AMRr to a clinical model significantly improved the prediction of MACE (AUC 0.678 vs. 0.582, p = 0.023).\nCONCLUSION: Asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic AS patients with AMRr >490 had a significantly higher incidence of MACE and heart failure rehospitalization than those with AMRr ≤490 after TAVR. The inclusion of AMRr in a predictive model improved the accuracy for long-term MACE, demonstrating an incremental prognostic value.",Wence Shi,Moyang Wang,Guannan Niu,Zhenyan Zhao,Zheng Zhou,Dejing Feng,Yongjian Wu,Hongliang Zhang,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,International journal of cardiology,2025-04-18,10.1016/j.ijcard.2025.133263,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcard.2025.133263,,Paid,432,,133263,Management of TAVR in asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic Pts Insights from resting angiographic microvascular resistance SHI 2025,Not available,angiographic microvascular resistance,resting angiographic microvascular,asymptomatic or minimally,minimally symptomatic patients,minimally symptomatic,TAVR,MACE,patients,Insights from resting,angiographic microvascular,2025-04-30,,,Asymptomatic aortic stenosis,Microvascular dysfunction,Resting angiographic microvascular resistance,Transcatheter aortic valve replacement,,,,,,,

TAVR with a self-expanding valve was performed but complicated with valve migration toward the left ventricle, resulting in severe paravalvular regurgitation. Ultimately, the valve dragging technique was used to reposition the initial valve and a second valve was implanted, achieving satisfactory final outcomes.\nDISCUSSION: This technique provides a novel strategy for valve migration after TAVR, avoiding surgical reintervention.\nTAKE-HOME MESSAGE: The valve dragging technique is a remedial measure for severe paravalvular regurgitation secondary to valve migration after self-expanding TAVR by dragging with a second valve.",Yinghao Sun,Jie Li,Yuan Liu,Jianfang Luo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JACC.

Acute aortic dissection, although rare, is a life-threatening complication associated with TAVR.\nCASE SUMMARY: An older man with severe aortic stenosis underwent TAVR. During valve deployment, catheter manipulation caused intimal disruption, leading to acute type A aortic dissection (TAAD). Remarkably, the dissection spontaneously sealed after prosthetic valve placement, thereby avoiding emergency surgery. A 6-month follow-up computed tomography angiography scan showed no extension of the dissection.\nDISCUSSION: In the case we report, the dissection spontaneously sealed with the use of a prosthetic valve, a finding that reinforces the feasibility of nonsurgical management of iatrogenic TAAD during TAVR in select cases.\nTAKE-HOME MESSAGE: The use of a biological valve offers a novel perspective on the conservative management of iatrogenic aortic dissection in high-risk patients during TAVR.",Lianyue Ma,Yongfeng Liang,Wei Gao,Mei Dong,Xiangjuan Liu,Yuan Cao,Xiao Meng,Guipeng An,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JACC.

Emergency surgery was performed. It involved initiation of extracorporeal circulatory support, followed by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and, subsequently, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) using a TaurusElite valve (Peijia Medical).

He was diagnosed with severe AS with aortic valve insufficiency (penetrating aortic ulcer) and had multiple comorbidities. The patient underwent a 1-stop TEVAR + TAVR procedure.\nDISCUSSION: The challenge was compounded by the patient's extremely narrow femoral access.

Post-procedural incremental paravalvular leak (PVL) due to aneurysm-related malapposition was successfully treated with a self-expanding valve-in-valve (ViV) prosthesis (TaurusElite, 29 mm). Multimodal imaging, including echocardiography, computed tomography angiography, and 3-dimensional-printed modeling, ensured precise sealing with excellent hemodynamic results.\nDISCUSSION: We report the first case of self-expanding ViV for PVL after J-Valve TAVR in type 0 BAV with aortic root aneurysm. This case underscores the feasibility of self-expanding ViV in complex BAV anatomy with concomitant aortic root pathology sighting into optimal device selection and imaging integration.\nTAKE-HOME MESSAGES: Self-expanding prostheses are preferred for BAV with concomitant aortic root pathology due to adaptive sealing capabilities.

Random-effect model (DerSimonian-Laird method) was used to pool the risk ratios (RR), mean differences, and 95% confidence intervals (CI).\nRESULTS: A total of 10 studies comprising 4325 patients (2295 BEV, 2030 SEV) were included. In short-term, cardiovascular (RR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.36-0.87) and all-cause mortality (RR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.35-0.81) were lower in the BEV group. Risk of moderate to severe paravalvular leak (PVL) was lower among BEV patients in short-term (RR: 0.28, 95% CI: 0.17-0.49) and long-term (RR: 0.28, 95% CI: 0.1-0.79). A limited number of studies showed a greater risk of clinical valve thrombosis on BEV in midterm and long-term. The need for permanent pacemaker implantation was lower in BEV at both short-term (RR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.37-0.87), and midterm (RR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.64-0.94). The SEV group had a larger effective orifice area with lower mean transvalvular pressure gradient at all endpoints.\nCONCLUSIONS: BEV is associated with reduced risk of clinical outcomes in short-term; however, most differences diminish in longer evaluations, except for moderate to severe PVL, which remains elevated for SEV.

The NOTION study represents the first randomized clinical trial to reach a 10-year follow-up in patients at low surgical risk, comparing TAVI with surgical valve replacement (SAVR). The results show comparable clinical outcomes between TAVI and SAVR in terms of all-cause mortality, stroke, and myocardial infarction. TAVI demonstrated a better haemodynamic profile and a lower incidence of structural valve deterioration (SVD), but showed higher rates of pacemaker requirement and paravalvular leakage compared with surgical replacement. The trial highlights the excellent durability of transcatheter bioprostheses, although new-generation devices and advanced techniques could further reduce adverse events.

6812eac44ef6922f6d6906c5,40248296,Even aortic insufficiency can be treated percutaneously: right?,"Moderate or severe aortic insufficiency (AI) is a relatively rare condition but with significant clinical implications, especially in elderly patients at high surgical risk. Although surgical aortic valve replacement remains the gold standard for treatment, a significant proportion of patients are not eligible due to the high surgical risk. In recent years, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has revolutionized the treatment of aortic stenosis, but its application to AI has encountered significant challenges, mainly related to specific anatomical characteristics of this population. This review provides an overview of the evolution of the transcatheter treatment of AI, highlighting the critical issues of first-generation TAVI devices and the improvements achieved with new-generation and dedicated devices, such as JenaValve and J-Valve. Preliminary data demonstrate encouraging procedural results, including a reduction in residual insufficiency and improved safety in patients at high surgical risk. However, limitations remain, including the high incidence of pacemaker implantation and the lack of long-term randomized clinical trials. In light of technological advances, TAVI represents a promising therapeutic option for selected patients with AI, if performed in high-volume centres with extensive experience in the treatment of aortic disease.",Nicolò Azzola Guicciardi,Alessandro Beneduce,Francesco Maisano,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,European heart journal supplements : journal of the European Society of Cardiology,2025-03-30,10.1093/eurheartjsupp/suaf026,https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartjsupp/suaf026,PMC12001779,Free,27,Suppl 3,iii105-iii110,Even AI can be treated percutaneously right?

6812eac44ef6922f6d6906c6,40243974,5-Year Echocardiographic Results of Transcatheter Versus Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement in Low-Risk Patients.,"BACKGROUND: The PARTNER 3 (Safety and Effectiveness of the SAPIEN 3 Transcatheter Heart Valve in Low Risk Patients with Aortic Stenosis) trial compared SAPIEN 3 transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) to surgery in low-risk patients with symptomatic, severe aortic stenosis. Echocardiographic outcomes at 5 years are unknown.\nOBJECTIVES: This study sought to compare 5-year echocardiographic results of TAVR and surgery in the PARTNER 3 trial.\nMETHODS: Echocardiograms for 1,000 randomized patients were obtained at baseline, 30 days, 1 year, and annually through 5 years and were analyzed by a core lab consortium. The composite primary endpoint of death, stroke, or rehospitalization was adjudicated by a clinical events committee.\nRESULTS: At 5 years, ≥ mild aortic regurgitation was higher following TAVR vs surgery (24.5% vs 6.3%; P < 0.001), with low ≥ moderate aortic regurgitation in both groups. TAVR patients had higher mean transaortic gradient (12.8 ± 6.5 vs 11.7 ± 5.6 mm Hg; P < 0.001), stroke volume index (44.6 ± 9.7 vs 41.1 ± 9.2; P < 0.0001), and aortic valve area (1.87 ± 0.46 vs 1.82 ± 0.46; P = 0.895). Fewer TAVR patients had low-flow stroke volume index (P < 0.001) and left ventricular hemodynamic burden (valvulo-arterial impedance; P < 0.01). Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion was also higher with TAVR (P < 0.001), as was right ventricular-to-pulmonary artery coupling (P < 0.0001). In the combined cohorts, 30-day moderate to severe prosthesis-patient mismatch, mild to severe aortic regurgitation, or low stroke volume index were not predictive of clinical outcomes; only low right ventricular-to-pulmonary artery coupling and high valvulo-arterial impedance at 30 days were associated with increased risk of the 5-year composite primary endpoint.\nCONCLUSIONS: In low-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis, TAVR, compared to surgery, was associated with similar, stable valve hemodynamics at 5 years with less frequent low-flow state, lower valvulo-arterial impedance, and better right ventricular function.

The risk of coronary obstruction was evaluated using virtual transcatheter heart valve-to-coronary ostium distance (VTC) and transcatheter heart valve-to-aorta distance (VTA).\nRESULTS: Both groups showed significant increases in annulus and SOV sizes; however, only the Konno group exhibited a significant increase in LVOT size. The distance from the valve center to the coronary ostia was significantly greater in the Konno group compared to the Y-incision group (+4.2 ± 3.5 mm for the left/right coronary artery in the Konno group vs +2.4 ± 0.6 mm in the Y-incision group). The Konno group demonstrated greater VTC and VTA, with all cases achieving VTC ≥4 mm and VTA ≥2 mm. In the Y-incision group, 33.0% had VTC <4 mm and 17.0% had VTA <2 mm.\nCONCLUSIONS: The Konno procedure significantly increased LVOT size and access space to the coronary ostia, reducing the risk of coronary obstruction during future ViV-TAVR. These findings suggest that the Konno procedure may provide more favorable conditions compared to the Y-incision in such cases.",Jiyoung Lee,Hiroshi Nakanaga,Nobuo Tomizawa,Yui Okada-Nozaki,Yuko Okano-Kawaguchi,Shinichiro Fujimoto,Minoru Tabata,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JTCVS techniques,2025-04-30,10.1016/j.xjtc.2025.02.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xjtc.2025.02.001,PMC11998373,Free,30,,32-42,Comparative analysis of anatomic changes and feasibility of ViV TAVR between Konno and Y incision aortic root enlargement LEE 2025,pdfs\Comparative analysis of anatomic changes and feasibility of ViV TAVR between Konno and Y incision aortic root enlargement LEE 2025.pdf,aortic valve replacement,transcatheter aortic valve,aortic valve,Konno group,Konno,aortic,Y-incision aortic root,aortic root enlargement,aortic root,Konno procedure,2025-04-30,approved,true,aortic root enlargement,surgical aortic valve replacement,transcatheter aortic valve implantation,valve-in-valve,,,,,,,

Outcomes were compared between MV repair and replacement. Primary outcomes included 30-day mortality and 1-year survival after MV surgery.\nRESULTS: Among enrolled patients (mean age 73.8 ± 10.1 years, median Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality 3.9% [Q1-Q3: 2.2%-6.8%]), 25 (7.5%) underwent repair and 307 (92.5%) underwent replacement. The replacement group had a significantly higher rate of comorbidities, including atrial fibrillation, prior cardiac surgery, more secondary mitral regurgitation, and more devices implanted at index M-TEER (P < 0.05 for all). Replacement patients showed a trend toward higher 30-day mortality (17.7% [52 of 294] vs 4.0% [1 of 25]; P = 0.094). The observed-to-expected ratio of 30-day mortality was 3.6 (95% CI: 1.9-5.3) overall, 3.8 (95% CI: 2.1-5.5) in the replacement group, and 1.7 (95% CI: 0.7-3.3) in the repair group. Replacement patients had higher 1-year mortality (33.3% [65 of 195] vs 10.5% [2 of 19]; P = 0.041). Significantly lower survival rates were observed after replacement at 2 years (P = 0.033) and persisted in the risk-adjusted Cox regression analysis (HR for replacement: 4.24; 95% CI: 1.04-17.31; P = 0.044).\nCONCLUSIONS: MV surgery after failed M-TEER is a high-risk procedure associated with higher than expected 30-day mortality, with higher mortality associated with MV replacement.

This may impact hospital stay, particularly same- or next-day discharge following the procedure.\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the timing, type and factors associated with delayed (up to 30 days) AVB in patients without procedural CDs.\nMETHODS: This was a sub-analysis of the PROMOTE trial, a prospective multicenter study including consecutive patients without prior pacemaker undergoing TAVR, and with a pre-specified strategy for managing CDs. Patients with no prior right bundle branch block and no procedural CDs were included in this study. Data on 30-day occurrence, timing of AVB and permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI) were collected in a dedicated database and analyzed overall and according to the pre-procedural electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities (either first-degree AVB or abnormal QRS).\nRESULTS: A total of 675 patients were included, 334 of which (49.5%) exhibited baseline ECG abnormalities. At 30 days, 23 patients (3.4%) had a delayed AVB, 0.6% vs. 6.3% in patients with normal and abnormal ECG pre-procedurally, respectively (p<0.001). Most (74%) delayed AVB occurred at days 1 or 2 following the procedure. In the multivariable analysis, the factors associated with an increased rate of delayed AVB were a pre-existing abnormal ECG (OR 5.28; 95%CI [1.53-18.27], p = 0.009) and a LVEF < 50% (OR 4.17; 95%CI [1.75-9.93], p =0.001). Among patients in sinusal rhythm with preprocedural abnormal ECG, those with QRS >120 ms and first-degree AVB exhibited the highest risk (PPI: 17.8%) followed by those with isolated QRS >120 ms (PPI: 8.7%).\nCONCLUSION: Among TAVR recipients with no procedural CDs, those with an abnormal ECG pre-procedurally represent a high-risk group for delayed AVB requiring PPI. This would support a tailored strategy, with a minimalist approach (same or next-day discharge) in low-risk patients, and a more prolonged hospitalization or continuous ECG ambulatory monitoring in those at higher risk.",Quentin Fischer,Luis Nombela-Franco,Guillem Muntané-Carol,Gabriela Veiga,Ander Regueiro,Tamim Nazif,Vicenç Serra,Lluis Asmarats,Henrique B Ribeiro,Azeem Latib,Anthony Poulin,Asim N Cheema,Pilar Jiménez-Quevedo,Joan Antoni Gomez-Hospital,Aritz Gil Ongay,Andrea Ruberti,Dabit Arzamendi,Michael Brener,Alvaro Calabuig,Andrea Scotti,Marco Antonio S Gelain,Marino Labinaz,Pedro Cepas,Melanie Côté,Juan H Del Portillo,François Philippon,Josep Rodés-Cabau,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Heart rhythm,2025-04-14,10.1016/j.hrthm.2025.04.017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hrthm.2025.04.017,,Paid,,,,Risk of Delayed AtrioVentricular Block in Pts Without Procedural Conduction Disturbances During TAVR FISCHER 2025,Not available,Aortic Valve Replacement,Transcatheter Aortic Valve,Procedural Conduction Disturbances,Valve Replacement,Aortic Valve,Conduction Disturbances,Transcatheter Aortic,Delayed AtrioVentricular Block,undergoing transcatheter aortic,Procedural Conduction,2025-04-30,,,conduction disturbances,left bundle branch block,permanent pacemaker,sudden cardiac death,transcatheter aortic valve implantation,,,,,,

Interventional management involved performing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty using balloon dilation on both the left main coronary artery and its ostium. Intravascular ultrasound confirmed successful dilation of the coronary ostium. The patient experienced resolution of symptoms, and ventricular premature beats disappeared on electrocardiogram monitoring. However, the patient unfortunately succumbed to sudden death one month after discharge.\nCONCLUSION: Guidewires for chronic total occlusion may be necessary for patients with severely calcified and stenotic aortic valves that are challenging to navigate. Before undertaking TAVR, precise preoperative evaluation, including accurate risk assessment, multimodal imaging, and thorough planning, is essential. While balloon dilation can provide temporary relief for coronary obstruction, it carries the risk of subsequent delayed coronary occlusion with serious consequences.

The prognostic impact of mild PVR, particularly in patients with elevated preprocedural left ventricular (LV) filling pressure, remains uncertain.\nAIMS: This study aimed to assess the influence of elevated preprocedural LV filling pressure on mild PVR prognosis following TAVR.\nMETHODS: This single-center, retrospective study analyzed consecutive patients with severe aortic stenosis who underwent TAVR, excluding those with moderate or severe PVR. Preprocedural LV filling pressure was evaluated using baseline E/A ratio, and patients were stratified into four groups based on E/A ratio (≤1 or >1) and PVR severity (none/trace or mild). The primary endpoint was cardiovascular death within 5 years.\nRESULTS: Among 904 patients, 466 had E/A ≤ 1 with none/trace PVR, 92 had E/A > 1 with none/trace PVR, 300 had E/A ≤ 1 with mild PVR, and 46 had E/A > 1 with mild PVR. Multivariable analysis identified E/A > 1 with mild PVR as an independent predictor of cardiovascular death (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 2.38; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.28-4.42; p < 0.01). In contrast, E/A > 1 with none/trace PVR (HR: 1.16, 95% CI: 0.66-2.03) and E/A ≤ 1 with mild PVR (HR: 1.33, 95% CI: 0.89-2.00) were not significant predictors compared to E/A ≤ 1 with none/trace PVR.\nCONCLUSIONS: Elevated preprocedural LV filling pressure is independently associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular death in patients with mild PVR following TAVR.",Shumpei Kosugi,Isamu Mizote,Daisuke Nakamura,Hiroki Sugae,Yutaka Matsuhiro,Shota Okuno,Ai Kawamura,Kizuku Yamashita,Koichi Maeda,Kazuo Shimamura,Tomoharu Dohi,Yasuharu Takeda,Yasushi Sakata,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,2025-04-15,10.1002/ccd.31537,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.31537,,Paid,,,,Impact of Elevated Preprocedural LV Filling Pressure on Prognosis of Mild Paravalvular Regurgitation Following TAVR KOSUGI 2025,Not available,Aortic Valve Replacement,Transcatheter Aortic Valve,Mild Paravalvular Regurgitation,Preprocedural Left Ventricular,Elevated Preprocedural Left,mild PVR,Paravalvular Regurgitation,Valve Replacement,PVR,Elevated Preprocedural,2025-04-30,,,E/A ratio,aortic stenosis,brain natriuretic peptide,left ventricular filling pressure,paravalvular regurgitation,transcatheter aortic valve replacement,,,,,

Recent iterations of the Evolut valve system are intended to reduce PVL, but the effects of oversizing with such valves on PVL are largely unknown. We aimed to assess, in a real-world contemporary setting, the impact of Evolut valve oversizing on PVL after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.\nMETHODS: This was a multicenter observational ambispective study of patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement with the Evolut PRO/PRO+/FX valves. Aortic annulus perimeter, as determined by multidetector computed tomography, was used to estimate the oversizing degree. The primary end point was the presence of PVL (mild/moderate-severe), as determined by echocardiography at hospital discharge. Secondary end points included in-hospital outcomes as defined by the Valve Academic Research Consortium-3 recommendations.\nRESULTS: A total of 762 patients were included (Evolut PRO/PRO+/FX, 55.5%/34.8%/9.7%), and the median valve oversizing was 20 (17-25)%, with no differences in baseline characteristics between low (≤20%, n=381) and high (>20%, n=381) valve oversizing recipients. In-hospital mortality and stroke rates were 2.4% and 4.3%, respectively, with no oversizing-related differences in clinical outcomes. Permanent pacemaker rates were similar in patients with low (19.4%) and high (15.8%) valve oversizing, P=0.21. PVL was found in 35.6% of patients (mild: 32.6%, moderate-severe: 3.0%), with a higher incidence of PVL in patients with low (40.9%) versus high (30.2%) oversizing, P=0.002. In a multivariable analysis, a higher oversizing degree was associated with a lower risk of PVL (odds ratio, 0.95 [0.92-0.99] for each 1% increase in oversizing, P=0.006).\nCONCLUSIONS: In transcatheter aortic valve replacement with recent Evolut valve iterations (PRO/PRO+/FX), a higher oversizing degree was associated with a lower frequency of PVL without increasing the risk of other complications (including permanent pacemaker). These data suggest that a low degree of valve oversizing should be avoided when using Evolut valves, particularly in borderline cases.",Silvia Mas-Peiro,Alberto Alperi,Ander Regueiro,Ignacio Cruz Gonzalez,Domenico Angellotti,Francisco Campelo-Parada,Marina Urena,Pablo Avanzas,Pablo Vidal-Cales,Gilles Jose Barreira de Sousa,Giovanni Esposito,Mehdi Tamir,Gaspard Suc,Anthony Poulin,Siamak Mohammadi,Marisa Avvedimento,Josep Rodés-Cabau,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Circulation.

Recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have offered new insights, prompting a reevaluation of the potential benefits of early AVR.\nMETHODS: A systematic review and pooled meta-analysis of Kaplan-Meier-derived reconstructed time-to-event data of RCTs published by November 2024 was conducted in compliance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guideline. Outcomes were derived from the primary endpoints of the included studies, with the main analysis focusing on all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and heart failure hospitalization.\nRESULTS: Four randomized controlled trials, involving 1427 patients, were included. The early AVR group demonstrated a significant reduction in all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.72, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.53-0.97, p = 0.031), cardiovascular mortality (HR = 0.56, 95 % CI 0.36-0.89, p = 0.014), and heart failure hospitalization (HR = 0.31, 95 % CI 0.18-0.53, p < 0.001). No significant interaction effects between surgical AVR and transcatheter AVR were observed.

Despite the fact that CGA includes multiple scales, comparative data among them are limited. Our aim was to evaluate the discriminative capacity of different scales used in CGA on the decision of suitability for TAVI implantation and the influence on prognosis after TAVI implantation.\nMETHODS: Single-center prospective observational study including consecutive patients with severe AS referred for TAVI implantation. A CGA was performed in all patients including scales of functionality, frailty, cognitive impairment and comorbidities. The predictive capacity of each of the scales was evaluated. The development of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE: cardiovascular mortality, heart failure [HF] and stroke) was analyzed during follow-up.\nRESULTS: A total of 142 patients were selected as candidates for TAVI (80.2%), and 121 were finally implanted. The mean age was 83±4.9 years. Patients who were candidates for TAVI had less valvular area, less atrial fibrillation (AF), less cognitive impairment, more autonomy and less frailty. The SPPB frailty and Barthel functional assessment scales were the main scales of the CGA for the TAVI candidacy decision. After TAVI implantation, 21.5% presented a MACE event, with an overall mortality of 19.8% (6.6% cardiovascular). Patients with a higher rate of events and mortality had more AF, HF, renal disease and malnutrition, as well as less family coverage.\nCONCLUSIONS: In elderly patients with severe AS, the CGA is a determining factor in the selection of candidates for TAVI, with frailty and functional assessment being the most important aspects. Family support and nutritional status have a high impact on the prognosis of patients after TAVI.",Cristina de la Rubia-Molina,Andrez Felipe Cubides-Novoa,María Teresa Madrid-López,Elisa Patín-González,Verónica Merchán-Ordoñez,Martín Negreira-Caamaño,Javier Gil-Moreno,Alfonso Freites,Ignacio Sánchez-Pérez,Virginia Mazoteras-Muñoz,Jesús Piqueras-Flores,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Medicina clinica,2025-04-12,10.1016/j.medcli.2025.106936,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medcli.2025.106936,,Paid,164,12,106936,Geriatric assessment and results of TAVI RUBIA-MOLINA 2025,Not available,transcatheter aortic valve,TAVI,TAVI implantation,aortic valve implantation,Comprehensive geriatric assessment,transcatheter aortic,aortic valve,CGA,aortic valve replacement,patients,2025-04-30,,,Aortic stenosis,Cardio-geriatrics,Cardiogeriatría,Comprehensive geriatric assessment,Estenosis aórtica,Fragilidad,Frailty,Implante transcatéter de prótesis aórtica,Transcatheter aortic valve implantation,Valoración geriátrica integral,

The untested and unproven long-term effectiveness and durability of TAVR in patients aged <70 years and the growing use of ""valve-in-valve"" for surgical aortic valve replacement bioprosthetic degeneration and TAVR failure are also highlighted. Summarizing recent observational studies, registry data, and the limited randomized evidence available, the author calls for new rigorous, long-term randomized controlled trials before broader adoption of TAVR and valve-in-valve TAVR in these populations, and urges the United States Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to align policy with evidence challenging the erosion of guideline-directed care driven by market forces.",D Craig Miller,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The Annals of thoracic surgery,2025-04-10,10.1016/j.athoracsur.2025.03.037,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.athoracsur.2025.03.037,,Paid,,,,Expanding TAVR Use in Younger Pts and Bicuspid Valves Risks Evidence Gaps and Regulatory Action MILLER 2025,Not available,Aortic Valve Replacement,Transcatheter Aortic Valve,bicuspid aortic valves,surgical aortic valve,Regulatory Action,Aortic Valve,Expanding Transcatheter Aortic,Valve Replacement,Transcatheter Aortic,valve replacement bioprosthetic,2025-04-30,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6812ead04ef6922f6d6906d0,40217961,Biomarkers of Inflammation and Association with Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Risk Stratification and Outcome in Patients with Severe Aortic Stenosis.,"Background: Inflammatory indices have been proposed as simple and routinely obtainable markers of systemic inflammation in cardiac disease. This study investigated whether the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), the monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), and the pan-immune inflammation value (PIV) serve as biomarkers for risk stratification and outcomes measures in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) following valve replacement (AVR). Methods: In this retrospective analysis (January 2017-June 2022), patients with AS underwent pre-procedural cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging and were assigned a treatment strategy by a multidisciplinary Heart Team: (1) transcatheter AVR, (2) surgical AVR, or (3) no valvular intervention. Kaplan-Meier estimates and regression analyses were used to demonstrate associations between the NLR, MLR, and PIV with myocardial fibrosis-assessed by late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and extracellular volume (ECV) on CMR-and a combined endpoint of heart failure hospitalizations and all-cause mortality. Results: A total of 356 patients (median age: 80 years, 50% male) were followed for a median of 40 months, during which 162 (46%) reached the combined endpoint. Linear regression identified C-reactive protein, but not the presence of LGE or elevated ECV, as the only independent predictor of all three inflammatory indices (p for all <0.001). After multivariable adjustment for clinical (EuroSCORE II), laboratory (baseline N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide [NT-proBNP] and C-reactive protein), and imaging parameters (AV mean pressure gradient, right ventricular ejection fraction, and ECV), the above-the-upper-quartile NLR (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 1.45, 95%-confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-1.92, p = 0.042), MLR (aHR: 1.48, 95%-CI: 1.05-2.09, p = 0.025), and PIV (aHR: 1.56, 95%-CI: 1.11-2.21, p = 0.011) remained significantly associated with adverse outcomes. Following AVR, the median NLR (3.5 to 3.4) and PIV (460 to 376) showed a significant post-procedural decline compared to baseline (p ≤ 0.019 for both). Conclusions: Inflammatory indices are readily available biomarkers independently associated with adverse outcomes in severe AS following AVR. However, no significant relationship was observed between the NLR, MLR, PIV, and myocardial fibrosis on CMR.",Matthias Koschutnik,Christina Brunner,Christian Nitsche,Carolina Donà,Varius Dannenberg,Kseniya Halavina,Sophia Koschatko,Charlotte Jantsch,Katharina Mascherbauer,Christina Kronberger,Michael Poledniczek,Caglayan Demirel,Dietrich Beitzke,Christian Loewe,Christian Hengstenberg,Andreas A Kammerlander,Philipp E Bartko,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal of clinical medicine,2025-04-07,10.3390/jcm14072512,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm14072512,PMC11990065,Free,14,7,,Biomarkers of Inflammation and Association with Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Risk Stratification and Outcome in Pts with sAS KOSCHUTNIK 2025,pdfs\Biomarkers of Inflammation and Association with Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Risk Stratification and Outcome in Pts with sAS KOSCHUTNIK 2025.pdf,Severe Aortic Stenosis,Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance,Magnetic Resonance Imaging,NLR,Aortic Stenosis,AVR,PIV,Inflammatory indices,MLR,Magnetic Resonance,2025-04-30,rejected,,CMR,aortic stenosis,leukocyte indices,outcome,systemic inflammation,,,,,,

6812ead44ef6922f6d6906d2,40215283,Impact of Dual Atrioventricular Valve Disease on Outcomes in patients undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.,"BACKGROUND: Current guidelines provide no recommendations for the management of patients with dual atrioventricular valve regurgitation (DAVR) undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), and existing data on its clinical impact remain absent.Therefore, we aimed to provide detailed insights into the impact of DAVR on outcomes after TAVR, with the potential to refine clinical risk-stratification tools and influence future management guidelines.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively analyzed 3,491 consecutive patients who underwent TAVR between 2013 and 2021. DAVR was defined as the presence of both MR and TR ≥2+. Patients were divided into four groups based on echocardiography before TAVR: no/mild atrioventricular (AV) regurgitation, isolated MR≥2+, isolated TR≥2+, and DAVR.DAVR was present in 269 patients (7.7%) and was associated with significantly reduced 3-year survival (47.3%) compared to isolated MR (64.3%), isolated TR (54.4%), and no/mild AV regurgitation (73.0%, p<0.001). Multivariate analysis identified DAVR as an independent predictor of 3-year mortality (HR 1.36, 95% CI 1.1-1.8, p=0.021). A leading TR≥3+ in DAVR patients was associated with a particularly poor prognosis (3-year survival: 27%). While an MR improvement following TAVR was linked to better survival (HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.30-0.69, p<0.001), a TR improvement had no significant impact on survival (HR: 0.69, 95%CI: 0.45-1.05, p=0.086). Notably, 54% of DAVR patients continued to experience significant exertional dyspnea at follow-up (NYHA≥II).\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the importance of recognizing DAVR as a high-risk condition in TAVR patients, highlighting the need for refined risk-stratification tools and potential adjunctive therapeutic strategies to improve outcomes.",Philipp M Doldi,Kornelia Löw,Julius Steffen,Julius Fischer,Maximilian Tischmacher,Nike Knufinke,Thomas J Stocker,Hans Theiss,Konstantinos Rizas,Konstantin Stark,Christian Hagl,Michael Näbauer,Steffen Massberg,Jörg Hausleiter,Simon Deseive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,European heart journal.

6812ead74ef6922f6d6906d3,40214963,Long-term age-stratified outcomes after surgical and transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a Dutch cohort study.,"BACKGROUND: While randomised trials have shown that surgical and transcutaneous aortic valve replacement/implantation (SAVR/TAVI) have similar short- to mid-term outcomes, long-term outcome data are scarce. Additionally, no large-scale long-term follow-up data from Dutch databases and TAVI centres have been reported to inform national guidelines.\nMETHODS: We retrospectively analysed baseline characteristics, 5‑year mortality and re-intervention rates of patients undergoing isolated SAVR or TAVI, stratified by age (65-75, 75-80 and > 80 years old) in the Netherlands Heart Registry.\nRESULTS: From 2013 through 2021, 7879 SAVR patients (median age: 73.0 years; interquartile range (IQR): 69.0-77.0; 43.7% female) and 14,461 TAVI patients (median age: 81.0 years; IQR: 77.0-84.0; 49.9% female) were treated in the Netherlands. Patients undergoing TAVI more frequently had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, dialysis, poor mobility, previous stroke, unstable angina and recent myocardial infarction compared with SAVR patients. This higher comorbidity rate in TAVI was observed across all age groups. After 5‑year follow-up, mortality rates were higher after TAVI compared with SAVR (35.5% vs 13.0%; p < 0.001). This difference decreased with increasing age (p for interaction < 0.001). While the aortic re-intervention rate was low in both cohorts, it was higher after SAVR than TAVI (1.9% vs 0.9%; p < 0.001).\nCONCLUSION: Demographics of patients undergoing SAVR versus TAVI in the Netherlands differed substantially. TAVI patients were older and had more comorbidities than SAVR patients, across all age groups. Mortality rates were highest after TAVI, while aortic re-intervention was more common after SAVR. These findings reflect differences in baseline patient characteristics and current daily practice in decision-making by the Heart Teams.",Kees van Bergeijk,Stijn Venema,Ad van den Heuvel,Rik van der Werf,Wobbe Bouma,Yvonne Douglas,Niki Medendorp,Marijke Timmermans,Adriaan Voors,Joanna J Wykrzykowska,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Netherlands heart journal : monthly journal of the Netherlands Society of Cardiology and the Netherlands Heart Foundation,2025-05-02,10.1007/s12471-025-01944-5,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12471-025-01944-5,PMC12014882,Free,33,5,172-179,Long term age stratified outcomes after surgical and TAVR a Dutch cohort study BERGEIJK 2025,pdfs\Long term age stratified outcomes after surgical and TAVR a Dutch cohort study BERGEIJK 2025.pdf,TAVI,SAVR,Netherlands Heart Registry,SAVR patients,SAVR versus TAVI,TAVI patients,Netherlands,Netherlands Heart,patients,Heart Registry,2025-05-02,approved,true,Comorbidities,Long-term outcomes,SAVR,TAVI,,,,,,,

Intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) is a novel technology that fractures intimal/medial calcium, increasing vessel compliance and enabling TF-TAVR in selected patients with peripheral artery disease.\nCASE SUMMARY: A 76-year-old female presented with severe degenerative calcific aortic valvular stenosis. The patient was planned for TAVR due to high surgical risk status. However, computed tomography analysis revealed significant aortoiliac calcific narrowing, which limited TF access. Intravascular lithotripsy was performed to modify the calcific stenosis in the aortoiliac region, after which TAVR was successfully completed via the transfemoral route. This intervention was crucial in allowing TAVR to be performed at a low risk. The procedure was successful, and the patient was doing well at 8-month follow-up.\nDISCUSSION: Peripheral IVL appears to be a safe and effective solution for TAVR candidates with co-existing iliofemoral calcifications. Using peripheral IVL to facilitate TF access should be part of the TAVR algorithm, to maintain the safety profile and superior outcomes of traditional TF-TAVR. More research is needed to improve the understanding of anatomical selection for IVL in TAVR candidates. Operators performing IVL-assisted TF-TAVR should be familiar with endovascular interventions and bailout solutions, not so much to treat IVL-treated lesions, but to be able to treat any vascular complication that may occur at the puncture site.",Vaibhav J Bhastana,Swaroop Bharadi,Rajeev Menon,Anuj Kapadiya,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,European heart journal.

6812eadb4ef6922f6d6906d7,40204013,Vascular Complications in Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement With Contemporary Devices.,"BACKGROUND: Vascular complications (VCs) remain a major concern after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). However, their occurrence in patients treated with newer generation devices has been scarcely studied. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the incidence, management, predictors, and clinical impact of VCs in patients undergoing TAVR with contemporary devices.\nMETHODS: Our multicenter study included 8815 patients undergoing transfemoral TAVR. VCs were classified based on the Valve Academic Research Consortium-3 criteria. Baseline, procedural, and follow-up data were prospectively collected in a dedicated database.\nRESULTS: VCs occurred in 1464 patients (16.5%), being major in 44.7% and minor in 55.3% of cases, most of these being related to primary access (87%). Among these, vascular injury (∼ 75%) and device closure failure (∼ 25%) were the most predominant subtypes. Major VCs were independently associated with a substantial increase in 1-year mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 2.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.09-3.14, P < 0.001). However, this association was absent in minor VCs, even if an unplanned intervention occurred. Female sex, dual-antiplatelet therapy, access-related anatomic factors, and use of large plug-based vascular closure were associated with an increased risk of major VCs (P < 0.05 for all), with echocardiography-guided access and secondary radial access emerging as protective factors (P < 0.01 for all).\nCONCLUSIONS: VC persists as a major issue in patients undergoing TAVR with contemporary devices, with multiple modifiable factors determining a higher risk. Major, but not minor, VCs were associated with poorer short- and long-term survival. Given their negative impact on clinical outcomes, every effort should be made to minimize the occurrence of VCs after TAVR.",Pedro Cepas-Guillén,Marisa Avvedimento,Julien Ternacle,Marina Urena,Alberto Alperi,Asim Cheema,Gabriela Veiga-Fernandez,Luis Nombela-Franco,Victoria Vilalta,Giovanni Esposito,Ciro Indolfi,Maria Del Trigo,Antonio Muñoz-Garcia,Nicolas Maneiro,Lluis Asmarats,Ander Regueiro,David Del Val,Vicenç Serra,Ariana Gonzálvez-García,Guillaume Bonnet,Antonio Di Renzo,Jules Mesnier,Suc Gaspard,Pablo Avanzas,Effat Rezaei,Victor Fradejas-Sastre,Jorge F Chavez Solsol,Eduard Fernández-Nofrerias,Domenico Angellotti,Sabato Sorrentino,Juan Francisco Oteo,Felipe Diez-Delhoyo,Lola Gutiérrez-Alonso,Andrea Ruberti,Fernando Alfonso,Andrea Monastyrski,Emilie Pelletier-Beaumont,Josep Rodés-Cabau,,,,,,,,,,,,,The Canadian journal of cardiology,2025-04-09,10.1016/j.cjca.2025.03.034,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2025.03.034,,Paid,,,,Vascular Complications in Pts Undergoing TAVR With Contemporary Devices CEPAS-GUILLÉN 2025,Not available,Transcatheter Aortic Valve,Aortic Valve Replacement,Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic,patients undergoing TAVR,Transcatheter Aortic,Aortic Valve,Valve Replacement,Patients Undergoing Transcatheter,Patients Undergoing,Valve Academic Research,2025-04-30,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6812eadb4ef6922f6d6906d8,40203735,Effects of different valve-in-valve positions on the hydrodynamic properties of transcatheter aortic valves.,"OBJECTIVE: With the rise of transcatheter aortic valve-in-valve (ViV) procedures for high-risk patients with degenerated surgical aortic valves, precise positioning of the transcatheter heart valve (THV) within the surgical heart valve (SHV) is crucial for optimal functional outcomes. This study aims to explore the impact of implantation depth on functional outcomes post-ViV in a controlled in vitro setting.\nMETHODS: This study focused on the impact of valve positioning on fluid dynamics characteristics and subsequent ViV procedural outcomes. Rigorous in vitro experiments measured the structural parameters of the surgical valves, and based on these, the appropriate Taurus Elite valves were selected for pulse flow testing under simulated conditions of varying heart rates and cardiac outputs. Fluid dynamic evaluations were conducted on Taurus Elite THVs in sizes 21, 23, 26, 29 mm and SHVs from two brands: Hancock II (Medtronic, USA) and BalMedic (Balance Medical, China) across a range of diameters. In-depth analysis was performed at a cardiac output (CO) of 5 L/min and heart rate (HR) of 70 bpm, focusing on key metrics such as transvalvular pressure gradient (TVPG), effective orifice area (EOA), and total regurgitation fraction (TRF) at implantation depths of -2.5, 0, 2.5, and 5 mm to gain insights into the dynamic interaction between THV placement and hemodynamic performance. Anchoring force tests were also conducted for SHV-THV combinations at -2.5 and 0 mm depths to ensure safety of implantation.\nRESULTS: Significant differences were observed in TVPG, EOA, and TRF across various SHV brands and sizes, emphasizing the importance of THV positioning. Specifically, Taurus Elite23 demonstrated superior TVPG performance at various depths compared to Taurus Elite21, indicating a better match with BalMedic19 and Hancock II21, especially at implantation depths ranging from -2.5 to 0 mm. Taurus Elite29 showed the lowest TVPG across all tested depths, making it the preferred choice for BalMedic25 and Hancock II27. These findings highlight the importance of selecting the appropriate THV model and determining the optimal implantation depth for different SHVs.\nCONCLUSIONS: In different surgical valves, both the model and implantation depth of the interventional valve can affect its hemodynamic performance and valve opening-closing morphology. The recommended implantation of the interventional valve as shallowly as possible in this study has guiding significance in clinical valve-in-valve surgeries.",Hong Fang,Shi Su,Liang Zhang,Shuchun Li,Kun Zhang,Kejing Yi,Mengxiao Shi,Nan Wang,Qing Zhou,Min Jin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Computers in biology and medicine,2025-06-30,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2025.110106,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2025.110106,,Paid,191,,110106,Effects of different ViV positions on the hydrodynamic properties of transcatheter aortic valves FANG 2025,Not available,transcatheter aortic valves,transcatheter aortic,Taurus Elite THVs,Taurus Elite valves,aortic valves,surgical aortic valves,transcatheter heart valve,Taurus Elite,hydrodynamic properties,implantation,2025-04-30,approved,,Aortic valve bioprosthesis,Aortic valve replacement,Valve-in-valve,,,,,,,,

Non-invasive modalities can aid in the diagnosis for timely treatment.\nMETHODS: In this retrospective, single-center study of patients with aortic stenosis who underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), we calculated stroke volume using CT blood pool based (CT-blp) analysis, echocardiogram and right heart catheterization (cath) performed before TAVR. We compared the performance of each modality in predicting 30-day and 1-year outcomes.\nRESULTS: Three-hundred and forty-five patients were included with a median age of 84 (79-88) years and 52.8% females. CT-blp correlated more strongly (r = 0.60) with cath-derived stroke volume than echo (r = 0.37). After stratifying patients into groups based on flow and gradient using echo or CT-blp, there was no difference in mortality with either modality among the groups. However, the composite of mortality and hospital readmission was significantly higher in the low-flow low-gradient group (CT-blp 30-day OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.3-5.3, p < 0.01; 1-year OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.0-3.6; p = 0.04) compared to patients with normal flow high gradients when grouping was performed with CT-blp or echo.\nCONCLUSION: Using the CT performed on patients pre-TAVR, CT-blp can provide an estimation of stroke volume that correlates well with invasive evaluation. The stroke volume may be used to stratify patient populations being evaluated for TAVR into flow gradient groups when echo is limited and avoid invasive catheterization to help identify patients with low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis.

6812eade4ef6922f6d6906da,40199635,Comparison of dual-energy iodine and standard subtraction methods for myocardial extracellular volume quantification using cardiac computed tomography.,"BACKGROUND: Computed tomography (CT)-derived extracellular volume fraction (ECV) quantifies myocardial fibrosis noninvasively, comparable to cardiovascular magnetic resonance. The conventional subtraction method (ECV-conv) requires dedicated pre- and post-contrast acquisitions, while the dual-energy spectral method (ECV-spec) uses only the post-contrast phase. We aimed to compare these methods in patients undergoing CT planning for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).\nMETHODS: We prospectively included patients undergoing CT-TAVR evaluation on a dual-energy dual-layer detector scanner. Baseline pre-contrast and equilibrium delay phase (at 5 ​min) prospectively ECG-triggered acquisitions were co-registered for ECV-conv calculation. Equilibrium phase spectral iodine maps were derived for ECV-spec measurement and compared with ECV-con maps using a mid-septal and a global mid-ventricular region of interest.\nRESULTS: Overall, 78 patients (53 ​% female, mean age 77 years) were analyzed. There was a minor overestimation in global measurement by ECV-spec (31.8 ​± ​4.6 ​% vs 30.3 ​± ​5.3 ​%, p ​= ​0.023. However, there were no significant differences between both methods for the mid-septal measurement (ECV-conv ​= ​30.4 ​± ​5.3 ​% vs ECV-spec ​= ​31.0 ​± ​5.6 ​%, p ​= ​0.196).). Both methods demonstrated comparable 95 ​% limits of agreement, with a strong correlation for mid-septal (r ​= ​0.75, p ​< ​0.0001) and a moderate correlation for global measurements (r ​= ​0.51, p ​< ​0.0001).\nCONCLUSIONS: Myocardial CT-ECV estimation using dual-energy spectral maps was comparable to the conventional subtraction method without the need of a pre-contrast acquisition.

Specifically, this year saw the release of many in-depth reports comparing the long-term outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) vs surgical approaches for aortic valve replacement, data which is expected to move the transcatheter pendulum. In particular, this included a national analysis of trends reporting the rapid increase of post-TAVR surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). This year's literature also reported ground-breaking milestones related robotics in cardiothoracic surgery, with publication of the first multicenter series of robotic aortic valve replacements, the first entirely robotic double lung and heart transplants, as well as the first combined robotic aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting. Specific to lung cancer, data continues to emerge regarding the de-escalation of magnitude of surgical resection from lobectomy to sublobar when able, and in the benefit of immunotherapy in the neoadjuvant treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. Frequent in the literature this year were concerns about toxicity, surgical challenges after therapy, and potential increases in perioperative complications following neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy, with calls for surgeons to crucially assess these effects on surgical outcomes to help refine patient selection criteria. Finally, 2024 saw many advancements in intraoperative tumor localization focused on enhancing precision, minimizing invasiveness, and improving surgical outcomes, including robotic-assisted bronchoscopy, electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB), and encouraging data regarding intraoperative molecular imaging.",Christina M Stuart,Robert A Meguid,Jessica Y Rove,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Seminars in cardiothoracic and vascular anesthesia,2025-04-08,10.1177/10892532251332455,https://doi.org/10.1177/10892532251332455,,Paid,,,10892532251332455,Noteworthy in Cardiothoracic Surgery 2024 STUART 2025,Not available,Cardiothoracic Surgery,aortic valve replacement,Noteworthy in Cardiothoracic,aortic valve,valve replacement,robotic aortic valve,Cardiothoracic,Surgery,valve,surgical aortic valve,2025-04-30,,,aortic valve replacement,cardiac surgery,minimally invasive surgery,robotics,thoracic surgery,,,,,,
6812eadf4ef6922f6d6906dc,40195614,Emergent Cardiac Surgery After Transcatheter Structural Heart Procedures: Narrative Review.,"Transcatheter structural heart procedures have become standard therapy for elderly patients with high surgical risk. Over time, these procedures have significantly increased worldwide, accompanied by a concomitant reduction of major complications, including those requiring emergent cardiac surgery (ECS). This marked decline in ECS is due to technological advancements, improved patient selection and procedural techniques, and increased institutional and operators expertize. Moreover, most major structural complications after transcatheter structural heart procedures are now managed percutaneously, with only a small proportion requiring ECS. It is important to note that outcomes for patients requiring ECS remain unfavorable, even in the optimal setting. Currently, ECS after percutaneous structural interventions is very rare, less than 0.5%, as reported in multicenter available studies. However, fragmented data exist in the literature on the need of ECS. Indeed, low incidence, different definitions, and lack of recent reports make it difficult to have a precise and up-to-date overview of bailout surgery for treatment of procedural complications. This is the first comprehensive analysis focusing on ECS following the major frequent percutaneous structural procedures, that is, transcatheter aortic valve replacement, mitral valve repair/replacement, and left atrial appendage occlusion. More in general, a collaborative approach among Heart Team members, along with thorough procedural planning guided by advanced imaging techniques, is essential for ensuring high-quality interventions thus minimizing the risk of adverse events.",Miriam Compagnone,Gianni Dall'Ara,Simone Grotti,Daniela Spartà,Giuseppe Guerrieri,Carmine Pizzi,Fabio Felice Tarantino,Marcello Galvani,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,2025-04-07,10.1002/ccd.31519,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.31519,,Paid,,,,Emergent Cardiac Surgery After Transcatheter Structural Heart Procedures Narrative Review COMPAGNONE 2025,Not available,Narrative Review,Transcatheter Structural Heart,Structural Heart Procedures,Emergent Cardiac Surgery,Heart Procedures,Structural Heart,Cardiac Surgery,ECS,Emergent Cardiac,Transcatheter Structural,2025-04-30,,,emergent cardiac surgery,left atrial appendage occlusion,transcatheter aortic valve replacement,transcatheter edge‐to‐edge repair,,,,,,,

Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) has emerged as an effective treatment option, especially for patients at high surgical risk. However, the variation in post-TAVR quality of life across patient groups warrants further examination to understand the contributing factors.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the quality of life in patients post-TAVR, characterize distinct patient group profiles, and identify key factors that influence their quality of life.\nMETHODS: From July 2023 to September 2024, 215 TAVR patients were recruited via convenience sampling. Data on sociodemographics and quality of life were gathered using the TAVR-specific quality of life scale. Latent variable growth modeling helped identify quality of life categories and predict influencing factors.\nRESULTS: Three categories of TAVR patients were identified based on quality of life: the ""High quality of life-high health status"" group, the ""Medium quality of life-intermediate health"" group, and the ""Low quality of life-low health status"" group. Logistic regression analysis revealed that sleep quality, self-efficacy, and performance on the 30-s chair sit-to-stand test were significant predictors of quality of life.\nCONCLUSION: There is considerable variability in the quality of life among TAVR patients.

When new transcatheter heart valve (THV) platforms for TAVI are launched, they should be compared with best-in-practice contemporary THVs for their short-term and long-term performance. The COMPARE-TAVI 1 trial was designed to provide a head-to-head comparison of the SAPIEN 3 or SAPIEN 3 Ultra THVs and the Myval or Myval Octacor THVs.\nMETHODS: This multicentre, all-comers, randomised, non-inferiority trial was done at three university hospitals in Denmark. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, scheduled for transfemoral TAVI, and eligible for treatment with SAPIEN 3 THVs or Myval THVs. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to treatment with SAPIEN 3 (29 mm diameter) or SAPIEN 3 Ultra (20 mm, 23 mm, or 26 mm diameter) THVs or Myval or Myval Octacor THVs (20-32 mm diameter). The TAVI procedure was performed according to local practice and under local anaesthesia unless leaflet laceration was performed. The primary endpoint was a composite of death, stroke, moderate or severe aortic regurgitation, or moderate or severe haemodynamic THV deterioration at 1 year according to Third Valve Academic Research Consortium criteria. All patients assigned to THV treatment were included in the intention-to-treat analysis, and all patients who were treated as randomly assigned were included in the per-protocol analysis. With an expected event rate of 13%, the prespecified non-inferiority margin was 5·3%. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04443023, and is closed to accrual.\nFINDINGS: Between June 15, 2020, and Nov 3, 2023, 1031 patients were enrolled. Enrolment was paused twice because of patent-related legal proceedings. Of 1031 patients, 517 patients were randomly assigned to SAPIEN 3 THVs and 514 to Myval THVs. The median patient age was 81·6 years (IQR 77·6-85·0), and 415 (40%) of 1031 patients were female and 616 (60%) were male. The primary endpoint occurred in 67 (13%) of 517 patients randomly assigned to SAPIEN 3 THVs versus 71 (14%) of 514 patients randomly assigned to Myval THVs (risk difference -0·9% [one-sided upper 95% CI 4·4%]; pnon-inferiority=0·019).\nINTERPRETATION: Myval THVs were non-inferior to SAPIEN 3 THVs in terms of a 1-year composite endpoint of death, stroke, moderate or severe aortic regurgitation, or moderate or severe haemodynamic THV deterioration.\nFUNDING: Meril Life Sciences, Vingmed Denmark, the Danish Heart Foundation, and the Central Denmark Region.",Christian Juhl Terkelsen,Philip Freeman,Jordi Sanchez Dahl,Troels Thim,Bjarne Linde Nørgaard,Nils Sofus Borg Mogensen,Mariann Tang,Ashkan Eftekhari,Jonas Agerlund Povlsen,Steen Hvitfeldt Poulsen,Lars Pedersen,Jakob Hjort,Julia Ellert,Evald Høj Christiansen,Henrik Toft Sørensen,Henrik Nissen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Lancet (London, England)",2025-04-19,10.1016/S0140-6736(25)00106-0,https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(25)00106-0,,Paid,405,10487,1362-1372,S3 versus Myval transcatheter heart valves for TAVI COMPARE TAVI 1 a multicentre randomised non inferiority trial TERKELSEN 2025,Not available,Myval Octacor THVs,SAPIEN,Myval transcatheter heart,Myval THVs,transcatheter aortic valve,Myval,aortic valve implantation,THVs,transcatheter heart valves,Myval Octacor,2025-04-30,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Infective endocarditis, most often caused by enterococci, is a significant post-procedural complication. Cefazolin has been the most frequently utilized agent for TAVI procedural prophylaxis, although recent guidelines suggest addition of an agent with enterococcal activity. Optimizing antimicrobial prophylaxis is important but little is known about antibiotic pharmacokinetics (PK) in this procedure.\nOBJECTIVES: To define the population PK profile of prophylactic cefazolin in TAVI procedures and determine appropriateness for use.\nMETHODS: Adult patients receiving cefazolin prophylaxis for TAVI were enrolled. Serum was collected at four timepoints periprocedurally for analysis of cefazolin concentrations. Population PK analysis and Monte Carlo simulation was performed. Fractional target attainment (FTA) against MIC distributions for common pathogens was performed.\nRESULTS: Three hundred and fifty-nine plasma cefazolin concentrations (188 total, 171 unbound) from 50 participants were used for model development. PTA for a 2 g dose of cefazolin and a procedure of 2 h duration was >90% for organisms with an MIC up to 8 mg/L. FTA was 100% for MSSA at all examined procedure durations and estimated glomerular filtration rate levels. FTAs for Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis, based on limited MIC data, were predominantly subthreshold.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study found a 2 g dose of cefazolin achieved target exposure for MSSA but was subthreshold for other pathogens.",C Robson,X Liu,O Al-Mukhtar,S C Wallis,H Won,J Ordonez,R Gooley,R L Stuart,S J Nicholls,J A Roberts,B A Rogers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy,2025-04-03,10.1093/jac/dkaf108,https://doi.org/10.1093/jac/dkaf108,,Paid,,,,Population pharmacokinetics and optimized prophylaxis dosing of cefazolin during TAVI ROBSON 2025,Not available,transcatheter aortic valve,aortic valve implantation,transcatheter aortic,optimized prophylaxis dosing,valve implantation,aortic valve,cefazolin,TAVI,surgical valve replacement,aortic,2025-04-30,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the definite mechanisms underlying the hypercoagulation state remain unclear to date. Our objectives were to explore whether and how neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) play a procoagulant role in patients after TAVR alone or TAVR with percutaneous coronary intervention within 1 year and further to evaluate their interactions with platelets and endothelial cells.\nMETHODS: The levels of plasma NETs, platelets, and endothelial cell activation markers were analyzed by ELISA. NET formation was observed by immunofluorescence. Procoagulant activity was measured by clotting time, fibrin, and TAT (thrombin-antithrombin) complex generation assays. Phosphatidylserine exposure on cells was assessed by flow cytometry.\nRESULTS: Compared with pre-TAVR, controls, or severe aortic stenosis without TAVR patients, the plasma NET levels in patients after TAVR alone, especially TAVR with percutaneous coronary intervention, increased from 7 days, peaking at 3 months, and then gradually decreased until the 12th month. Furthermore, neutrophils and plasma from patients post-TAVR are more prone to promote NET formation; NETs from these patients markedly decreased clotting time and increased fibrin and TAT generation. Additionally, a high concentration of NETs induced platelet aggregation and exerted a strong cytotoxic effect on endothelial cells and transformed them into a procoagulant phenotype.\nCONCLUSIONS: These results lead us to believe that NETs contribute to the hypercoagulability in patients post-TAVR. Our study may provide a new target for preventing thrombotic complications in patients post-TAVR by blocking NET generation.",Wei Wu,Dongxia Tong,Wei Xia,Bin Song,Guangwen Li,Lihui Zhou,Fangyu Xie,Chunquan Zhang,Yvhao Liu,Haiyang Wang,Zhaona Du,Yibing Shao,Jihe Li,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",2025-04-03,10.1161/ATVBAHA.124.322376,https://doi.org/10.1161/ATVBAHA.124.322376,,Paid,,,,Procoagulant Effect of Neutrophil Extracellular Traps Activated Platelets and Endothelial Cells in Pts After TAVR WU 2025,Not available,Neutrophil Extracellular Traps,TAVR,Activated Platelets,Extracellular Traps,Patients,Endothelial Cells,Neutrophil Extracellular,Activated,TAVR patients,Endothelial,2025-04-30,,,aortic valve stenosis,flow cytometry,percutaneous coronary intervention,thrombophilia,thrombosis,,,,,,

Outcomes (mortality, stroke, new pacemaker, and ""alive and well,"" defined as alive at 1 year with Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire score ≥60 and ≤10-point decrease from baseline) at 30 days and 1 year were assessed. Multivariable models were developed to assess predictors of death and stroke within 1 year after TAVR.\nRESULTS: Among 383 030 patients who underwent TAVR during the study period, 108 407 (28%) were designated low-risk by the heart team, and 68 194 (18%) met other study inclusion and exclusion criteria. Of these, 62% (n=42 093) would have been eligible for the low-risk trials. In the overall heart team-designated low-risk population, 30-day outcomes included 0.8% mortality, 1.5% stroke, and 8.4% new permanent pacemaker requirement; 1-year outcomes included 4.6% mortality, 2.6% stroke, and 90% alive and well. In the trial-eligible population, 0.6% mortality, 1.4% stroke, and 8.0% new permanent pacemaker requirement had occurred by 30 days; values at 1 year included 3.1% mortality, 2.4% stroke, and 92% alive and well. Notable multivariable predictors of 1-year mortality were atrial fibrillation, nontransfemoral access, and lower baseline Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire score.\nCONCLUSIONS: One-year outcomes among real-world trial-eligible patients are excellent, but adverse events are higher compared with published clinical trial data, likely because of greater comorbidity burden and lower baseline Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire score.

Aim of this single-center retrospective study was to evaluate strategies for minimizing periprocedural access complications as part of an interdisciplinary structural heart program.\nMETHODS: Included were all patients who underwent TAVI between 09/2022 and 08/2023 at our institution. All procedures were performed by a heart team, consisting of a cardiovascular surgeon with peripheral vascular and interventional experience and an interventional cardiologist on site. Valvular type and size, access route and backup strategies were assessed by the heart team according to the preoperative CT-imaging. Baseline characteristics, periprocedural data, complications and 30-day outcomes were analyzed concerning the access route using Mann-Whitney-U-test or Fisher´s exact test.\nRESULTS: Analyzed were 167 consecutive patients (81 (76-85) years; 53.3% male). 48 (28.7%) of these had severe peripheral artery disease. 130 (77.8%) procedures were performed via a percutaneous transfemoral approach, 13 (7.8%) via a femoral cut-down and 4 (2.4%) via a transaxillary access. For 20 procedures (11.9%) a transapical access was used. 106 patients (72%) with transvascular and all patients with transapical access received a balloon-expanding valve, whereas 41 (28%) patients with transvascular access received a self-expanding prosthesis. No coronary occlusion was seen. Annular rupture occurred in one patient (0.6%), valve displacement in two patients (1.2%).

6812eae94ef6922f6d6906e4,40175757,Millimetre-scale bioresorbable optoelectronic systems for electrotherapy.,"Temporary pacemakers are essential for the care of patients with short-lived bradycardia in post-operative and other settings1-4. Conventional devices require invasive open-heart surgery or less invasive endovascular surgery, both of which are challenging for paediatric and adult patients5-8. Other complications9-11 include risks of infections, lacerations and perforations of the myocardium, and of displacements of external power supplies and control systems. Here we introduce a millimetre-scale bioresorbable optoelectronic system with an onboard power supply and a wireless, optical control mechanism with generalized capabilities in electrotherapy and specific application opportunities in temporary cardiac pacing. The extremely small sizes of these devices enable minimally invasive implantation, including percutaneous injection and endovascular delivery. Experimental studies demonstrate effective pacing in mouse, rat, porcine, canine and human cardiac models at both single-site and multi-site locations. Pairing with a skin-interfaced wireless device allows autonomous, closed-loop operation upon detection of arrhythmias. Further work illustrates opportunities in combining these miniaturized devices with other medical implants, with an example of arrays of pacemakers for individual or collective use on the frames of transcatheter aortic valve replacement systems, to provide unique solutions that address risks for atrioventricular block following surgeries.

The primary endpoint was the incidence of BVD through 5 years from the RCTs. The association of BVD with 5-year clinical outcomes was evaluated in the pooled RCT and non-RCT populations.\nRESULTS: Of 5,606 patients evaluated, 3,070 (54.8%) were men, and the mean age was 82.2 ± 7.4 years. A total of 2,344 RCT patients, including 1,227 who received TAVR and 1,117 who received surgery, and 3,262 non-RCT TAVR patients were included. The rate of BVD was lower in RCT patients undergoing CoreValve/Evolut TAVR compared with surgery (9.7% vs 15.3%; subdistribution HR: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.45-0.73; P < 0.001). In the pooled RCT and non-RCT cohort, BVD was associated with increased 5-year all-cause mortality (HR: 1.49; 95% CI: 1.32-1.68; P < 0.001), cardiovascular mortality (HR: 1.76; 95% CI: 1.52-2.03; P < 0.001), and hospitalization for valve disease or worsening heart failure (HR: 1.48; 95% CI: 1.23-1.78; P < 0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: Five-year valve performance was significantly better after CoreValve/Evolut TAVR compared with surgery. Development of BVD in TAVR and surgery patients was associated with worsened 5-year clinical outcomes.

The Venus-PowerX Valve is a novel self-expanding dry-tissue TAVR device which is retrievable at 100% full deployment. This first-in-man study sought to evaluate the feasibility and safety of the new TAVR device. The clinical outcomes and adverse events were assessed and reported according to the Valve Academic Research Consortium-3 criteria. A total of 25 patients with severe aortic stenosis (75.3 ± 5.3 years, 48.0% male, 52.0% bicuspid aortic valve) were enrolled. Acute technical success was achieved in 25 (100%) patients. Valve recapture at 100% full deployment was attempted in 2 patients due to suboptimal position or inappropriate valve size, and was successful in both. No patient required a second valve. At 30 days, device success was achieved in 88.0%. The reasons for unachieved device success included residual gradient (4.0%), moderate paravalvular leak (PVL, 4.0%) and VARC type 2 bleeding (4.0%). New permanent pacemaker was required in 5 (20.0%) patients. At 1-year follow-up, overall survival rate was 96.0%, there was no stroke, myocardial infarction, or cardiovascular rehospitalization. Mean aortic valve gradient improved significantly from 56.0 ± 17.9 mmHg to 11.6 ± 6.0 mmHg, and effective orifice area improved from 0.6 ± 0.2 cm2 to 1.8 ± 0.4 cm2; 79.1% had none or trivial PVL. In conclusion, the novel fully retrievable Venus-PowerX Valve could enable highly predictable TAVR device positioning and produce satisfactory hemodynamic and clinical outcomes in both bicuspid and tricuspid aortic valve stenosis.",Zhengang Zhao,Yong Peng,Fei Chen,Esteban Villegas,Adolfo Lopez Campanher,Zhongkai Zhu,Xi Li,Xin Wei,Jiafu Wei,Scott Lim,Jorge Baccaro,Yuan Feng,Mao Chen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The American journal of cardiology,2025-03-31,10.1016/j.amjcard.2025.03.032,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjcard.2025.03.032,,Paid,247,,29-34,TAVR With a Fully Retrievable Self Expanding Dry Tissue Valve First in Man Study ZHAO 2025,Not available,Aortic Valve Replacement,Transcatheter Aortic Valve,Valve,Aortic Valve,Valve Replacement,TAVR device,self-expanding dry-tissue TAVR,dry-tissue TAVR device,self-expanding transcatheter aortic,TAVR,2025-04-30,,,TAVR,aortic stenosis,dry tissue,fully retrievable,,,,,,,

This meta-analysis aims to investigate whether early intervention can lead to improved clinical outcomes compared with conservative management in asymptomatic severe AS. We conducted a literature search of major databases to identify randomized controlled trials that compared an early intervention (either early surgical aortic valve replacement or early transcatheter aortic valve replacement) with conservative management in patients with asymptomatic severe AS. Data for clinical outcomes were extracted, and risk ratios (RRs) were calculated for all end points with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The meta-analysis included 4 randomized controlled trials with 1427 patients. Compared with conservative management, early intervention was associated with no significant difference in all-cause [RR, 0.52 (95% CI, 0.23-1.19)] or cardiovascular death [RR, 0.41 (95% CI, 0.10-1.64)]. A statistically significant reduction was observed in the risk of stroke [RR, 0.60 (95% CI, 0.38-0.94)] and unplanned hospitalizations [RR, 0.49 (95% CI, 0.40-0.60)] with an early intervention. The risk of myocardial infarction remained comparable [RR, 0.67 (95% CI, 0.13-3.54)].

The Randomized researcH in womEn all comers wIth Aortic stenosis (RHEIA) trial investigates the balance of benefits and risks of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) vs. surgery in women.\nMETHODS: Women were randomized 1:1 to transfemoral TAVI with a balloon-expandable valve or surgery. The primary composite endpoint was death, stroke, or (valve, procedure or heart failure related) rehospitalization at 1 year. Non-inferiority testing with a pre-specified 6% margin and superiority testing were performed in the as-treated population.\nRESULTS: At 48 European centres, 443 women underwent randomization, and 420 were treated as randomized. Mean age was 73 years, and the mean estimated surgical risk of death was 2.1% (Society of Thoracic Surgeons risk score). Kaplan-Meier estimates of the primary endpoint event rates at 1 year were 8.9% in the TAVI and 15.6% in the surgery group. This difference of -6.8% with an upper 95% confidence limit of -1.5% demonstrated the non-inferiority of TAVI (P < .001). The two-sided 95% confidence interval of -13.0% to -.5% further resulted in superiority (P = .034). The 1-year incidence of the primary endpoint components was: .9% with TAVI vs. 2.0% with surgery for death from any cause, 3.3% vs. 3.0% for stroke, and 5.8% vs. 11.4% for rehospitalization.\nCONCLUSIONS: Among women with severe aortic stenosis, the incidence of the composite of death, stroke, or rehospitalization at 1 year was lower with TAVI than with surgery.\nCLINICALTRIALS.GOV NUMBER: NCT04160130.",Didier Tchetche,Philippe Pibarot,Jeroen J Bax,Nikolaos Bonaros,Stephan Windecker,Nicolas Dumonteil,Fabian Nietlispach,David Messika-Zeitoun,Stuart J Pocock,Pierre Berthoumieu,Martin J Swaans,Leo Timmers,Tanja Katharina Rudolph,Sabine Bleiziffer,Lionel Leroux,Thomas Modine,Frank van der Kley,Vincent Auffret,Jacques Tomasi,Lukas Stastny,Christian Hengstenberg,Martin Andreas,Florence Leclercq,Thomas Gandet,Julia Mascherbauer,Karola Trescher,Bernard Prendergast,Mariuca Vasa-Nicotera,Alaide Chieffo,Jan Mares,Wilbert Wesselink,Radka Rakova,Jana Kurucova,Peter Bramlage,Helene Eltchaninoff,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,European heart journal,2025-04-02,10.1093/eurheartj/ehaf133,https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehaf133,,Paid,,,,Transcatheter vs SAVR in women the RHEIA trial TCHETCHE 2025,Not available,aortic valve replacement,aortic stenosis,surgical aortic valve,surgical valve replacement,BACKGROUND AND AIMS,women,transcatheter aortic valve,aortic valve,TAVI,aortic,2025-04-30,,,Aortic stenosis,SAVR,TAVI,Women,,,,,,,

Commissural alignment between the prosthesis and the native valve was measured by TEE by two independent cardiologists using a standardized 3-cusp view pre and post-valve deployment. CMA was defined as a neocommissure deviation > 30° compared with native commissures. Echocardiographic gradients and clinical events were recorded during follow-up and compared between groups.\nRESULTS: One hundred and five patients (54% male, mean age 80.4 years) were included; 63 (40%) were classified as ""aligned"" (CMA < 30°) and 42 (60%) as ""misaligned"" (CMA > 30°). Patients with CMA > 30° presented smaller aortic annulus (23.8 vs. 20.7, p < 0.01) and received smaller valves. There was a slight increase of mean transvalvular gradient during follow-up (9.2-10.3 mmHg, p < 0.05), without significant differences between groups. Mortality rate was 16.2% at 1 year and 49.5% at 5 years; and not related to commissural alignment.\nCONCLUSIONS: Significant CMA is present in 40% of patients treated with SAPIEN 3 valves, however, we didn't find a significant association between CMA and gradient increase or mortality during long-term follow-up.",Leire Unzue,Belén Díaz Antón,Adrián Peláez Laderas,Lorena Martín Polo,Jose María Castellano Vázquez,Francisco José Rodríguez Rodrigo,Francisco Javier Parra Jimenez,Leticia Fernández-Friera,Rodrigo Teijeiro Mestre,Eulogio García Fernández,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,2025-04-30,10.1002/ccd.31418,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.31418,,Paid,105,5,1067-1076,Commissural Alignment in S3 Valves Impact on Gradient and Mortality at Follow Up UNZUE 2025,Not available,Commissural Alignment,CMA,SAPIEN,Follow-Up,Commissural,Edwards Lifesciences,Alignment,Gradient,years,Mortality,2025-04-30,approved,,SAPIEN 3 valves,TAVR,commissural alignment,,,,,,,,

This pilot study evaluated the feasibility and short-term effects of a home-based exercise program, with or without cognitive-behavioral intervention (CBI).\nMETHODS: We randomized 51 patients (mean age, 83.9 years; 19 women) to a home-based exercise program with CBI (Group A; n = 18) or without CBI (Group B; n = 15), or telephone-based education control (Group C; n = 18). The exercise program focusing on balance, flexibility, strength, and endurance began within 7 days post-discharge and was delivered once weekly by a physical therapist for 8 weeks. CBI included discussions on exercise benefits and barriers, goal setting, detailed exercise planning, and a weekly cash adherence incentive. The primary outcome was a disability score (range: 0-22; higher scores indicate greater disability) at 8 weeks. Secondary outcomes included the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) (range: 0-12; higher scores indicate better function), self-efficacy, and outcome expectation scores. Feasibility outcomes included adherence and drop-out rates.\nRESULTS: Fifteen participants (83.3%) in Group A, 10 (58.8%) in Group B, and 10 (52.6%) in Group C completed ≥ 5 of the eight assigned weekly sessions (p = 0.196). Two participants in each group were lost to follow-up. At 8 weeks, the home-based exercise groups (Group A and B combined) demonstrated lower disability scores (mean [SE]: 2.6 [0.3] vs. 4.5 [0.5]; p = 0.042) and higher SPPB scores (9.5 [0.6] vs. 6.5 [0.8]; p = 0.003) compared with the education group (Group C). Group A had lower disability scores than Group B (2.1 [0.4] vs. 3.4 [0.5]; p = 0.047), with no differences in self-efficacy and outcome expectation scores.\nCONCLUSIONS: An early, home-based, multi-domain exercise program appears feasible and may prevent disability and improve physical function in older adults after TAVR. Adding CBI, including a modest cash incentive, showed trends toward improved adherence and reduced disability.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02805309.",Sandra M Shi,Faith-Anne Rapley,Heather Margulis,Roger J Laham,Kimberly Guibone,Edward Percy,Tsuyoshi Kaneko,Kuan-Yuan Wang,Dae Hyun Kim,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,2025-04-02,10.1111/jgs.19456,https://doi.org/10.1111/jgs.19456,,Paid,,,,Home Based Rehabilitation After TAVR REHAB TAVR A Pilot RCT SHI 2025,Not available,Aortic Valve Replacement,Transcatheter Aortic Valve,Pilot Randomized Controlled,Randomized Controlled Trial,Valve Replacement,Transcatheter Aortic,Aortic Valve,Rehabilitation After Transcatheter,Group,Randomized Controlled,2025-04-30,,,randomized controlled trial,rehabilitation,transcatheter aortic valve replacement,,,,,,,,

However, data on long-term survival in Japan are limited and regional disparities remain. We aimed to evaluate long-term survival after TAVI using the Nara Kokuho Database (KDB). Patients who underwent TAVI between July 2014 and March 2023 were enrolled. The study outcomes were to evaluate survival rates after TAVI over 1-7 years and predict long-term prognostic factors using Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards model. Of 446 consecutive patients, 284 were female participants (63.7%). The mean age was 84.1 ± 4.3 years. The overall survival rates were 95.1-54.4% over 1-7 years. Cox proportional hazards model analysis revealed that younger age (< 85 years, hazard ratio [HR], 0.38; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.20-0.69; p = 0.002) and transfemoral approach (HR, 0.37; 95% CI 0.17-0.78; p = 0.009) were predictive factors. However, renal disease (HR, 2.02; 95% CI 1.08-3.77; p = 0.03), cerebrovascular disease (HR, 2.02; 95% CI 1.13-3.63; p = 0.02), and rheumatologic disease (HR, 2.71; 95% CI 1.19-6.18; p = 0.02) were poor long-term prognostic factors.

6812eaf04ef6922f6d6906ee,40163596,Cardiac Biomarkers in Patients with Asymptomatic Severe Aortic Stenosis: Analysis from the EARLY TAVR Trial.,"BACKGROUND: The EARLY TAVR trial demonstrated that early transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) intervention was superior to clinical surveillance (CS) with delayed TAVR in patients with asymptomatic, severe aortic stenosis (AS). Cardiac biomarkers are associated with maladaptive remodeling, symptom onset, and worse outcomes after TAVR. Whether elevated biomarkers identify asymptomatic patients more likely to benefit from early intervention is unknown.\nMETHODS: A core laboratory measured N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and high sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT). Associations between biomarker levels and risk of the trial primary endpoint (death, stroke, or unplanned cardiovascular hospitalization) and other secondary endpoints were examined with Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazard models. Interaction tests were performed to assess whether the treatment effect of early TAVR, compared with CS, differed according to biomarker levels.\nRESULTS: Among 901 patients randomized in EARLY TAVR, 798 (89%) had biospecimens measured (median NT-proBNP 287 [145, 601]; median hs-cTnT 14.6 [10.5, 21.0]). Higher levels of NT-proBNP and hs-cTnT were broadly associated with higher event rates for multiple endpoints. In general, there was no significant interaction between baseline biomarkers and treatment group with respect to any composite or individual endpoint examined, although trends broadly demonstrated a greater relative benefit of early TAVR at lower biomarker levels. There was a significant interaction between hs-cTnT and treatment group with respect to death or heart failure hospitalization (HFH) (interaction p=0.04) and HFH alone (interaction p=0.03) such that the relative benefit of early TAVR was greater for patients with normal, rather than elevated, levels of hs-cTnT at baseline. For some endpoints, higher baseline NT-proBNP was associated with numerically greater absolute risk reduction with early TAVR than lower NT-proBNP levels.\nCONCLUSIONS: In patients with asymptomatic severe high gradient AS, higher NT-proBNP and hs-cTnT levels were broadly associated with higher event rates as expected. However, the relative benefit of an early TAVR strategy was consistent regardless of baseline biomarker levels and, contrary to our hypothesis, tended to be more pronounced in those with the lowest biomarker levels. These findings suggest limited value for single measurements of these biomarkers to guide the timing of TAVR in asymptomatic patients.",Brian R Lindman,Philippe Pibarot,Allan Schwartz,J Bradley Oldemeyer,Yan Ru Su,Kashish Goel,David J Cohen,William F Fearon,Vasilis Babaliaros,David Daniels,Adnan Chhatriwalla,Hussam S Suradi,Pinak Shah,Molly Szerlip,Michael J Mack,Thom Dahle,William W O'Neill,Charles J Davidson,Raj Makkar,Tej Sheth,Jeremiah Depta,James T DeVries,Jeffrey Southard,Andrei Pop,Paul Sorajja,Rebecca T Hahn,Yanglu Zhao,Martin B Leon,Philippe Généreux,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Circulation,2025-03-31,10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.125.074425,https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.125.074425,,Paid,,,,Cardiac Biomarkers in Pts with Asymptomatic sAS Analysis from the EARLY TAVR Trial LINDMAN 2025,Not available,Severe Aortic Stenosis,EARLY TAVR,EARLY TAVR Trial,Aortic Stenosis,Asymptomatic Severe Aortic,TAVR,Severe Aortic,TAVR Trial,EARLY,Asymptomatic Severe,2025-04-30,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, most patients with valvular heart disease, including those undergoing transcatheter aortic-valve implantation (TAVI), have been excluded from randomized trials.\nMETHODS: We conducted this randomized, controlled trial in Spain to evaluate the efficacy of dapagliflozin (at a dose of 10 mg once daily) as compared with standard care alone in patients with aortic stenosis who were undergoing TAVI. All the patients had a history of heart failure plus at least one of the following: renal insufficiency, diabetes, or left ventricular systolic dysfunction. The primary outcome was a composite of death from any cause or worsening of heart failure, defined as hospitalization or an urgent visit, at 1 year of follow-up.\nRESULTS: A total of 620 patients were randomly assigned to receive dapagliflozin and 637 to receive standard care alone after TAVI; after exclusions, a total of 1222 patients were included in the primary analysis. A primary-outcome event occurred in 91 patients (15.0%) in the dapagliflozin group and in 124 patients (20.1%) in the standard-care group (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55 to 0.95; P = 0.02). Death from any cause occurred in 47 patients (7.8%) in the dapagliflozin group and in 55 (8.9%) in the standard-care group (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.59 to 1.28). Worsening of heart failure occurred in 9.4% and 14.4% of the patients, respectively (subhazard ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.88). Genital infection and hypotension were significantly more common in the dapagliflozin group.\nCONCLUSIONS: Among older adults with aortic stenosis undergoing TAVI who were at high risk for heart-failure events, dapagliflozin resulted in a significantly lower incidence of death from any cause or worsening of heart failure than standard care alone.

6812eaf14ef6922f6d6906f0,40158212,5-Year Outcomes After Transcatheter or Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement in Low-Risk Patients With Aortic Stenosis.,"BACKGROUND: The Evolut Low Risk trial demonstrated that transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) was noninferior to surgery for the primary endpoint of all-cause mortality or disabling stroke at 2 years. Outcomes at 5 years have not been reported.\nOBJECTIVES: This study sought to evaluate 5-year clinical and hemodynamic outcomes with TAVR vs surgery in patients from the Evolut Low Risk trial.\nMETHODS: We randomly assigned low-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis to TAVR or surgery. The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause mortality or disabling stroke. Secondary endpoints included clinical, echocardiographic, and quality-of-life outcomes through 5 years.\nRESULTS: A total of 1,414 patients underwent an attempted implant (n = 730 TAVR, n = 684 surgery). The mean age was 74 years (range 51-88 years), and women accounted for 35% of patients. At 5 years the Kaplan-Meier estimate for the primary endpoint of all-cause mortality or disabling stroke was 15.5% for the TAVR group and 16.4% for the surgery group (P = 0.47). The Kaplan-Meier estimates in the TAVR and surgery groups for all-cause mortality were 13.5% and 14.9% (P = 0.39) and for disabling stroke were 3.6% and 4.0% (P = 0.57). Cardiovascular mortality was 7.2% in the TAVR group and 9.3% in the surgery group (P = 0.15). Noncardiovascular mortality in the TAVR group was 6.8% and 6.2% in the surgery group (P = 0.73). A site-level vital status sweep was performed for patients who were lost to follow-up or withdrew from the study. With the addition of these patients, the all-cause mortality rate at 5 years for patients undergoing TAVR was 14.7% and for surgery was 15.2% (P = 0.74). Over 5 years, valve reintervention rate was 3.3% for TAVR and 2.5% for surgery (P = 0.44). A sustained improvement in quality of life was observed in both treatment arms with mean Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire summary score of 88.3 ± 15.8 in TAVR and 88.5 ± 15.8 in surgery.\nCONCLUSIONS: At 5 years, patients with severe aortic stenosis who were treated with either TAVR or surgery had comparable rates of all-cause mortality or disabling stroke. Valve durability and performance were excellent in both arms. This midterm evaluation reinforces the position of TAVR as noninferior to surgery in patients with severe aortic stenosis at low surgical risk (Medtronic Evolut Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Low Risk Patients; NCT02701283).",John K Forrest,Steven J Yakubov,G Michael Deeb,Hemal Gada,Mubashir A Mumtaz,Basel Ramlawi,Tanvir Bajwa,John Crouch,William Merhi,Stephane Leung Wai Sang,Neal S Kleiman,George Petrossian,Newell B Robinson,Paul Sorajja,Ayman Iskander,Pierre Berthoumieu,Didier Tchétché,Christopher Feindel,Eric M Horlick,Shigeru Saito,Jae K Oh,Yoojin Jung,Michael J Reardon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal of the American College of Cardiology,2025-04-22,10.1016/j.jacc.2025.03.004,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2025.03.004,,Paid,85,15,1523-1532,5 Year Outcomes After Transcatheter or SAVR in Low Risk Pts With AS FORREST 2025,Not available,Aortic Valve Replacement,Evolut Low Risk,transcatheter aortic valve,Evolut Transcatheter Aortic,TAVR,Low Risk,Low Risk trial,Valve Replacement,transcatheter aortic,Medtronic Evolut Transcatheter,2025-04-30,,,TAVR,aortic stenosis,low-risk,supra-annular self-expanding,surgery,,,,,,

It carries a high risk of spontaneous rupture and may lead to ventricular arrhythmias, heart failure, or thromboembolism. Cases of left ventricular pseudoaneurysm following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) are extremely rare, with most requiring emergency surgical intervention. We present a case of a patient who developed ventricular arrhythmia following transfemoral TAVI. Approximately one week after the procedure, the patient presented to the emergency department with ventricular tachycardia and was treated with amiodarone. A diagnosis of left ventricular pseudoaneurysm was established; however, the patient refused surgical treatment. Instead, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was placed, and the patient was managed with medical follow-up.

6812eaf24ef6922f6d6906f2,40135378,Transcarotid Versus Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement for the Treatment of Severe Aortic Stenosis.,"BACKGROUND: Current guidelines recommend surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) for patients with severe aortic stenosis and unfavorable iliofemoral access. Transcarotid transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TC-TAVR) has emerged as an alternative access in suboptimal transfemoral candidates, but no data exist comparing TC-TAVR and SAVR. The main objective of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes in a propensity-matched population of TC-TAVR and SAVR patients with severe aortic stenosis.\nMETHODS: A total of 786 patients (SAVR, 352; TC-TAVR, 434) were included, and a total of 182 patients were propensity-matched and included in each group. The primary outcome was a composite of death from any cause, stroke/transient ischemic attack, and procedure-related or valve-related hospitalization at 30 days and at 1 year. Data were prospectively collected in dedicated databases, and clinical events were defined according to Valve Academic Research Consortium-3 criteria.\nRESULTS: Baseline characteristics were well balanced between the matched groups, and the mean age and Society for Thoracic Surgeons score of the study population were 75 years and 3.6%, respectively. At 30 days, the SAVR group showed a higher rate of the primary composite outcome compared with the TC-TAVR group (12.6% versus 4.3%; hazard ratio, 2.93 [95% CI, 1.45-5.94]). Acute kidney injury stages 2 to 4, bleeding events, and new-onset atrial fibrillation occurred more often in the SAVR group during the hospital period (P<0.001). In contrast, vascular complications and the need for permanent pacemaker implantation occurred more often in the TC-TAVR group (P=0.01 and P=0.001, respectively). At 1-year follow-up, there were no significant differences between groups in the primary outcome rates (SAVR, 19.7% versus TC-TAVR, 12.7%; hazard ratio, 1.63 [95% CI, 0.98-2.73]).\nCONCLUSIONS: TC-TAVR was associated with improved 30-day clinical outcomes compared with SAVR, with no significant differences in death, stroke, and hospitalization at 1-year follow-up.

However, there is no direct evidence from randomized controlled trials supporting this practice. Furthermore, the optimal duration of antiplatelet therapy in this population has not been adequately investigated.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: CREATE (A Multicenter Randomized Controlled Study to Evaluate Cessation of Antithrombotic Therapy at 1 Year in TAVR Patients-The CREATE Study) is a prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial for patients who have undergone successful transcatheter aortic valve replacement and have no indication for long-term oral anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy. Eligible patients are free from major bleeding and ischemic events for 1 year postprocedure before being randomized 1:1 to single antiplatelet therapy (control group) or no antiplatelet therapy (experimental group). The primary efficacy end point is the incidence of bleeding events, defined by the VARC-3 (Valve Academic Research Consortium-3) criteria, at 1-year postrandomization. The primary safety end point is a composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and ischemic stroke at 1 year. The trial is powered for both superiority in efficiency and noninferiority in safety. Accordingly, a total of 3380 patients will be enrolled.\nCONCLUSIONS: The CREATE trial aims to assess if stopping antiplatelet therapy at 1-year after transcatheter aortic valve replacement reduces bleeding risk without increasing ischemic events in patients not requiring chronic antithrombotic therapy.\nREGISTRATION: URL: https://www.chictr.org.cn; Unique identifier: ChiCTR2400087454.",Ran Liu,Yang Li,Lihua Zhang,Zhinan Lu,Zhaolin Fu,Thomas Modine,Hasan Jilahawi,Stuart Pocock,Yongjian Wu,Guangyuan Song,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal of the American Heart Association,2025-04-30,10.1161/JAHA.124.039350,https://doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.124.039350,,Paid,14,7,e039350,Rationale and Design of the CREATE Trial A Multicenter Randomized Comparison of Continuation or Cessation of Single Antithrombotic Therapy at 1 Year After TAVR LIU 2025,Not available,Comparison of Continuation,Transcatheter Aortic Valve,Aortic Valve Replacement,Rationale and Design,Aortic Valve,antiplatelet therapy,single antiplatelet therapy,Transcatheter Aortic,Valve Replacement,Randomized Comparison,2025-04-30,approved,,antiplatelet therapy,aortic stenosis,transcatheter aortic valve replacement,treatment withdrawal,,,,,,,

A conventional meta-analysis followed by trial sequential analysis was conducted to evaluate the strength of the current evidence.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Databases were searched for randomized controlled trials. Primary outcomes included all stroke, disabling stroke, and all-cause mortality. Conventional study-level meta-analysis was performed using random-effects modeling. Trial sequential analysis was conducted to generate adjusted significance boundaries, futility boundaries, and the required information size considering a type I error of 5% and a power of 90%. Seven trials were included with a total of 4031 patients, of whom 2171 were treated with a device and 1860 were not. Conventional meta-analysis showed no significant difference in all stroke (relative risk [RR], 0.85 [95% CI, 0.61-1.18]; P=0.339) and disabling stroke (RR, 0.59 [95% CI, 0.30-1.13]; P=0.113) with device use. The trial sequential analysis determined an absence of evidence for all stroke (required information size of 71 650 [5.6%]) and disabling stroke (required information size of 337 256 [1.2%]). Conventional meta-analysis determined no significant difference in all-cause mortality (RR, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.49-2.17]; P=0.928) with device use.

We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of aortic valve replacement strategies in low- and intermediate-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis in China.\nMETHODS: A decision-analytic model combining decision tree and Markov model was developed to compare outcomes of universal SAVR, universal TAVR, and a risk-based strategy (SAVR in low-risk patients and TAVR in intermediate-risk patients) in a hypothetical cohort of 75-year-old patients with aortic stenosis within the perspective of the Chinese health care system. A meta-analysis was performed to derive the clinical inputs; the 2019 to 2021 claims data from Shaanxi Province were used for cost analysis, and quality of life was measured using EuroQoL-5D. One-way and probabilistic (10 000 Monte Carlo simulations) sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the robustness of model results. Primary outcomes included total costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).\nRESULTS: Universal TAVR gained the most QALYs (6.76 QALYs) with the highest costs (USD 58 949). Compared with universal SAVR, the risk-based strategy gained 0.12 additional QALYs at higher costs (USD 14 046); the ICER (117 048 USD/QALY) exceeded the willingness-to-pay threshold (37 657 USD/QALY, 3-fold gross domestic product per capita in China). The ICER of universal TAVR versus universal SAVR (80 526 USD/QALY) also exceeded the willingness-to-pay threshold. Sensitivity analysis showed that universal TAVR would be cost-effective if TAVR valve costs were <USD 21 477 (>44.23% cost reduction). Subgroup analysis showed that universal TAVR and risk-based strategy remained not cost-effective compared with universal SAVR in both low-risk (ICER of 64 414 USD/QALY) and intermediate-risk (ICER of 124 851 USD/QALY) patients. In 10 000 Monte Carlo simulations, the probabilities of being cost-effective for universal SAVR, universal TAVR, and risk-based strategy were 89.81%, 10.14%, and 0.05%, respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: The risk-based strategy and universal TAVR appeared not to be cost-effective versus universal SAVR in low- and intermediate-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis in China.",Jin Peng,Xinglong Zheng,Minghuan Jiang,Xuelin Yao,Yue Ma,Mao Fu,Tao Ma,Xiaolong Shang,Yang Yan,Vinod H Thourani,Yu Fang,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Circulation.

6812eaf94ef6922f6d6906f9,40035804,Precision medicine in the management of valvular heart disease.,"The management of valvular heart disease has undergone a remarkable transformation over the past two decades, which was driven by the advent of catheter-based treatment methods. Whereas medical therapy was the only available treatment option for many older patients deemed unsuitable for conventional surgery until the early 2000s, a wide range of interventional therapies is now available. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement and mitral valve transcatheter edge-to-edge repair evidently provide prognostic advantages over medical therapy for inoperable patients with severe aortic stenosis and secondary mitral regurgitation, and they have been demonstrated to be non-inferior to conventional surgery in certain operable patient groups. Although catheter-based therapies of aortic and tricuspid regurgitation have not yet been proven to provide prognostic benefits, these approaches enable substantial and sustainable improvements in symptoms as well as quality of life while demonstrating a favorable safety profile. Given the multitude of available options for the treatment of valvular heart diseases, determining the appropriate indication and selecting the optimal therapeutic approach often pose significant challenges. This review article highlights the latest advancements in valvular heart disease management and explores the patient-centered application of available therapies within the framework of an approach toward precision medicine.\nDurch die Etablierung kathetergestützter Behandlungsverfahren hat das Management von Herzklappenerkrankungen in den letzten beiden Dekaden eine revolutionäre Entwicklung genommen. Während für viele der oftmals älteren und nicht konventionell operablen Patienten bis Anfang der 2000er-Jahre eine medikamentöse Therapie die einzige Behandlungsoption war, stehen mittlerweile eine Vielzahl interventioneller Therapieverfahren zur Verfügung. Für den kathetergestützten Klappenersatz bei schwerer Aortenklappenstenose und die segelbasierte „Edge-to-Edge-Rekonstruktion“ bei sekundärer Mitralklappeninsuffizienz wurde nicht nur bei inoperablen Patienten ein prognostischer Vorteil im Vergleich zur medikamentösen Therapie gezeigt, sondern auch bei bestimmten, prinzipiell operablen Patientengruppen eine Nichtunterlegenheit zur konventionellen Chirurgie. Auch wenn ein prognostischer Nutzen für kathetergestützte Therapieverfahren der Aorten- und Trikuspidalklappeninsuffizienz bisher noch nicht gezeigt wurde, ermöglichen diese nachweislich eine substanzielle und nachhaltige Verbesserung der Symptomatik und Lebensqualität bei gutem Sicherheitsprofil. Die Indikationsstellung und die Auswahl des besten Therapieansatzes stellen angesichts der vielen Optionen zur Behandlung von Herzklappenfehlern heutzutage oftmals eine Herausforderung dar.

For patients who undergo aortic valve replacement (AVR), previous single institutional studies or case reports reported higher risks of mortality and thromboembolic complications among APS patients. This study aimed to investigate in-hospital outcomes of APS patients undergoing transcatheter (TAVR) and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) using the largest all-payer database in the United States.MethodsPatients who underwent TAVR and SAVR were selected from National Inpatient Sample from Q4 2015-2021. Exclusion criteria were age under 18 years and concomitant procedures. Preoperative characteristics were matched between APS and non-APA patients using a 1:5 propensity-score matching in TAVR and SAVR, separately. In-hospital outcomes were examined.ResultsAfter propensity-score matching, 504 non-APS patients were matched to 100 APS patients in TAVR, while 581 non-APS patients were matched to 119 APS patients in SAVR. All outcomes between APS and non-APS patients were comparable after TAVR. In contrast, APS patients undergoing SAVR had higher risks of pulmonary embolism (PE; 5.13% vs 0.86%, p < .01) and acute kidney injury (AKI; 35.04% vs 22.55%, p = .01).ConclusionThis study represents one of the first large-scale, population-based analyses of AVR outcomes for APS patients using a national registry. APS patients had all comparable outcomes after TAVR, while they had higher risks of PE and AKI after SAVR.

6812eafd4ef6922f6d6906fb,39945944,No-Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) Zones and Their Effect on Access to Care for Medicare Beneficiaries with Aortic Stenosis.,"INTRODUCTION: This study investigates the impact of geographic and socioeconomic barriers on access to transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).\nMETHODS: Utilizing Medicare data from the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, this study analyzed TAVR and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) procedures among beneficiaries from 2017 to 2022. Geographic units were defined by 5-digit zip codes, categorized on the basis of TAVR/SAVR volume into four categories: (1) no TAVR or SAVR, (2) no-TAVR zone (SAVR present, no TAVR), (3) low-TAVR zone (TAVR/SAVR ratio ≤ 0.5), and (4) TAVR accessible (TAVR/SAVR ratio > 0.5). The differential distance index (DDI) was developed to measure travel hurdles, calculated as the difference in miles from a patient's zip code center to the treatment hospital (TAVR versus SAVR, CABG (coronary artery bypass grafting), and PCI (percutaneous coronary intervention) comparators). This study maintained a continuous access variable to model outcomes such as the ratio or volume of TAVR/SAVR and the percentage share of TAVR/AVR within each zip code over biennial periods (2017-2018, 2019-2020, 2021-2022). Covariates in the model included population density, area deprivation index (ADI), and calendar time, with an exploration of the interaction between DDI and ADI.\nRESULTS: The analysis revealed significant geographic disparities in TAVR access across the USA, with no-TAVR zone and low-TAVR zone areas often featuring lower population densities, higher ADIs, and more rural settings. Increased travel distance (DDI) significantly correlated with lower TAVR utilization, emphasizing distance as a critical barrier. Furthermore, both ADI and DDI emerged as significant predictors of TAVR volume and share, underlining the compound effect of socioeconomic status and geographic distance on healthcare access.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the critical role of geographic and socioeconomic barriers in accessing advanced medical treatments like TAVR. Addressing these barriers may ensure equitable healthcare distribution, guiding policymakers and providers towards more accessible healthcare solutions for all populations.",Guy David,Andrew J Epstein,Jay Giri,Ashwin Nathan,Soumya G Chikermane,Michael Ryan,Christin Thompson,Seth Clancy,Candace Gunnarsson,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Advances in therapy,2025-04-30,10.1007/s12325-025-03116-8,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12325-025-03116-8,PMC11929678,Free,42,4,1716-1728,No TAVR TAVR Zones and Their Effect on Access to Care for Medicare Beneficiaries with AS DAVID 2025,pdfs\No TAVR TAVR Zones and Their Effect on Access to Care for Medicare Beneficiaries with AS DAVID 2025.pdf,TAVR,Aortic Valve Replacement,Aortic Valve,SAVR,TAVR versus SAVR,Valve Replacement,transcatheter aortic valve,Medicare,Access,Aortic,2025-04-30,approved,,Aortic stenosis,Area deprivation index,Geographic disparities,Socioeconomic barriers,Transcatheter aortic valve replacement,,,,,,

Bleeding events were classified according to the VARC-2 and VARC-3 definitions.\nRESULTS: Bleeding events occurred in 17.6% of patients, with early bleeding (in-hospital) in 12.5% and late bleeding (occurring after discharge) in 6.1%. The primary vascular access site was the most common source of early bleeding, whereas gastrointestinal bleeding was predominant in late events. Significant predictors of early VARC-3-defined bleeding included active cancer, previous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, history of mitral valve surgery, a non-transfemoral approach and occurrence of an in-hospital major vascular complication or new-onset atrial fibrillation. Late bleeding was independently associated with a history of myocardial infarction and treatment with vitamin K antagonists at discharge. Early bleeding events were not associated with increased late all-cause mortality. No significant difference was observed based on the VARC-2 and VARC-3 bleeding definitions.\nCONCLUSIONS: Bleeding events occurred in one sixth of patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation without significant difference in their incidence between the VARC-2 and VARC-3 classifications. Early bleeding events were not associated with poorer long-term survival, regardless of the classification used.

The primary outcome was HAVB >24 h after TAVR or ventricular pacing need RESULTS: Out of 97 included patients, 8 experienced the primary outcome (7 with HAVB and 1 with PM need). On univariate analysis, pre- and post-TAVR PR, post-TAVR HV, and Delta-HV intervals were predictors of the primary outcome. A Delta-HV interval ≥18 ms predicted HAVB with sensitivity = 50% and specificity = 90% (AUC = 0.708, PPV = 31%), while an HV interval ≥60 ms after TAVR had sensitivity = 63% and specificity = 79% (AUC = 0.681, PPV = 21%). None of the patients with a PR interval ≤180 ms post-TAVR experienced the primary outcome. Among patients with new-onset LBBB, an HV interval post-TAVR >65 ms was the only predictor of HAVB (AUC = 0.776, PPV = 33%, and NPV = 97%).\nCONCLUSION: The yield of periprocedural EP assessment during TAVR is limited considering that about half of the at-risk patients fail to be identified. However, early periprocedural risk stratification may be more useful in the subset of patients with new-onset LBBB. Among ECG findings, a post-TAVR PR interval ≤180 ms identifies a subgroup at very low risk, independently of QRS interval and morphology.",Mattia Pagnoni,David Meier,Adrian Luca,Stephane Fournier,Farhang Aminfar,Christelle Haddad,Niccolo Maurizi,Giulia Domenichini,Mathieu Le Bloa,Claudia Herrera Siklody,Cheryl Teres,Stephane Cook,Jean-Jacques Goy,Mario Togni,Christan Roguelov,Grégoire Girod,Vladimir Rubimbura,Marion Dupré,Eric Eeckhout,Etienne Pruvot,Olivier Muller,Patrizio Pascale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Pacing and clinical electrophysiology : PACE,2025-04-30,10.1111/pace.15159,https://doi.org/10.1111/pace.15159,,Paid,48,4,377-385,Role of Routine Electrophysiological Study Performed During TAVR to Predict AV Block PAGNONI 2025,Not available,Routine Electrophysiological Study,Electrophysiological Study Performed,Transcatheter Aortic Valve,Aortic Valve Replacement,Study Performed,Aortic Valve,Routine Electrophysiological,Electrophysiological Study,Transcatheter Aortic,Valve Replacement,2025-04-30,approved,,HV interval,atrioventricular block,electrophysiological study,permanent pacemaker implantation,trans‐catheter aortic valve replacement,,,,,,

A five-stage system based on the presence and extent of cardiac damage assessed by echocardiography was applied before and 6 months after TAVI. Multivariable Cox regression analyses were used to examine independent prognostic value of the changes in cardiac damage after TAVI. A total of 734 patients with severe AS (mean age, 79.8 ± 7.4 years; 55% male) were included. Before TAVI, 32 (4%) patients did not show any sign of extra-valvular cardiac damage (Stage 0), 85 (12%) had left ventricular damage (Stage 1), 220 (30%) left atrial and/or mitral valve damage (Stage 2), 227 (31%) pulmonary vasculature and/or tricuspid valve damage (Stage 3), and 170 (23%) right ventricular damage (Stage 4). Six months after TAVI, 39% of the patients improved at least one stage in cardiac damage. Staging of cardiac damage at 6 months after TAVI [hazard ratio (HR) per one-stage increase, 1.391; P = 0.035] as well as worsening in the stage of cardiac damage (HR, 3.729; P = 0.005) were independently associated with 2-year all-cause mortality.\nCONCLUSION: More than one-third of patients with severe AS showed an improvement in cardiac damage 6 months after TAVI.

The effects of the use of CCBs on the prognosis of patients with aortic stenosis (AS) after transcatheter aortic valve intervention (TAVI) has not been explored. This study elucidated the effects of the use of CCBs on clinical outcomes of patients who underwent TAVI for severe AS. This retrospective observational study included 993 consecutive patients who underwent TAVI for severe AS between January 2017 and July 2023. All patients were followed up for all-cause mortality and hospitalisation for heart failure. Composite endpoints between patients with and without CCBs at discharge were compared using propensity score matching (PSM). CCBs were administered to 590 (59.4%) patients following TAVI. Over a median follow-up period of 719 (335-1,120) days, the composite endpoint occurred in 269 patients. After PSM, there was no significant difference in the composite endpoint between the two groups (hazard ratio = 0.879; p = 0.409). Subgroup analysis revealed that the use of CCBs was associated with a better prognosis in the CAD subgroup (p for interaction = 0.002).

However, its impact on long-term clinical outcomes remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the impact of early HALT detection after TAVI on long-term clinical outcomes and structural valve deterioration beyond 6 years.\nMETHODS: Of the 672 consecutive patients who underwent TAVI between 2013 and 2018, 448 were treated with either SAPIEN XT or SAPIEN 3 and underwent MDCT analysis within 30 days after TAVI. MDCT results and echocardiographic data were analyzed annually.\nRESULTS: HALT was detected in 68 (15.2%) of 448 eligible patients within 30 days after TAVI. No significant difference in effective orifice area was observed by echocardiography within 30 days after TAVI between the HALT and the non-HALT groups in SAPIEN XT (HALT vs. non-HALT: 1.62 ± 0.66 cm2 vs. 1.72 ± 0.43 cm2; p = 0.26) and in SAPIEN 3 (1.42 ± 0.35 cm2 vs. 1.45 ± 0.34 cm2; p = 0.63).

This study describes the outcomes of TAVI performed in Qatar.\nMETHODS: The Qatar TAVI registry (QATAVI) was established to report the outcomes of TAVI procedures performed at Hamad Medical Corporation- Heart Hospital between October 2012 and December 2023. Data were collected both prospectively and retrospectively.\nRESULTS: 241 patients underwent TAVI, with a mean age of 73 ± 8 years. The device success rate was 98.8 %. In-hospital para-valvular leak (PVL) was as follows; mild 8.3 %, moderate 0.8 %, and severe 0.0 %. At 1-year, PVL was mild 2.9 %, moderate 0.4 %, and severe 0.0 %. At 2 years, 0.4 % had mild PVL, moderate 0.4 %, and severe 0.0 %. The incidence of stroke was 2.1 % during hospitalization, 2.1 % at 1 year, and 1.2 % at 2 years. For myocardial infarction, the in-hospital rate was 0.8 %, at 1 year 3.3 %, and 1.2 % at 2 years. 3.7 % developed heart failure during the hospital stay, 15.4 % at 1 year, and 4.6 % at 2 years.

Recent advances in microbiological epidemiology have highlighted staphylococci and enterococci as the primary pathogens involved.\nAIM: To investigate the prevalence of these bacteria in patients' cutaneous flora before and after transcatheter aortic valve implantation procedures, and to assess the implications for antibiotic prophylaxis recommendations.\nMETHODS: A single-centre prospective epidemiological study was conducted, enrolling patients admitted consecutively for transcatheter aortic valve implantation procedures between June 2021 and February 2022. Cutaneous samples were obtained from each patient at the puncture site of the transcatheter aortic valve implantation procedure, before and after skin detersion, and from operator hands after skin detersion.\nRESULTS: One hundred patients were included, with a mean age of 82±6.1years, a male-to-female ratio of 0.48 and a mean body mass index of 29±4.4kg/m2. Before skin detersion, cutaneous samples were positive in 58 patients; among them were coagulase-negative staphylococci (n=48, 82%, 95% confidence interval 71-91%), enterococci (n=12, 21%, 95% confidence interval: 11-33%), Staphylococcus aureus (n=2, 3%, 95% confidence interval 0-12%) and Enterobacteriaceae (n=4, 7%, 95% confidence interval: 2-17%).\nCONCLUSIONS: Enterococci are frequently present in patients' cutaneous flora at the puncture site before skin detersion, suggesting a potential source for infective endocarditis after transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Data regarding its impact on mortality and morbidity are conflicting. This study aims to assess the impact of PPI before or within 30 days after TAVI on mortality and health-related Quality of Life (QoL) during the first year after TAVI.\nMETHODS: In this POPular TAVI substudy, 978 patients were included and categorized into three groups: Neither PPI before or within 30 days after TAVI (no PPI, n = 779), PPI before TAVI (PPI pre-TAVI, n = 102), PPI within 30 days after TAVI (PPI post-TAVI, n = 97). All-cause death and cardiac death were evaluated at 1 year. QoL was assessed using the SF-12 and EQ-5D-5L questionnaires at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months.\nRESULTS: At 1-year, all-cause death was seen in 6.9% (PPI pre-TAVI, p = 0.53) and 10.3% (PPI post-TAVI, p = 0.66) of the patients compared to 8.7% of the patients (no PPI). Cardiac death was observed in 4.9% (PPI pre-TAVI, p = 0.58) and 6.2% (PPI post-TAVI, p = 0.94) of the patients compared to 6.2% of patients (no PPI). Regarding QoL, the PPI pre-TAVI group showed lower PCS-12 over time compared to the no PPI group (p = 0.04), while MCS-12, EQ-5D Index and EQ-5D VAS scores were equal. No significant differences in QoL were seen between the PPI post-TAVI group and the no PPI group.\nCONCLUSION: PPI before or within 30 days after TAVI was not associated with increased mortality within 1 year.

The aim of this study was to identify anatomic predictors of access-related VCs after TAVR on preprocedural contrast-enhanced multidetector computed tomography (MDCT).\nAIMS: The aim of this study was to identify anatomical predictors of access-related VCs after TAVR on preprocedural contrast-enhanced MDCT.\nMETHODS: A total of 348 consecutive patients with symptomatic severe AS who underwent transfemoral TAVR were included retrospectively. The primary endpoint of the study was the composite of minor and major access site complications as defined by the Valve Academic Research Consortium-3 (VARC-3) criteria. The study population was divided into two groups according to the VC including VC (+) and VC (-).\nRESULTS: A total of 101 patients (29%) developed VC (8.7% major, 20.3% minor) following TAVR. Regression analysis identified severe CFA calcification (p = 0.004), CFA depth (p < 0.001), minimum CFA diameter (p < 0.001), CFA depth-to-diameter ratio ≥ 5.6 (p < 0.001), and sheath-to-femoral artery ratio (SFAR) (p < 0.001) as significant predictors of VC. ROC curves generated for the occurrence of VC, the AUC for the femoral artery depth-to-diameter ratio (0.720) was higher than the AUC for the SFAR and the depth of the femoral artery (0.636, 0.630).\nCONCLUSION: Complications related to vascular access sites continue to be a significant concern for patients undergoing TF-TAVR.

6812eb074ef6922f6d690705,39866003,Left Main Coronary Occlusion During TAVI Procedure: Calcium Embolization Matters.,"Acute coronary occlusion during transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an unwarranted complication associated with high mortality. The current TAVI practices recommend a multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) evaluation of the aortic valve, the left ventricular outflow tract, and the aortic root to determine the conventional risk factors for coronary obstruction like low-lying coronary ostia and narrow sinuses of Valsalva, mandating prophylactic coronary protection or native valve leaflet modification in high-risk patients. Despite optimal anatomy, acute coronary occlusion can still occur due to multiple mechanisms, one of which is coronary embolism due to thrombus, calcium, or native aortic valve fragments. A sudden hemodynamic collapse during a TAVI procedure in the absence of apparent causes always raises the suspicion of coronary occlusion, which requires a prompt percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to save the patient's life.

6812eb074ef6922f6d690706,39865958,Image-Based Analysis of Correlation Between Valve Stent Deformation and Valve Function in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Currently, there remains a paucity of research on the deformation and valve function of transcatheter heart valves (THV) in patients with aortic regurgitation (AR) following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). This study aimed to thoroughly explore the correlation between THV deformation and postoperative hemodynamics in these patients.\nMETHODS: In this study, we assessed 39 AR patients treated with the J-Valve THV system during TAVR. We utilized postoperative cardiac-enhanced computed tomography angiography (CTA) to examine the extent of stent deformation, correlating these measurements with concurrent echocardiographic data.\nRESULTS: Among patients with AR, the J-Valve exhibited three distinct configurations: rectangular, trapezoidal, and inverted trapezoidal shapes. The rectangular configuration showed a trend toward a larger effective orifice area (EOA) compared to the trapezoidal and inverted trapezoidal configurations (rectangular: 2.20 ± 0.11 cm², trapezoidal: 1.88 ± 0.08 cm², inverted trapezoidal: 2.04 ± 0.08 cm²; p = 0.068). Stratified analysis of the degree of inclined commissural posts indicated that THVs with all three commissural angles < 5° exhibited the highest standard EOA (sEOA). An increase in the number and degree of inclined commissural posts correlated with a decrease in sEOA. Furthermore, a higher EOA was observed when the expansion in the mid and transition level exceeded 80%.\nCONCLUSIONS: During the TAVR procedure, ensuring sufficient expansion in the mid and transition level of the stent, maintaining the stent in a rectangular configuration, and avoiding tilting of the commissural posts contribute to achieving favorable postoperative hemodynamics.",Min Jin,Qing Zhou,Shuchun Li,Haitao Zhang,Dongjin Wang,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,2025-04-30,10.1002/ccd.31421,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.31421,,Paid,105,5,1056-1066,Image Based Analysis of Correlation Between Valve Stent Deformation and Valve Function in TAVR JIN 2025,Not available,Aortic Valve Replacement,Transcatheter Aortic Valve,Valve Replacement,Aortic Valve,Valve Function,Valve Stent Deformation,transcatheter heart valves,Transcatheter Aortic,Valve,Valve Stent,2025-04-30,approved,,computed tomography,geometry,stent frame,transcatheter aortic valve replacement,,,,,,,
6812eb084ef6922f6d690707,39864769,Transcatheter vs Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement in Medicare Beneficiaries With Aortic Stenosis and Coronary Artery Disease.,"BACKGROUND: As percutaneous therapeutic options expand, the optimal management of severe aortic stenosis (AS) and concomitant coronary artery disease (CAD) is being questioned between coronary artery bypass grafting with surgical aortic valve replacement (CABG+SAVR) and percutaneous coronary intervention with transcatheter aortic valve replacement (PCI+TAVR). This study sought to compare perioperative and longitudinal risk-adjusted outcomes between patients undergoing CABG+SAVR and patients undergoing PCI+TAVR.\nMETHODS: Using the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services inpatient claims database, the study evaluated all patient aged 65 years and older with AS and CAD who were undergoing CABG+SAVR or PCI+TAVR (from 2018 to 2022). Comorbidities and frailty were accounted for using validated metrics with doubly robust risk adjustment using inverse probability weighting, multilevel regression, and competing-risk time to event analyses. The primary end point was a 5-year composite of stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), valve reintervention, or death.\nRESULTS: A total of 37,822 patients formed the study cohort (PCI+TAVR, n = 17,413; CABG+SAVR, n = 20,409). Accounting for age, comorbidities, frailty, and number of vessels revascularized, PCI+TAVR was associated with lower procedural mortality (1.1% vs 3.6%; odds ratio [OR], 0.29; P <.001) but higher vascular complications (OR, 6.02; P <.001) and new permanent pacemaker (OR, 1.92; P <.001). However, the longitudinal 5-year primary end point favored CABG+SAVR (20.4% vs 14.2%; OR, 1.44, P <.001). Subgroup analyses demonstrated a benefit in the use of arterial conduit in CABG+;AVR in patients with single-vessel CAD.\nCONCLUSIONS: Among Medicare beneficiaries with severe AS and CAD, CABG+SAVR was associated with higher procedural mortality than PCI+TAVR but lower 5-year risk-adjusted stroke, MI, valve reintervention, and death.",Vikrant Jagadeesan,J Hunter Mehaffey,Mohammed A Kawsara,Dhaval Chauhan,J W Awori Hayanga,Christopher E Mascio,J Scott Rankin,Ramesh Daggubati,Vinay Badhwar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The Annals of thoracic surgery,2025-04-30,10.1016/j.athoracsur.2024.12.016,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.athoracsur.2024.12.016,,Paid,119,4,843-851,Transcatheter vs SAVR in Medicare Beneficiaries With AS and CAD JAGADEESAN 2025,Not available,Coronary Artery Disease,Aortic Valve Replacement,Surgical Aortic Valve,Coronary Artery,Artery Disease,Surgical Aortic,Aortic Stenosis,Aortic Valve,transcatheter aortic valve,Valve Replacement,2025-04-30,approved,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, iterations of existing transcatheter aortic valves (TAVs), as well as devices with novel concepts, have provided substantial improvements with respect to the limitations of previous-generation devices. Hence, treatment of a broader spectrum of patients has become feasible, and a sophisticated selection of the appropriate TAV tailored to patients' anatomy and comorbidities is now possible.

We measured acute recoil, deployment asymmetry, and length asymmetry from intraprocedural angiogram before and after postdilation, as well as before and after predilation. Hemodynamic and procedural outcomes were studied.\nRESULTS: Among 946 patients, 9% had BAV. In the RAO view, BAV patients had significantly higher absolute and relative acute recoil across all diameters, while in the LAO view, only central diameter relative recoil was significantly higher (p < 0.001). Deployment asymmetry was more common in BAV patients with an OR of 1.88 (CI 1.19, 2.96; p = 0.01). Predilation reduced both length and deployment asymmetry in RAO and LAO views for TAV and BAV patients (p < 0.001). Postdilation significantly reduced acute valve recoil in both groups (p = 0.002 and p = 0.032).

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has emerged as a promising alternative for these patients, however, this patient population was underrepresented in prior TAVR trials.\nAIMS: To compare the outcomes of TAVR in patients with versus without a history of prior chest or mediastinal radiation.\nMETHODS: This study was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Systematic search of electronic databases was conducted up to September 2023. We compared early and late mortality as well as complications. A meta-analysis was conducted with the use of a random effects model. The I-square statistic was used to assess heterogeneity.\nRESULTS: Seven studies comprising 6358 patients were included in this meta-analysis. Patients undergoing TAVR in the radiation group had a higher risk for heart failure exacerbation (OR: 2.06; 95% CI: 1.18-3.59) and aortic valve reintervention (OR: 5.68; 95% CI: 1.83-17.67) in the early postoperative period compared to the nonradiation group. Analysis revealed similar short-term (in-hospital or 30-day) all-cause-mortality (OR: 1.63; 95% CI: 0.89-2.98) between the two groups. Other perioperative complications including myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, pacemaker insertion requirement, major bleeding as well as access-related complications were not significantly different between the two groups. TAVR in the radiation group was not associated with increased all-cause mortality compared to the nonradiation group (OR: 1.40; 95% CI: 0.93-2.11) after a mean follow-up of 17.6 months. Other endpoints including MI, stroke, need for pacemaker insertion, heart failure readmission rate, and need for aortic valve reintervention were similar in the mid-term follow-up between the two groups.\nCONCLUSION: TAVR in patients with a history of prior chest or mediastinal radiation was associated with similar short-term and mid-term mortality compared to patients without radiation. The history of chest or mediastinal radiation was associated with more frequent heart failure hospitalizations and aortic valve reintervention in the postoperative period. No difference was found in mid-term complications.

Based on the Valve Academic Research Consortium's three definitions, the endpoints were hemodynamic structural valve deterioration (SVD) and bioprosthetic valve failure (BVF). Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was used to compare between the two groups and adjust for baseline characteristics. The Fine-Gray subdistribution hazard model accounted for the competing risk of death.\nRESULTS: In total, 565 patients (204 treated with SEV and 361 treated with BEV) were included. The median follow-up duration was 3.6 years [2.0 years, 5.7 years], and the maximum was 12.3 years. Hemodynamic SVD and BVF were less frequently identified in the SEV group than in the BEV group (1.1% vs. 9.1% within 5 years, 0.7% vs. 8.1% within 5 years, respectively). On the IPTW adjusted Fine-Gray subdistribution hazard model analysis, hemodynamic SVD was less frequent in SEV compared with BEV (Hazard Ratio [HR]: 0.16; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.04-0.56, p = 0.004). SEV was also associated with a lower BVF risk than BEV (HR: 0.25; 95% CI: 0.08-0.76, p = 0.015).\nCONCLUSIONS: SEV appears to be more suitable for long-term valve durability in patients with a small aortic annulus.",Yutaka Matsuhiro,Isamu Mizote,Daisuke Nakamura,Tomoharu Dohi,Koichi Maeda,Kazuo Shimamura,Ai Kawamura,Kizuku Yamashita,Shumpei Kosugi,Shota Okuno,Hiroki Sugae,Yasuharu Takeda,Yasushi Sakata,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,2025-04-30,10.1002/ccd.31415,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.31415,PMC11962832,Free,105,5,990-997,Long Term Bioprosthetic Valve Durability After TAVR With Supra Annular Self Expanding Versus Intra Annular Balloon Expandable Valves in Pts With a Small Aortic Annulus MATSUHIRO 2025,pdfs\Long Term Bioprosthetic Valve Durability After TAVR With Supra Annular Self Expanding Versus Intra Annular Balloon Expandable Valves in Pts With a Small Aortic Annulus MATSUHIRO 2025.pdf,Aortic Valve Replacement,SEV versus BEV,Transcatheter Aortic Valve,Valve,Aortic Valve,SEV,Small Aortic Annulus,Aortic,Small Aortic,Valve Durability,2025-04-30,approved,,bioprosthetic valve failure,small aortic annulus,structural valve deterioration,transcatheter aortic valve replacement,,,,,,,

Fractional flow reserve (FFR) to guide revascularization in such patients is not validated.\nAIMS: We describe changes in coronary physiology in this population before and after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).\nMETHODS: Patients with stable CAD and severe AS treated with TAVI were prospectively included during 2020-2023. Coronary physiology was assessed before and immediately after TAVI, and at follow-up (median 5.4 months).\nRESULTS: Twenty-nine patients (mean age 81.3 years) were included. Median (95% confidence interval) FFR decreased numerically, from 0.83 (0.79-0.84) pre-TAVI to 0.81 (0.78-0.83) post-TAVI. During hyperaemia, the transit mean time reduced numerically, from 0.27 (0.19-0.35) to 0.20 (0.18-0.27) seconds, reflecting increased coronary flow. Basal microvascular resistance increased numerically, from 24 (21-35) to 32 (23-45), while resistive reserve ratio increased significantly, from 1.8 (1.5-2.3) to 2.6 (2.2-3.1) (P=0.002). Consequently, coronary flow reserve (CFR) improved significantly, from 1.5 (1.2-1.7) to 1.9 (1.5-2.4) (P=0.006). Among 21 patients with follow-up, no significant change in FFR was observed and the significance of the increase in CFR was lost. Only three patients had an index of microvascular resistance>25, indicating microvascular impairment during hyperaemia.\nCONCLUSIONS: In stable CAD patients treated with TAVI for severe AS, valve replacement provides an immediate improvement in CFR. FFR shows a minimal decrease after valve implantation, supporting its reproducibility to guide revascularization in such patients.\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: .NCT04663334.",Quentin Battistolo,Robin Le Ruz,Pierre-Guillaume Piriou,Patrice Guerin,Vincent Letocart,Julien Plessis,Alexandra Poinas,Thomas Senage,Thibaut Manigold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Archives of cardiovascular diseases,2025-04-30,10.1016/j.acvd.2024.12.006,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acvd.2024.12.006,,Paid,118,4,222-230,Changes in microcirculation following TAVI in Pts with stable CAD BATTISTOLO 2025,Not available,coronary artery disease,artery disease,transcatheter aortic valve,patients,aortic valve implantation,coronary,coronary artery,TAVI,coronary physiology,stable CAD,2025-04-30,approved,,Aortic stenosis,Coronary artery disease,Coronary flow reserve,Fractional flow reserve,Transcatheter aortic valve implantation,,,,,,

Limited data exist on the incidence and microbiological profile of early bacteraemia in this population. This study aimed to evaluate the 6-month incidence of bacteraemia, IE and associated mortality following TAVI.\nMETHODS: Using Danish nationwide registries, all patients who underwent TAVI from 2012 to 2021 were identified and matched 1:1 by age, sex and index year with patients who underwent elective coronary angiography (CAG). Outcomes were assessed with cumulative incidence functions and adjusted HRs.\nRESULTS: Among 5990 patients with first-time TAVI (57% male, mean age 80 years, SD 6.9), bacteraemia occurred in 4.2% within 6 months, compared with 2.6% in the CAG group (adjusted HR 1.57, 95% CI 1.26 to 1.96). Common pathogens post-TAVI included Streptococci (20%), Coagulase-negative staphylococci (19%) and Enterococci (18%), differing from the CAG group, where Coagulase-negative staphylococci (22%) and Staphylococcus aureus (16%) predominated.

The aim of this study was to assess the characteristics and outcomes of different AS phenotypes on the basis of flow and gradient patterns.\nMETHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, 930 patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement for severe symptomatic AS at Mayo Clinic sites from 2012-2017 were included. Patients were classified into three groups: high gradient (HG), low-flow low-gradient (LFLG), and normal-flow low-gradient (NFLG). Baseline clinical, echocardiographic, and computed tomographic characteristics, including aortic valve area, aortic valve calcium score, left ventricular ejection fraction, and the prevalence of tricuspid regurgitation, and atrial fibrillation were analyzed. One- and 5-year all-cause mortality outcomes were compared using Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional-hazards models.\nRESULTS: The final cohort included 273 patients in the NFLG group (29.4%), 563 in the HG group (60.5%), and 94 in the LFLG group (10.1%). After reevaluation and careful review of the echocardiograms, 41 patients with NFLG AS were reclassified into the LFLG group. Patients with LFLG AS had the highest prevalence of atrial fibrillation or flutter (60%) and tricuspid regurgitation (17%). Aortic valve calcium score was significantly lower in the NFLG group compared with the HG and LFLG groups. One-year mortality was highest in the LFLG group (17.4%), followed by the HG (13.9%) and NFLG (10.9%) groups, but the difference was not statistically significant (P = .20). The 5-year mortality rate was higher in the LFLG group (55.6%) compared with the NFLG (47.2%) and HG (47.9%) groups but did not reach statistical significance (P = .20).\nCONCLUSIONS: LFLG AS was associated with more comorbidities and higher mortality compared with HG and NFLG AS, though differences in mortality were not statistically significant. The NFLG group, after close review and reclassification, showed the least significant AS. Randomized trials are needed to clarify the prognosis and management of NFLG AS.",Amro Badr,Mustafa Suppah,Kamal Awad,Juan Farina,Bobbi Jo Heon,Rachel Wraith,Bishoy Abraham,Sara Kaldas,Vuyisile Nkomo,Reza Arsanjani,Chieh-Ju Chao,David Holmes,Said Alsidawi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography : official publication of the American Society of Echocardiography,2025-04-30,10.1016/j.echo.2024.12.010,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.echo.2024.12.010,,Paid,38,4,310-319,Reevaluating Normal Flow Low Gradient sAS Clinical Phenotypes and Outcomes in sAS Among TAVR Pts BADR 2025,Not available,Severe Aortic Stenosis,Aortic Stenosis,Transcatheter Aortic Valve,Aortic Valve Replacement,Aortic Valve,Low-Gradient Severe Aortic,Severe Aortic,NFLG,aortic valve calcium,LFLG group,2025-04-30,approved,,Aortic stenosis,Echocardiography,High-gradient,Low-flow low-gradient,Mortality,Normal-flow low-gradient,Transcatheter aortic valve replacement,,,,
6812eb154ef6922f6d690713,39762512,Early clinical outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve implantation using the NAVITOR system.,"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) using the NAVITOR system has been relatively underreported due to its recent introduction in Japan. This study aimed to assess the short-term outcomes of TAVI with the NAVITOR in real-world clinical practice. Patients with severe aortic stenosis who underwent TAVI using the NAVITOR system at our institution between December 2022 and December 2023 were prospectively enrolled. We evaluated the 30-day post-TAVI outcomes using the Valve Academic Research Consortium 3 (VARC-3). Among 32 consecutive patients (mean age, 84 years; 19% female), technical success was achieved in 31 (96.8%). One patient developed a subclavian artery vascular dissection, requiring balloon angioplasty during the TAVI procedure, and another received a permanent pacemaker due to persistent advanced atrioventricular block. At the 30-day follow-up, device success was achieved in 31 (96.8%) patients, with early safety observed in 27 (84.3%). One patient experienced sudden unexplained death after discharge. None of the patients experienced myocardial infarction, valve embolisation, life-threatening bleeding, or acute kidney injury within 30 days after the procedure. Echocardiographic follow-up showed a median effective orifice area index of 1.26 ± 0.27. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography was performed in 19 patients 30 days after the procedure, revealing hypo-attenuated leaflet thickening (HALT) in 10 (52.6%). Although the 30-day outcomes of TAVI using the NAVITOR system appeared promising, a relatively high incidence of HALT was observed.",Kosuke Fujita,Koichiro Matsumura,Keishiro Sugimoto,Kyohei Onishi,Kazuyoshi Kakehi,Ayano Yoshida,Takayuki Kawamura,Masakazu Yasuda,Hiroki Matsuzoe,Kazuki Mizutani,Tatsuya Miyoshi,Masafumi Ueno,Genichi Sakaguchi,Gaku Nakazawa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cardiovascular intervention and therapeutics,2025-04-30,10.1007/s12928-024-01081-7,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12928-024-01081-7,PMC11910440,Free,40,2,378-388,Early clinical outcomes of TAVI using the NAVITOR system FUJITA 2025,pdfs\Early clinical outcomes of TAVI using the NAVITOR system FUJITA 2025.pdf,NAVITOR system,NAVITOR valve,NAVITOR,transcatheter aortic valve,aortic valve implantation,TAVI,valve,valve NAVITOR system,aortic valve,system,2025-04-30,approved,,Aortic stenosis,Hypo-attenuated leaflet thickening,NAVITOR system,Transcatheter aortic valve implantation,,,,,,,

6812eb184ef6922f6d690715,39695013,Comparison of invasive and non-invasive gradients before and after TAVI and their implications on clinical outcomes.,"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is recommended for treatment of high-risk aortic stenosis patients. While measuring mean transaortic valve gradient (MG) is crucial in evaluating procedural success, echocardiographic measurements often overestimate direct invasive measurements. This study aimed to examine the discordance between echocardiographic and invasive MGs in TAVI patients and assess their prognostic value on long-term outcomes. This prospective registry included consecutive TAVI patients at a tertiary university hospital. Transthoracic or transoesophageal echocardiography was performed pre-TAVI, at discharge, 1 month, 1, and 5 years with invasive MG measurements obtained peri-procedurally. The primary endpoints were 5-year all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiac events. Among 1353 patients from 2011 to 2023, non-invasive MGs exceeded invasive MGs pre- and post-implantation (43 [36, 52] mmHg vs. 40 [30, 50] mmHg, p < 0.001; 9 [6, 12] mmHg vs. 4 [2, 7] mmHg, p < 0.001) Pre-procedural MGs correlated better than post-procedural MGs (r = 0.70, p < 0.001 vs. r = 0.23, p < 0.001), particularly in self-expandable valves and smaller sinus of Valsalva diameter (SOVd) (r = 0.33, p < 0.001; r = 0.46, p < 0.001 vs R = 0.06, p = 0.701). Non-invasive MG remained stable from discharge (9 [6, 12] mmHg) to 5 years (9 [7, 12] mmHg). While structural valve deterioration and patient-prosthesis mismatch showed no impact, extreme invasive MGs (< 3 or > 6 mmHg) predicted worse outcomes (mortality hazard: 1.25 [1.06, 1.88] and 0.85 [0.8, 0.95], respectively), unlike non-invasive measurements. In conclusion, invasive as compared with non-invasive MGs correlated better before than after valve implantation, whereas invasive MGs were always lower than non-invasive MGs. Lower invasive MGs after TAVI appeared to be associated with favourable long-term outcomes.",Anna Pfenniger,Thorald Stolte,Jakob Johannes Reichl,Gregor Leibundgut,Max Wagener,Christoph Kaiser,Jasper Boeddinghaus,Felix Mahfoud,Thomas Nestelberger,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cardiovascular intervention and therapeutics,2025-04-30,10.1007/s12928-024-01074-6,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12928-024-01074-6,PMC11910411,Free,40,2,362-377,Comparison of invasive and non invasive gradients before and after TAVI and their implications on clinical outcomes PFENNIGER 2025,pdfs\Comparison of invasive and non invasive gradients before and after TAVI and their implications on clinical outcomes PFENNIGER 2025.pdf,TAVI,invasive MGs,invasive,aortic valve,Transcatheter aortic valve,aortic valve implantation,MGs,valve,TAVI patients,non-invasive MGs,2025-04-30,approved,,Aortic stenosis,Structural valve deterioration,Transcatheter aortic valve implantation,Transthoracic echocardiography,Transvalvular pressure gradient,,,,,,

We describe robotic aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting through a right lateral approach.\nDESCRIPTION: A 73-year-old woman with severe aortic insufficiency, 70% LAD stenosis, and ejection fraction of 0.35 presented with recalcitrant symptoms. She sustained a stroke 1 year before surgery. She was frail, with a body mass index of 17 kg/m2. Her Society of Thoracic Surgeons predicted risk of mortality was 10%. Given minimal leaflet calcium, transcatheter options were declined, and she was referred for high-risk nonsternotomy surgical consideration.\nEVALUATION: After informed consent, a single-incision 4-cm right lateral working incision facilitated on-pump arrested fully robotic 23-mm bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement and LITA-LAD grafting. The LITA harvest time was 43 minutes, and LAD anastomosis was 27 minutes. This frail patient recovered expectantly and was discharged home.\nCONCLUSIONS: Robotic aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting is feasible and may represent a viable future option for patients with concomitant aortic valve and coronary disease.",Vinay Badhwar,Goya V Raikar,Ali Darehzereshki,J Hunter Mehaffey,Ramesh Daggubati,Lawrence M Wei,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The Annals of thoracic surgery,2025-04-30,10.1016/j.athoracsur.2024.12.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.athoracsur.2024.12.002,,Paid,119,4,918-922,Robotic Assisted AVR and Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting BADHWAR 2025,Not available,Coronary Artery Bypass,Aortic Valve Replacement,Artery Bypass Grafting,Coronary Artery,Artery Bypass,Aortic Valve,Robotic-Assisted Aortic Valve,Valve Replacement,robotic aortic valve,Replacement and Coronary,2025-04-30,approved,,,,,,,,,,,,
6812eb194ef6922f6d690717,39565946,Intravascular lithotripsy-assisted intervention in patients with congenital heart disease.,"OBJECTIVES: The use of intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) in patients with calcified coronary and peripheral arterial disease is now commonplace; however, its use in procedures specific to congenital heart disease is rare, with a very limited published case-based experience to date. The authors report the outcomes of 4 patients with congenital heart disease who underwent IVL-assisted transcatheter procedures in the effort to inform future operators as to the potential benefits and risks of this technology in this patient population.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Four patients underwent IVL-assisted transcatheter procedures including branch pulmonary artery stenting, aortic coarctation stenting, and transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement. All 4 patients underwent successful IVL-assisted implantation of large stents in highly calcified native or surgically implanted biological conduits without significant complications.\nCONCLUSIONS: The use of IVL-assisted interventions in patients with severe native or surgical calcified vascular conduits is feasible and may be a useful adjunct in conduit stent implantation and dilation. Vascular injury during angioplasty of calcified vessels and conduits remains a concern despite the use of lithotripsy, and covered stent implantation should be considered prior to aggressive dilation in order to reduce the risk of catastrophic rupture.",Zachary L Steinberg,Lauren N Carlozzi,Brian H Morray,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The Journal of invasive cardiology,2025-04-30,10.25270/jic/24.00272,https://doi.org/10.25270/jic/24.00272,,Paid,37,4,,Intravascular lithotripsy assisted intervention in Pts with congenital heart disease STEINBERG 2025,Not available,congenital heart disease,congenital heart,heart disease,Intravascular lithotripsy-assisted intervention,patients,IVL-assisted transcatheter procedures,Intravascular lithotripsy-assisted,disease,underwent IVL-assisted transcatheter,heart,2025-04-30,approved,,calcified vessels,congenital heart disease,intravascular lithotripsy,vascular disease,,,,,,,
6812eb1a4ef6922f6d690718,39535527,Prolonged atrial refractoriness to predict the onset of atrial fibrillation after transcatheter aortic valve implantation.,"BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common atrial arrhythmia after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) and is associated with high mortality. Although some clinical and echocardiographic variables have been defined to predict new-onset atrial fibrillation (NOAF), electrophysiologic (EP) parameters have not been identified yet. We aimed to investigate the impact of atrial refractoriness on NOAF after TAVI.\nMETHODS: Seventy-nine consecutive patients who underwent TAVI were enrolled in this trial. All patients undergoing TAVI were screened for AF.\nRESULTS: Fifteen (19%) had AF during the follow-up period. Patients with NOAF were older and had a higher BMI and STS. Left atrial diameter (LAD) was higher, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was lower, and preprocedural LVEDP was higher in patients with NOAF. As electrophysiologic (EP) parameters, atrial effective refractory periods (AERP) (in high right atrium [AERP<inf>HRA</inf>], in right posterolateral atrium [AERP<inf>RPL</inf>], and in distal coronary sinus [AERP<inf>DCS</inf>]) were lower, difference between atrial effective refractory periods (AERP<inf>DISP</inf>) and PA intervals were higher in patients with AF than those without AF. The only independent parameter that influenced the development of AF after TAVI was AERP<inf>DISP</inf>. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that an AERP<inf>DISP</inf>>46 msec significantly separated those with AF and those without AF with a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 97%.\nCONCLUSIONS: The current study demonstrates that the only independent variable predicting NOAF is AERPDISP. Therefore, increased AERPDISP values may help predict patients with high risk for NOAF and needing specific therapies.",Özcan Özdemir,Ersin Doğanözü,Onur Yildirim,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Minerva cardiology and angiology,2025-04-30,10.23736/S2724-5683.24.06605-5,https://doi.org/10.23736/S2724-5683.24.06605-5,,Paid,73,2,166-173,Prolonged atrial refractoriness to predict the onset of AFib after TAVI ÖZDEMIR 2025,Not available,aortic valve implantation,transcatheter aortic valve,AERP,atrial,valve implantation,transcatheter aortic,aortic valve,atrial fibrillation,TAVI,NOAF,2025-04-30,approved,,,,,,,,,,,,

HSI was used to determine tissue oxygenation (StO2 and NIR), hemoglobin (THI) and water content (TWI) at the palm before/after surgery (T1/T2), and on the third postoperative day (T3). TAVR patients showed no significant changes of microcirculatory parameters during surgery. TWI significantly increased until T3. SAVR patients showed an increase of TWI and a decrease of THI, while StO2 and NIR remained unchanged at T2. In SAVR patients, StO2 and NIR correlated negatively with the duration of CPB and StO2 correlated with intraoperative urine output at T2.

Yet, clinical/anatomical differences and outcomes between patients with and without ESRD-HD remain underexplored. This single-center study enrolled consecutive patients who underwent TAVR with the SAPIEN 3 between 2021 and 2023. Baseline characteristics and outcomes up to 1 year were compared. Inverse probability treatment weighting (IPTW) approach and Cox regression were used. Among 287 eligible patients, 59 had ESRD-HD. Patients with ESRD-HD were predominantly male (59.2% vs. 40.7%; p = 0.01), younger (78.0 [73.5-83.5] vs. 84.0 [79.8-88.0]; < 0.001), with lower body mass index (21.4 [19.6-23.3] vs. 22.9 [20.3-25.3]; p = 0.02], higher surgical risk (Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality ≧8%: 28 [47.5%] vs. 34 [14.9%]; p < 0.001), and more peripheral artery disease (25.4% vs. 4.8%; p < 0.001). Patients with ESRD-HD had a significantly higher prevalence of severely calcified femoral arteries (12.5% vs. 2.6%; p < 0.001). However, there were no differences in the computed-tomographic (CT) anatomical characteristics of the aortic valve complex (AVC), including the aortic valve calcium score (1995 [1372-3374] vs. 2195 [1380-3172]; p = 0.65) or the presence of moderate or severe left ventricular outflow tract calcification (4.3% vs. 5.2%; p > 0.99).

Although clinicians remain vigilant about screening for both aortic stenosis, many patients still, nevertheless, often present only when they are symptomatic. Unfortunately, when isolated TAVR is performed in the context of hostile aortic pathology, it has been reported that patients suffer from higher rates of complications such as rupture, dissection, or death post-operatively.\nOBJECTIVES: To explore the utility of a simultaneous TAVR and endovascular aortic repair in addressing symptomatic aortic stenosis in challenging patients with hostile aortic pathology.\nMETHODS: Retrospective case series within a tertiary care hospital between May 2017 and December 2023.\nRESULTS: A total of 11 patients underwent simultaneous endovascular aortic repair and TAVR. TAVR was performed first in 9/11 (82%) of the procedures while endovascular aortic repair was performed first in 2/11 procedures (18%). The median age was 84 years old (IQR = 77-86 years old). The median LOS was 3 days (IQR = 2-10 days). The median procedure time was 155 minutes (IQR = 111-202 minutes) and the median contrast amount was 100 CC (IQR = 65-139 CC). 2 patients (18%) experienced post-operative complications. Both of these patients required re-intervention. This cohort of patients did not experience any mortality at 30 days related to pertinent complications or adverse MACE events. All patients were transferred to the PACU and ultimately discharged home.\nCONCLUSIONS: Extending TAVR eligibility to high-risk patients with hostile aortic pathology through the implementation of simultaneous endovascular aortic repair, performed via the same access site, is an effective strategy for management of symptomatic aortic stenosis in the context of extensive cardiovascular co-morbidities.",Jeffrey Lu,Benjamin Zambetti,Joshua Plant,Anuj Gupta,Khanjan Nagarsheth,Shahab Toursavadkohi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Vascular and endovascular surgery,2025-04-30,10.1177/15385744241292122,https://doi.org/10.1177/15385744241292122,,Paid,59,3,257-265,Simultaneous Endovascular Aortic Repair Expands TAVR Eligibility to Pts With Hostile Aortic Pathology LU 2025,Not available,Transcatheter Aortic Valve,Aortic Valve Replacement,Expands Transcatheter Aortic,Repair Expands Transcatheter,Aortic Repair Expands,Hostile Aortic Pathology,Endovascular Aortic Repair,Valve Replacement,Valve Replacement Eligibility,Expands Transcatheter,2025-04-30,approved,,EVAR,TAVR,abdominal aortic aneurysm,aortic stenosis,endovascular,multi-disciplinary,,,,,
6812eb224ef6922f6d69071e,39343570,Association between the Mean Platelet Volume and Prosthesis-patient Mismatch after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.,"Objective The mean platelet volume (MPV), a marker of platelet activity, is significantly higher in patients with aortic stenosis (AS) than in those without AS. The association between the platelet function and prosthesis-patient mismatch (PPM) after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) remains unknown. Therefore, we investigated this association by measuring the MPV. Methods Of 237 patients who underwent TAVR, 148 with a median age of 84 years old were enrolled in this study. Blood tests and transthoracic echocardiography were performed at baseline and approximately six months after TAVR. PPM was defined as an aortic valve area index ≤0.85 cm2/m2 after TAVR. Variable changes from baseline to six-month follow-up were compared between patients with and without PPM. Results Forty-five patients (30%) developed PPM. The MPV was significantly higher in patients with PPM than in those without PPM. However, regarding the magnitude of change, the MPV was significantly less reduced in patients with PPM, and the percentage of patients with reduced MPV was lower in patients with PPM than in those without PPM. A logistic regression analysis revealed that a higher MPV and lack of MPV reduction at the six-month follow-up were independent predictors of PPM. Conclusion MPV values at the six-month follow-up were associated with PPM after TAVR in patients with AS. MPV values increase when PPM is present after TAVR and may be an indicator during the postoperative follow-up.",Yuichi Morita,Hiroki Ikenaga,Atsushi Takeda,Takayuki Nakano,Tasuku Higashihara,Noriaki Watanabe,Yoshiharu Sada,Hiroto Utsunomiya,Shinya Takahashi,Yukihiro Fukuda,Yukiko Nakano,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",2025-04-15,10.2169/internalmedicine.4205-24,https://doi.org/10.2169/internalmedicine.4205-24,,Paid,64,8,1171-1179,Association between the Mean Platelet Volume and PPM after TAVR MORITA 2025,Not available,Aortic Valve Replacement,Transcatheter Aortic Valve,PPM,Platelet Volume,MPV,Aortic Valve,Prosthesis-patient Mismatch,Valve Replacement,Transcatheter Aortic,TAVR,2025-04-30,,,aortic stenosis,mean platelet volume,prosthesis-patient mismatch,transcatheter aortic valve replacement,,,,,,,

We aimed to analyze the incidence, clinical impact, and predictors of acquired thrombocytopenia after TAVI.\nMETHODS: This retrospective multicenter registry included 3913 patients undergoing TAVI with a baseline platelet count of ≥ 100 *109/L. Acquired thrombocytopenia was defined as a decrease in baseline platelet count of ≥ 50% (early nadir ≤ 3 days and late nadir ≥ 4 days) post-TAVI. The primary endpoint was 30-day all-cause mortality and secondary endpoints were procedural safety and 2-year all-cause mortality.\nRESULTS: The incidence of acquired thrombocytopenia was 14.8% (early nadir: 61.5%, late nadir: 38.5%). Thirty-day mortality occurred in 112 (3.0%) patients and was significantly higher in those with thrombocytopenia (8.5% vs 2.0%, adjusted OR, 2.3; 95%CI, 1.3-4.2). Procedural safety was lower and 2-year mortality was higher in patients with thrombocytopenia vs those without (52.1 vs 77.0%; P <.001, and 30.2% vs 16.8%; HR, 2.2, 95%IC, 1.3-2.7) and especially in those with late nadir thrombocytopenia (45.8% vs 54.5%; P=.056, and 38.6% vs 23.8%, HR, 2.1; 95%CI, 1.5-2.9). Independent predictors of thrombocytopenia comprised baseline and procedural factors such as body surface area, absence of diabetes, poorer renal function, peripheral vascular disease, nontransfemoral access, vascular complications, type of transcatheter heart valve, and earlier TAVI procedures.\nCONCLUSIONS: Acquired thrombocytopenia was common (15%) after TAVI and was associated with increased short- and mid-term mortality and decreased procedural safety. Moreover, late thrombocytopenia compared with early thrombocytopenia was associated with significantly worse clinical outcomes.

We aimed to investigate gender-specific differences in TAVI and its impact on outcomes.\nMETHODS: This analysis used data from the prospective Spanish TAVI registry, which included consecutive TAVI patients treated in 46 Spanish centers from 2009 to 2021. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality at 12 months. Secondary endpoints included in-hospital and 30-day mortality and TAVI-related complications. Adjusted logistic and Cox regression analyses were performed.\nRESULTS: The study included 12 253 consecutive TAVI patients with a mean age of 81.2±6.4 years. Women (53.9%) were older, and had a higher STS-PROM score (7.0±7.0 vs 6.2±6.7; P < .001) than men. Overall, the TAVI-related complication rate was similar between women and men, with specific gender-related complications. While women more frequently developed in-hospital vascular complications (13.6% vs 9.8%; P <.001) and cardiac tamponade (1.5% vs 0.6%; P=.009), men showed a higher incidence of permanent pacemaker implantation (14.5% vs 17.4%; P=.009). There was no difference in all-cause mortality either in hospital (3.6% vs 3.6%, adjusted OR, 1.01; 95%CI, 0.83-1.23; P=.902), at 30 days (4.2% vs 4.2%, adjusted OR, 0.90; 95%CI, 0.65-1.25; P=.564) or at 1 year (11% vs 13%, adjusted HR, 0.94; 95%CI, 0.80-1.11; P=.60).\nCONCLUSIONS: Women treated with TAVI are older and have more comorbidities than men, leading to distinct complications between genders.

6812eb244ef6922f6d690722,39178930,Guidelines vs Practice: Surgical Versus Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Adults ≤60 Years.,"BACKGROUND: Consensus guidelines recommend surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) over transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in patients with severe aortic stenosis aged ≤65 years. This analysis evaluates clinical practice and outcomes of TAVR and SAVR in patients aged ≤60 years.\nMETHODS: We identified 2360 patients aged ≤60 years, including 523 TAVR (22.2%) and 1837 SAVR (77.8%) procedures, from 2013 through 2021 using the California Department of Health Care Access and Information database. The median follow-up time was 2.4 years (interquartile range, 1.1-4.5 years) after TAVR and 4.9 years (interquartile range, 2.8-6.9 years) after SAVR. The primary outcome was 5-year survival. Secondary outcomes included cumulative incidences of reoperation, endocarditis, stroke, and heart failure readmissions with death as a competing risk, compared using propensity score matching.\nRESULTS: Between 2013 and 2021 TAVR rates in patients aged ≤60 years increased from 7.2% to 45.7% (annual increase of 4.7%, P < .001). Mortality at 30 days was similar for SAVR and TAVR (0.2% vs 0.4%, P = .20). In 358 propensity-matched pairs, TAVR was associated with an increased hazard of 5-year mortality (hazard ratio, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.1-3.7; P = .02). There was no significant difference in the cumulative incidences of reoperation (2.2% vs 3.8%, P = .25), stroke (1.1% vs 0.8%, P = .39), endocarditis (0.8% vs 0.4%, P = .38), and heart failure readmission (1.9% vs 1.2%, P = .10).\nCONCLUSIONS: TAVR use approaches SAVR use in patients aged ≤60 years in California and is associated with significantly worse 5-year survival.

6812eb244ef6922f6d690723,39097143,A risk model of mortality rate in dialysis patients following transcatheter aortic valve replacement.,"BACKGROUND: Dialysis patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) generally have poor prognosis compared with non-dialysis patients. Furthermore, there are few reliable risk models in this clinical setting. Therefore, we aimed to establish a risk model in dialysis patients undergoing TAVR that would be informative for their prognosis and the decision-making process of TAVR.\nMETHODS: A total 118 dialysis patients (full cohort) with severe aortic stenosis underwent TAVR in our institute between 2012 and 2022. The patients of the full cohort were randomly assigned to two groups in a 2:1 ratio to form derivation and validation cohorts. Risk factors contributing to deaths were analyzed from the preoperative variables and a risk model was established from Cox proportional hazard model.\nRESULTS: There were 69 deaths following TAVR derived from infectious disease (43.5 %), cardiovascular-related disease (11.6 %), cerebral stroke or hemorrhage (2.9 %), cancer (1.4 %), unknown origin (18.8 %), and others (21.7 %) during the observational period (811 ± 719 days). The cumulative overall survival rates using the Kaplan-Meier method at 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years in the full cohort were 82.8 %, 41.9 %, and 24.2 %, respectively. An optimal risk model composed of five contributors: peripheral vascular disease, serum albumin, left ventricular ejection fraction < 40 %, operative age, and hemoglobin level, was established. The estimated C index for the developed models were 0.748 (95 % CI: 0.672-0.824) in derivation cohort and 0.705 (95 % CI: 0.578-0.832) in validation cohort. The prediction model showed good calibration [intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.937 (95%CI: 0.806-0.981)] between actual and predicted survival.\nCONCLUSIONS: The risk model was a good indicator to estimate the prognosis in dialysis patients undergoing TAVR.",Kizuku Yamashita,Koichi Maeda,Kyongsun Pak,Kazuo Shimamura,Ai Kawamura,Isamu Mizote,Masaki Taira,Daisuke Yoshioka,Shigeru Miyagawa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal of cardiology,2025-04-30,10.1016/j.jjcc.2024.07.009,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jjcc.2024.07.009,,Paid,85,4,329-333,A risk model of mortality rate in dialysis Pts following TAVR YAMASHITA 2025,Not available,aortic valve replacement,transcatheter aortic valve,Dialysis patients undergoing,dialysis patients,patients undergoing TAVR,valve replacement,risk model,aortic valve,TAVR,undergoing transcatheter aortic,2025-04-30,rejected,,Aortic stenosis,Dialysis,Risk model,Transcatheter aortic valve implantation,Transcatheter aortic valve replacement,,,,,,
6812eb264ef6922f6d690724,38695370,Impact of aortic root geometry and degree of aortic calcification on outcomes of patients undergoing TAVI procedure.,AimsAdequate differentiation of calcifications in contrast-enhanced CT scans remains difficult to assess TAVI parameters. The size of the aortic leaflets has not been taken into account so far in present studies. The aim of our study was to establish a new method for optimized quantification of the aortic valve calcification degree in contrast-enhanced CT scans for better preoperative prediction of postoperative paravalvular leak after TAVI.Methods and resultsWe retrospectively analyzed preoperative contrast-enhanced CT scans of patients who underwent TAVI in our institution between 2014 and 2017. Calcium volume was quantified by a method using contrast enhanced computer tomography (3mensio-Structural Heart-7.2 software) with different iodine contents for better discrimination of contrast agent from calcium and by an individually set Houndsfield Unit (HU) threshold with 50HU above the individually determined reference value. Calcium volume was correlated with surface area of each aortic cusp. Perioperative variables were analyzed. All patients (n = 150) with severe aortic stenosis were treated with TAVI implantation. Overall incidence of postoperative trace to moderate PVL was 37%. The amount of calcium correlated with the incidence of PVL. In a logistic regression analysis total volume of calcification (p = .032) as well as calcification of each aortic cusp (NC_p = .001; RC_p < .001; LC_p = .001) were independent predictors.ConclusionsCalcification degree as well as its correlation with the surface area of each aortic cusp significantly influence incidence of PVL.

We aim to reevaluate the evidence using trial sequential analysis, balancing type I and II errors, and compare with conventional meta-analysis.\nMETHODS: Databases were searched for randomized controlled trials, which were divided into higher-risk and lower-risk randomized controlled trials according to a pragmatic risk classification. Primary outcomes were death and a composite end point of death or disabling stroke assessed at 1 year and maximum follow-up. Conventional meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis were performed, and the required information size was calculated considering a type I error of 5% and a power of 90%.\nRESULTS: Eight randomized controlled trials (n = 5274 higher-risk and 3661 lower-risk patients) were included. Higher-risk trials showed no significant reduction in death at 1 year with transcatheter aortic valve implantation (relative risk, 0.93, 95% CI, 0.81-1.08, P = .345). Lower-risk trials suggested lower death risk on conventional meta-analysis (relative risk, 0.67, 95% CI, 0.47-0.96, P = .031), but trial sequential analysis indicated potential spurious evidence (P = .116), necessitating more data for conclusive benefit (required information size = 5944 [59.8%]). For death or disabling stroke at 1 year, higher-risk trials lacked evidence (relative risk, 0.90, 95% CI, 0.79-1.02, P = .108). In lower-risk trials, transcatheter aortic valve implantation indicated lower risk in conventional meta-analysis (relative risk, 0.68, 95% CI, 0.50-0.93, P = .014), but trial sequential analysis suggested potential spurious evidence (P = .053), necessitating more data for conclusive benefit (required information size = 5122 [69.4%]). Follow-up results provided inconclusive evidence for both primary outcomes across risk categories.\nCONCLUSIONS: Conventional meta-analysis methods may have prematurely declared an early reduction of negative outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve implantation when compared with surgical aortic valve replacement.",Xander Jacquemyn,Michel Pompeu Sá,Filip Rega,Peter Verbrugghe,Bart Meuris,Derek Serna-Gallegos,James A Brown,Marie-Annick Clavel,Philippe Pibarot,Ibrahim Sultan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,2025-04-30,10.1016/j.jtcvs.2024.04.007,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcvs.2024.04.007,,Paid,169,4,1214-1225.e5,Transcatheter versus SAVR for severe aortic valve stenosis Meta analysis with trial sequential analysis JACQUEMYN 2025,Not available,aortic valve,surgical aortic valve,aortic valve replacement,Randomized controlled trials,trial sequential analysis,transcatheter aortic valve,aortic valve implantation,trial sequential,Randomized controlled,sequential analysis,2025-04-30,rejected,,aortic valve replacement,cardiac surgical procedures,cardiovascular surgical procedures,heart valve diseases,heart valve prosthesis implantation,meta-analysis,,,,,

Pooled hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed. Employing network meta-analysis, a comparison involving four post-procedural TR categories (improved, no improvement, worsened, and no change) was executed. Subsequently, these categories were amalgamated into two groups (less TR after TAVR and same or greater TR after TAVR), and a standard meta-analysis was conducted. Kaplan-Meier curves depicting long-term all-cause mortality were reconstructed utilizing individual patient data derived from the studies.ResultsA systematic review identified seven non-randomized studies encapsulating 698 patients. Network meta-analysis revealed that improved TR after TAVR correlated with significantly lower long-term all-cause mortality compared to the remaining cohorts. Similarly, pooled all-cause mortality of standard meta-analysis demonstrated significant reduction in patients whose TR was sub-baseline than those exhibiting same or greater TR after TAVR (HR [95% CI] = 0.43 [0.32-0.58], p < .01). The hazard ratio, derived from reconstructed time-to-event data, showed a lower long-term all-cause mortality in patients with less TR after TAVR relative to the other cohort (HR [95% CI] = 0.46 [0.32-0.67], p < .01).ConclusionThis meta-analysis revealed that improved TR after TAVR correlates with superior long-term survival.

This retrospective, single-center study involved 403 patients (mean age: 78.2 ± 8.4; 50.9% female). RV-PA coupling was categorized based on the pre-procedural TAPSE/sPAP ratio: severe uncoupling (≤0.32), moderate uncoupling (0.32-0.55), and normal coupling (>0.55). The study primary endpoints were in-hospital mortality and 2-year all-cause mortality. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that the TAPSE/sPAP ratio is an independent predictor of both in-hospital (adjusted OR: 0.61, 95% CI [0.44-0.84], P = .002) and 2-year mortality (adjusted OR: 0.69, 95% CI [0.56-0.85], P = .001). Severe uncoupling was strongly associated with increased 2-year mortality (adjusted OR: 3.92, 95% CI [1.67-9.20], P = .002). Our study establishes a significant association between reduced preoperative TAPSE/sPAP ratios and increased risks of both in-hospital and 2-year all-cause mortality in patients undergoing TAVI for severe AS. These results highlight the prognostic utility of evaluating RV-PA coupling.

A cost analysis of TAVI hospitalization was performed considering costs related to procedural complications and post-procedural length of stay (LoS).\nRESULTS: Between January 2020 and December 2023, a total of 997 patients underwent TAVI following an optimized, minimalistic pathway. Device success was reported in 88.2% patients, with low procedural complications. The primary endpoint occurred in 21.1% of patients. After PSM, TAVI patients following the minimalistic pathway had higher device success (91.4% vs 84.2%, p = 0.004), and lower major vascular complications (4.5% vs. 10.3%, p = 0.004) compared to those following the standard approach. Median LoS was shorter (1.0 day vs. 2.0 days, p < 0.001) and the rate of next-day discharge was higher (46.7% vs. 19.0%, p < 0.001) in patients following the minimalistic pathway, with lower hospitalization costs (median € 2200 vs. 3150; p < 0.001). At 30-day, the primary endpoint was significantly lower in patients following the minimalistic pathway (17.2% vs 23.9%, p = 0.034).\nCONCLUSIONS: The minimalistic TAVI care pathway was associated with favorable outcomes in an unselected, real-world population. The shorter post-procedural LoS of the minimalistic approach led to a significant cost-saving.",Marco Barbanti,Giuliano Costa,Valentina Frittitta,Elena Dipietro,Alessandro Comis,Mariachiara Calì,Sofia Sammartino,Wanda Deste,Luigi La Rosa,Valeria Garretto,Cristina Inserra,Maria Teresa Cannizzaro,Carmelo Sgroi,Pierfrancesco Veroux,Davide Capodanno,Corrado Tamburino,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Clinical research in cardiology : official journal of the German Cardiac Society,2025-04-29,10.1007/s00392-025-02654-z,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00392-025-02654-z,PMC6288866,Free,,,,"A minimalistic approach for TF TAVI therapy a prospective ""real world"" study BARBANTI 2025",pdfs\A minimalistic approach for TF TAVI therapy a prospective real world study BARBANTI 2025.pdf,TAVI,transcatheter aortic valve,aortic valve,aortic valve implantation,TAVI approach,fast-track TAVI,TAVI procedures,patients undergoing TAVI,TAVI procedures performed,patients,2025-04-30,rejected,,Early discharge,Minimalistic approach,Procedural pathway,TAVI,,,,,,,

Primary endpoint was long-term mortality. In-hospital mortality, stroke, acute kidney failure, need for new permanent pacemaker, and duration of intervention were secondary endpoints.\nRESULTS: 4555 patients undergoing TAVI were retrospectively included. 231 matched (77:154) patients were analyzed. BViV-TAVI was a rare event (1.9%). In 76.7% of the cases transcatheter valve embolization and migration were the reasons for implanting a second valve in the same procedure. Significant PVL accounted for bViV-TAVI in 23.4% of the patients. The duration of the intervention was significantly longer for the bViV-TAVI group (p < 0.001). BViV-TAVI patients showed higher rates of a new permanent pacemaker implantation (p = 0.013) and the postprocedural mean pressure was significantly higher (p = 0.03). Concerning the other secondary endpoints there was a trend for a higher event rate in bVIV-TAVI patients which did not reach significant difference. After an average follow-up period of 4.9 ± 3.0 years, mortality was significantly higher in the bViV-TAVI group (54.5% vs. 39.0%, p = 0.025).\nCONCLUSION: The implantation of a second valve during the same procedure as bail-out is a feasible alternative treatment option in patients with failed transcatheter aortic valve procedures.

This meta-analysis aims to compare the outcomes of TAVI between patients with and without AAD. We systematically searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Springer, Cochrane, and Clinicaltrials.gov. for articles up to 25 March 2024 (PROSPERO ID CRD42024526311). A total of 204,078 patients from ten studies were included. Paravalvular regurgitation (RR 1.56 95 %CI: 1.32-1.84, p < 0.00001, I2 = 0 %) and aortic dissection (RR 3.55 95 %CI: 1.79-7.06, p = 0.0003, I2 = 40 %) were more common in AAD group. However, there were no differences in peri-procedural (RR 1.09, 95 %CI: 0.83-1.42, p = 0.53, I2 = 0 %) and 1-year (RR 0.79, 95 %CI: 0.51-1.23, p = 0.30, I2 = 0 %) mortality.

Haemodynamic stabilization was achieved only after implantation of an Impella CP, through a trans-femoral approach. Considering the prohibitive surgical risk, the mitral valve regurgitation was treated with a transcatheter edge-to-edge repair procedure, which allowed to successfully wean the patient from Impella. Subsequently, a transcatheter aortic valve implantation was performed. The patient's clinical status improved to such a level that a rehabilitation program was successfully implemented.\nDISCUSSION: Our report shows that an entirely percutaneous approach, to manage a combined severe aortic and mitral regurgitation, complicated by cardiogenic shock, is feasible and effective.",Francesco Lo Iudice,Amelia Ravera,Alfonso Campanile,Stefano Romei,Francesco Vigorito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,European heart journal.

The association between HE4 and diffuse myocardial fibrosis was also assessed using T1 mapping on cardiac magnetic resonance in a subgroup of 43 patients.\nRESULTS: During a median follow-up of 2.5 (IQR: 1.9-3.2) years, 34/362 (9.4%) patients were rehospitalized for heart failure, 99/362 (27.3%) died, and 113/362 (31.2%) met the composite endpoint of rehospitalization for heart failure or all-cause mortality. In multivariable Cox regression analyses, patients with higher HE4 serum levels (ie, HE4 ≥130 pmol/L) vs lower serum levels (ie, HE4 <130 pmol/L) had increased risk of all-cause mortality (adjusted HR: 3.26 [95% CI: 2.04-5.20], P < 0.001), and of the composite endpoint (adjusted HR: 2.48 [95% CI: 1.64-3.74], P < 0.001) following TAVI, respectively. Patients with higher HE4 serum levels had higher median native T1 mapping values (1,278 [95% CI: 1,239-1,280] ms vs 1,352 [95% CI: 1,303-1,376] ms, P < 0.001) at 1 to 3 months following the procedure.\nCONCLUSIONS: Elevated HE4 serum levels are associated with diffuse myocardial fibrosis and increased risk of adverse clinical events following TAVI.

6812eb4d4ef6922f6d69072e,40283521,Aortic Stenosis: Time for a Sex-Based Approach?,"Aortic stenosis (AS) is a progressive form of valvular heart disease most commonly associated with aging, with an exponential increase in prevalence after age 50. While men have historically been considered at higher risk, recent studies highlight a similar prevalence between men and women, with a higher prevalence in elderly women driven by longer life expectancy. Sex-related differences in clinical presentation, anatomy, and pathophysiology influence disease progression, severity assessment, and management. Women are often diagnosed at more advanced stages, exhibiting more pronounced symptoms, typically dyspnea and functional impairment, whereas men more often report chest pain. Women have a smaller body surface area, leading to smaller aortic annuli, left ventricular outflow tracts, aortic roots impacting flow dynamic, and severity grading. Diagnostic challenge contributes to the undertreatment of women. Despite experiencing severe AS, women receive fewer interventions and face delays in treatment. The advent of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) improved outcomes, with studies suggesting a potential advantage in women compared to men. However, the anatomical differences, such as smaller annuli and more tortuous vascular access, necessitate tailored procedural approaches. Recognizing these sex-specific differences is essential to optimizing AS management, ensuring timely interventions, and improving patient outcomes. Future strategies should incorporate sex-specific thresholds for diagnosis and treatment while leveraging technological advancements, such as artificial intelligence, for personalized therapeutic decisions.",Aurelia Zimmerli,Quentin Liabot,Georgios Tzimas,Mariama Akodad,Adil Salihu,Victor Weerts,Panagiotis Antiochos,Stephanie L Sellers,Pierre Monney,Olivier Muller,Stephane Fournier,David Meier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal of clinical medicine,2025-04-15,10.3390/jcm14082691,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm14082691,PMC12028251,Free,14,8,,AS Time for a Sex Based Approach?

6812eb674ef6922f6d690730,40263218,Proximal stent migration during coarctation of aorta stenting.,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter stenting has become the preferred treatment for native and recurrent coarctation of aorta (CoA), but complications such as stent migration occur in approximately 5% of cases. Proximal stent migration is particularly challenging and often requires surgical intervention. This report highlights the successful transcatheter management of proximal stent migration during CoA stenting in a high-risk patient.\nCASE PRESENTATION: A 22-year-old woman with Turner syndrome and chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP) presented with severe native CoA and refractory hypertension. Echocardiography revealed severe left ventricular hypertrophy and bicuspid aortic valve with mild aortic stenosis. The CoA segment gradient was 90 mmHg. During stent implantation using a 16 × 44 mm Zephyr stent mounted on an Atlas balloon, the stent migrated proximally into the right brachiocephalic artery despite appropriate crimping and hypotensive pacing. The stent was stabilized using a pigtail catheter via the right radial artery, and a low-profile peripheral balloon was inflated distal to the stent to pull the system back. However, the stent became stuck at the tightest segment of the CoA. Predilation of the CoA site with a larger balloon widened the segment, allowing the stent to be repositioned and deployed successfully. Post-procedure, the gradient across the CoA decreased to less than 5 mmHg. The patient was discharged after two days without complications, and follow-up imaging confirmed proper stent placement without restenosis.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our case illustrates the transcatheter management of proximal stent migration during CoA stenting, potentially reducing the need for surgical intervention. A stepwise strategy involving stent stabilization, low-profile balloon-assisted repositioning, and predilation of tight CoA segments can facilitate successful stent repositioning. This case contributes to the existing literature by documenting the occurrence and management of this rare complication.",Aamir Rashid,Vamiq Rasool,Jan Mohammad,Imran Hafeez,Shahood Ajaz,Hilal Rather,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The Egyptian heart journal : (EHJ) : official bulletin of the Egyptian Society of Cardiology,2025-04-22,10.1186/s43044-025-00637-z,https://doi.org/10.1186/s43044-025-00637-z,PMC12014972,Free,77,1,40,Proximal stent migration during coarctation of aorta stenting RASHID 2025,pdfs\Proximal stent migration during coarctation of aorta stenting RASHID 2025.pdf,stent,Proximal stent migration,CoA,stent migration,Proximal stent,CoA segment,segment,CoA stenting,balloon,migration,2025-04-30,approved,,CoA stenting,Proximal migration,Transcatheter,,,,,,,,

The Lifetech™ Konar-Multifunctional Occluder (MFO) VSD occluder has gained increasing application due to its versatility and promising outcomes.\nOBJECTIVES: We aim to evaluate our experience with the MFO device for VSD closure.\nMETHODS: We conducted a prospective analysis of clinical data from 151 patients who underwent percutaneous closure of muscular and perimembranous VSDs using the MFO device at our institution between November 2018 and September 2023. Comprehensive assessments of safety and procedural outcomes were performed.\nRESULTS: The patient's mean age was 55.4 ± 51.6 months (range, 6 months to 31 years), and the mean weight was 17.6 ± 11.9 kg (range, 5-86). Among the patients, 94 (62.3%) had perimembranous defects, while the remaining had muscular VSDs. The mean defect diameter was 4.8 ± 1.5 mm (range, 2-10). The retrograde approach was applied in 133 patients (88.7%). Device implantation was successful in 98.7% of patients. One procedure (0.7%) failed due to device migration, requiring surgical retrieval and VSD closure, and another patient with a significant residual shunt needed placement of an additional device in another session. The mean procedure time was 44 ± 2 min, with a mean fluoroscopy time of 12.8 ± 7.7 min. The mean follow-up duration was 11 ± 9.7 months (range, 6-35). Non-significant shunts were found in 32 patients (21.2%). Newly acquired valve regurgitation was observed in 16 patients (10.6%), including 11 patients (7.3%) with trivial-to-mild aortic regurgitation and 5 (3.3%) with moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation. Electrophysiological adverse events occurred in 5 patients (3.3%), including nodal rhythm (n = 3, 2%), intermittent heart block (n = 1, 0.7%), and severe bradycardia (n = 1, 0.7%). Vascular complications were documented in 13 patients (8.6%) including one developing chronic vascular occlusion.\nCONCLUSION: Percutaneous VSD closure with the MFO device is a safe, effective, and feasible procedure via both antegrade and retrograde approaches.",Abdelrahman Elafifi,Susy Kotit,Mahmoud Shehata,Omar Deyaa,Asmaa Ramadan,Mohammad Tawfik,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Frontiers in pediatrics,2025-04-30,10.3389/fped.2025.1528490,https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2025.1528490,PMC12009802,Free,13,,1528490,Early experience with transcatheter ventricular septal defects closure with the KONAR MF multifunctional occluder ELAFIFI 2025,pdfs\Early experience with transcatheter ventricular septal defects closure with the KONAR MF multifunctional occluder ELAFIFI 2025.pdf,VSD closure,MFO device,Percutaneous VSD closure,VSD,closure,VSDs,MFO,patients,device,muscular VSDs,2025-04-30,approved,,Konar MF,VSD,muscular VSD,percutaneous VSD closure,perimembranous VSD,ventricular septal defect,,,,,

6812eb744ef6922f6d690734,40258459,Association of Body Mass Index with Procedural Success and Outcomes in Patients undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.,"BACKGROUND: Obesity is a major public health concern linked to adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Recent studies suggest an obesity paradox, showing lower mortality in obese patients after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). This study investigates the impact of body mass index (BMI) on procedural and long-term clinical outcomes in patients undergoing TAVI.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients undergoing TAVI at two high-volume centers were analyzed and categorized into four BMI groups: underweight (BMI <18.5 kg/m2), normal (BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/m2), overweight (BMI 25.0-29.9 kg/m2), and obese (BMI ≥30.0 kg/m2). To relax the proportional hazards assumption, restricted cubic splines were constructed. The primary outcome was procedural success and safety, including 30-day all-cause-mortality, stroke, and overall bleeding. Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality at one and five years.\nRESULTS: 6,156 patients were included: 114 (1.8%) were underweight, 2393 (38.8%) normal weight, 2380 (38.6%) overweight, and 1269 (20.6%) obese. No significant differences between BMI groups were found in 30-day mortality, stroke, or bleeding. However, underweight patients had higher mortality compared to normal-weight patients at one year (23.7 vs. 13.2%, p=0.001) and five years (53.2% vs. 44.0%, p=0.048). Obese patients had similar mortality to normal-weight patients at one year (11.4 vs. 13.2%, p=0.120) and five years (41.0 vs. 44.0%, p=0.200).\nCONCLUSIONS: Obesity showed no outcome advantage over normal weight, while underweight was an independent predictor of higher all-cause mortality after TAVI.

Additional sedatives and analgesics may be required to prevent body movements; this would increase the risk of upper airway obstruction and of respiratory depression. We report a frail patient with hypoxemia and hiccups, in whom high-flow nasal oxygenation facilitated TAVI by effectively inhibiting body movements and respiratory complications.\nCASE PRESENTATION: In an 82-year-old patient with severe aortic stenosis, heart failure, hypoxemia, and hiccups, TAVI was planned under sedation with dexmedetomidine, fentanyl, and ketamine. High-flow nasal oxygenation effectively prevented hiccups and associated body movements, and prevented upper airway obstruction and respiratory depression, during TAVI.\nCONCLUSIONS: High-flow nasal oxygenation therapy is potentially useful during cardiac catheterization procedure under monitored anesthesia care, in elderly frail patients with reduced cardiopulmonary function.",Ryosuke Osawa,Takero Arai,Takashi Asai,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JA clinical reports,2025-04-21,10.1186/s40981-025-00784-x,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40981-025-00784-x,PMC12011683,Free,11,1,22,High flow oxygenation therapy for a sedated elderly frail patient with hiccups undergoing TAVI OSAWA 2025,pdfs\High flow oxygenation therapy for a sedated elderly frail patient with hiccups undergoing TAVI OSAWA 2025.pdf,high-flow nasal oxygenation,high-flow nasal,transcatheter aortic valve,nasal oxygenation,body movements,aortic valve implantation,aortic valve,TAVI,upper airway obstruction,nasal oxygenation therapy,2025-04-30,approved,,Conscious sedation,High-flow nasal oxygenation therapy,Transcatheter aortic valve implantation,,,,,,,,
6812eb804ef6922f6d690736,40248303,Aortic and mitral structural interventions in the absence of cardiac surgery.,"Traditionally, structural heart interventions have been performed at heart valve centres with on-site heart surgery to maximize expertise and deal with complications requiring emergent cardiac surgery (ECS). However, at present, only transcatheter aortic-valve implantation (TAVI) must be performed at centres with on-site heart surgery according to current guidelines, while mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair, or left appendage atrial occlusion could be performed also in centres without on-site cardiac surgery. Today, ageing of the population and improved results of TAVI have increased the need for such procedures posing strong pressure to traditional heart valve centres, prolonging waiting times for TAVI and increasing access disparities. Fortunately, TAVI procedures have a very low rate of complications, including those necessitating ECS, and observational data suggest that TAVI can be safely performed in centres without on-site cardiac surgery. However, guideline recommendations need randomized clinical trials like the TRanscatheter Aortic-Valve Implantation with or without on-site Cardiac Surgery (TRACS) trial to be updated. The TRACS trial randomizes high-risk symptomatic aortic stenosis patients to treatment by the same operators either at centres with or without on-site cardiac surgery and compares 1-year follow-up. Key issues for structural interventions, in particular TAVI, at centres without on-site surgery are shared indications through heart team evaluation, consistent experiences and competences of non-surgical centres, and strong networking with the Hub centre. The increasing demand for structural heart interventions highlights the need for innovative care models and the careful introduction of a 'Hub-and-Spoke' approach for high-volume heart valve networks could be a study option.",Gianmarco Iannopollo,Alessandro Capecchi,Roberto Verardi,Luigi Biasco,Chiara Pedone,Valerio Lanzilotti,Matteo Bruno,Giampiero Nobile,Gianni Casella,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,European heart journal supplements : journal of the European Society of Cardiology,2025-03-30,10.1093/eurheartjsupp/suaf038,https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartjsupp/suaf038,PMC12001765,Free,27,Suppl 3,iii64-iii68,Aortic and mitral structural interventions in the absence of cardiac surgery IANNOPOLLO 2025,pdfs\Aortic and mitral structural interventions in the absence of cardiac surgery IANNOPOLLO 2025.pdf,on-site cardiac surgery,on-site heart surgery,cardiac surgery,TAVI,on-site cardiac,heart valve centres,surgery,structural heart interventions,heart,heart surgery,2025-04-30,,,Heart surgery,TAVI,TEER,,,,,,,,
6812eb854ef6922f6d690737,40248294,Discordance between aortic valve gradient and area: do I trust the significant gradient?,"Aortic stenosis is an increasingly relevant pathology not only for its high prevalence in the population (especially elderly), but also because in recent decades traditional surgery has been accompanied by transcatheter aortic valve implantation, a technique that has allowed a significant increase in effective therapeutic procedures, even in patients previously considered at high surgical risk. It has become essential to make precise diagnoses, based mainly on echo-Doppler that allows to identify the aetiology and severity of the valvular disease. A stenosis is considered severe when the area is <1 cm2, the mean gradient exceeds 40 mmHg and the peak velocity is >4 m/s. Although in many cases these cut-offs are decisive, in others a discrepancy between area (<1 cm2) and gradient (<40 mmHg) is observed, requiring the inclusion of other variables such as ejection fraction (EF > or <50%) and the systolic volume index (normal SVi >35 mL/m2 or reduced <35 mL/m2) to define the severity of the stenosis. This article describes the reasons for this discrepancy, identifies echo-Doppler parameters that further improve the classification of stenosis severity, and defines the indications for second-level examinations such as computed tomography and transoesophageal echocardiography.",Manuela Muratori,Ali Sarah Ghulam,Paola Gripari,Laura Fusini,Francesco Cannata,Gianluca Pontone,Mauro Pepi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,European heart journal supplements : journal of the European Society of Cardiology,2025-03-30,10.1093/eurheartjsupp/suaf027,https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartjsupp/suaf027,PMC12001774,Free,27,Suppl 3,iii111-iii116,Discordance between aortic valve gradient and area do I trust the significant gradient?

We hypothesized that a heart failure with preserved ejection fraction phenotype in aortic stenosis is associated with earlier onset of symptoms and reduced symptomatic response after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: This retrospective cohort study included 469 patients with moderate aortic stenosis. We determined heavy, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary, elder, filling pressure (H2FPEF) score at diagnosis and compared aortic peak jet velocity at onset of dyspnea in patients with low (<6) and high (≥6) H2FPEF score. In a separate cohort of 601 patients undergoing TAVI, we compared New York Heart Association class, NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide), and cardiovascular mortality post-TAVI between patients with low and high H2FPEF scores. In patients with aortic stenosis and a high H2FPEF score (n=43, 9.2%), the median peak jet velocity at onset of dyspnea was 4.2 versus 4.4 m/s in patients with a low H2FPEF score (P<0.001). After TAVI, a high H2FPEF score (n=123, 20%) was associated with a lower proportion of New York Heart Association class I at 30 days (49% versus 61%; P=0.04), persistently elevated NT-proBNP, and higher 5-year rate of cardiovascular mortality (36% versus 30%; P=0.012), compared with a low H2FPEF score.\nCONCLUSIONS: Patients with aortic stenosis with a heart failure with preserved ejection fraction phenotype are more likely to develop symptoms at lower gradients and have worse outcomes post-TAVI.

HAD is a significant concern affecting older adults undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: This retrospective study investigated 243 consecutive patients who underwent elective transfemoral TAVI between January 2016 and April 2022. HAD was defined as a decrease of at least 1 point in the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) assessed before discharge compared with before TAVI. Logistic regression identified the first ambulation day after TAVI as an independent predictor of HAD incidence (odds ratio 1.500; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.115-2.008; P=0.007). Patients with HAD had significantly lower body mass index, hemoglobin, and albumin, and higher serum creatinine. All-cause mortality was significantly higher in patients with than without HAD (log-rank P<0.001). Kaplan-Meier analysis confirmed poorer survival in patients with HAD, regardless of the degree of decline in SPPB. Multivariate Cox analysis regression identified HAD as a predictor of all-cause death (hazard ratio 4.249; 95% CI 1.798-10.04; P<0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: The timing of the first ambulation was associated with the incidence of HAD.

During the follow-up period (mean 1,135 days), 13 (5.2%) patients died of cardiovascular disease. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) feature selection identified 8 features as important candidates, including old myocardial infarction, triglycerides/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TG/HDL-C) ratio, Society of Thoracic Surgeons predicted risk of mortality score (STS-PROM), pulse rate, left atrium volume index, stroke volume index, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and albumin. Cox regression analyses with adjustment for age and sex showed that old myocardial infarction, high levels of TG/HDL-C, STS-PROM, and pulse rate, as well as low levels of glomerular filtration rate and albumin, were independent risk factors for cardiovascular death. Models of logistic regression (LR) and random survival forest (RSF) using the LASSO-selected features, except for STS-PROM, significantly improved predictive abilities for cardiovascular death compared with LR analysis using STS-PROM alone.\nCONCLUSIONS: Machine learning models of prediction for cardiovascular death of LR and RSF using the LASSO-selected features are superior to a LR model using STS-PROM alone in patients with severe AS who underwent TAVI.",Shunsaku Otomo,Itaru Hosaka,Marenao Tanaka,Naoto Murakami,Nobuaki Kokubu,Atsuko Muranaka,Ryo Nishikawa,Naoki Hachiro,Ryota Kawamura,Jun Nakata,Nobutaka Nagano,Yukinori Akiyama,Tatsuya Sato,Yutaka Iba,Toshiyuki Yano,Nobuyoshi Kawaharada,Masato Furuhashi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Circulation reports,2025-04-10,10.1253/circrep.CR-24-0182,https://doi.org/10.1253/circrep.CR-24-0182,PMC11981669,Free,7,4,293-302,Construction of Predictive Models for Cardiovascular Mortality by Machine Learning Approaches in Pts Who Underwent TAVI OTOMO 2025,pdfs\Construction of Predictive Models for Cardiovascular Mortality by Machine Learning Approaches in Pts Who Underwent TAVI OTOMO 2025.pdf,cardiovascular death,underwent TAVI,Cardiovascular,TAVI,Transcatheter Aortic Valve,Patients,LASSO Feature Selection,Sapporo Medical University,death,Machine Learning,2025-04-30,rejected,,Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO),Machine learning,Random forest survival (RSF),SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP),Transcatheter aortic valve implantation,,,,,,

In this study, we aimed to assess changes in functional resting and hyperemic indices before and immediately after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) and their relationship with microvascular resistance.\nMETHODS: In this pooled analysis of 3 prospective observational studies, fractional flow reserve (FFR), resting full-cycle ratio (RFR), and resting Pd/Pa were measured in patients with severe aortic stenosis before and after TAVI in the left anterior descending artery. Coronary microcirculation was also assessed using thermodilution-based methods, with microvascular resistance reserve (cutoff ≤3) used to identify coronary microvascular dysfunction.\nRESULTS: A total of 126 patients were included. Baseline Pd/Pa, RFR, and FFR measurements were 0.93±0.04, 0.90±0.07, and 0.89±0.07, respectively. Immediately post-TAVI, a small but significant decrease was observed for both RFR and FFR (RFR, 0.88±0.08; FFR, 0.88±0.08; P<0.05 for all). Coronary flow reserve and microvascular resistance reserve also remained unchanged. Applying the established cutoff values, 16 (12.7%) vessels had a positive FFR, while a higher proportion of vessels were positive for Pd/Pa and RFR (35.7% and 43.7%, respectively; P<0.001). The concordance between pre- and post-TAVI FFR was higher (92.8%) compared with Pd/Pa (75.4%) and RFR (73.8%) (P<0.001 for both). The rate of disagreement between resting and hyperemic indices remained unchanged, regardless of the presence of coronary microvascular dysfunction.\nCONCLUSIONS: TAVI is associated with a small but significant reduction in FFR and RFR immediately post-procedure.

The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the 5-year outcomes of using the J-Valve for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in aortic stenosis (AS) and pure aortic regurgitation (AR).\nMETHODS: From March 2014 to August 2015, all consecutive patients with severe AS and pure AR treated with the J-Valve THV at three centers in China were prospectively enrolled in a clinical study. Clinical and echocardiographic follow-up were performed according to study protocol. All results were reported according to the Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC-3) criteria.\nRESULTS: At 5-year follow-up, the all-cause mortality rate was 15.31% (16/98), with a cardiovascular mortality rate of 7.14% (7/98). The incidence of stroke was 7.14% (7/98), the permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI) rate was 8.16% (8/98). Echocardiographic follow-up showed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) significantly improved at 5 years in both AS (58.98±10.45% vs. 61.78±9.07%, p for trend < 0.01) and pure AR (52.86±10.98% vs. 61.45±6.90%, p for trend < 0.01) patients. Structural or hemodynamic valve deterioration occurred in 3 cases (3.06%). 97.59% of patients had significant improvement in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class over the 5-year follow-up, which is associated with significant improvement in quality of life.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that TAVI with the J-Valve THV provides excellent 5-year clinical and echocardiographic outcomes, suggesting TAVI with a dedicated THV is a good alternative treatment for AS and pure AR in selected high-risk patients.",Yuqiang Wang,Lai Wei,Lulu Liu,Jun Shi,Wei Wang,Tingqian Cao,Chaoyi Qin,Jian Ye,Yingqiang Guo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,2025-04-07,10.1016/j.jtcvs.2025.03.036,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcvs.2025.03.036,,Paid,,,,A multicenter prospective clinical study on TAVI for AS or pure AR 5 year outcomes WANG 2025,Not available,pure aortic regurgitation,multicenter prospective clinical,aortic regurgitation,multicenter prospective,pure aortic,TAVI,aortic stenosis,aortic,pure,J-Valve THV,2025-04-30,,,aortic regurgitation,aortic stenosis,transcatheter aortic valve implantation,,,,,,,,

Preparation of such calcified CAD using rotational atherectomy (RA) in those patients with severe AS is controversial and may carry a high risk of complications. The authors aimed to compare in-hospital outcomes following RA in patients with severe AS before transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) vs patients without AS.\nMETHODS: The authors retrieved data from the Prospective Segeberg TAVI Registry from January 2016 to October 2021. All AS patients who underwent RA within 6 months prior to TAVI were included for our analysis and compared with patients without AS. In-hospital MACE, defined as cardiac mortality, myocardial infarction, and target lesion revascularization was evaluated in both groups.\nRESULTS: From a total of 472 patients who underwent RA, 38 (8.1%) patients had severe AS. The group with AS was older than the group without AS (84.4 ± 6.19 vs 75.2 ± 8.31; P less than .001). About one-fourth of the RA procedures in the patients with AS were performed for aorto-ostial lesions (26.3%). Slow flow was reported in 1 (2.6%) patient in AS group, but no perforation or trapped burr was reported. In-hospital major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) occurred in 41 (8.7%) patients and was comparable in both groups (7.9% in AS group vs 8.8% in non-AS group; P = .857). Furthermore, the presence of severe AS was not associated with occurrence of more in-hospital MACE following RA (OR 1.12: 95% CI, 0.33-3.81; P = .857). The cumulative rate of all-cause and cardiac mortality was higher in the AS group than in the non-AS group ((44.6% vs 22.2%, P = .002; 31.9% vs 17.2%, P = .017, respectively).\nCONCLUSIONS: RA for preparing heavily calcified coronary lesions in patients with severe AS showed comparable in-hospital outcomes to patients without severe AS.",Sultan Alotaibi,Abdelhakim Allai,Hajo Heyer,Nader Mankerious,Martin Landt,Mohamed Abdel-Wahab,Volker Geist,Ralph Tölg,Mohamed Samy,Gert Richardt,Karim Elbasha,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The Journal of invasive cardiology,2025-04-04,10.25270/jic/25.00007,https://doi.org/10.25270/jic/25.00007,,Paid,,,,Rotational atherectomy for calcified coronary lesions in sAS before TAVI ALOTAIBI 2025,Not available,severe aortic stenosis,calcified coronary lesions,calcified coronary,aortic valve implantation,transcatheter aortic valve,patients,severe,aortic stenosis,severe aortic,Prospective Segeberg TAVI,2025-04-30,,,TAVI,aortic stenosis,calficifed lesions,coronary artery disease,rotational atherectomy,severe aortic stenosis,,,,,

TAVI might reduce thrombin generation and fibrin clot resistance to lysis. We aimed to evaluate the predictive value of thrombin generation and clot lysis time on TAVI outcomes. We screened 135 patients referred for TAVI. Thrombin generation (lag time, time to peak, peak thrombin concentration, and endogenous thrombin potential) and clot lysis time were assessed before TAVI and at hospital discharge. Major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) including all-cause death, cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, transient ischemic attack, heart failure decompensation, and clinical valve thrombosis were assessed during 1-year follow-up. Among 70 patients who underwent TAVI, 14 (20%) experienced MACCE during the median follow-up of 361 days. Before TAVI, thrombin generation and clot lysis time were similar in patients with vs. without MACCE. Post-TAVI peak thrombin concentration was significantly lower in patients with MACCE (157.5 vs. 240.38 nM, p = 0.016), discriminated between those with and without MACCE (AUC: 0.773, p = 0.016), and was predictive for MACCE in both univariable (OR: 10.733, 95% CI: 1.197-96.283, p = 0.034) and multivariable (OR: 11.551, 95% CI: 1.104-120.828, p = 0.041) regression analyses. Pre-TAVI lag time was a predictor of MACCE in univariable regression analysis (OR: 5.304, 95% CI: 1.074-26.182, p = 0.041). Post-TAVI peak thrombin concentration and pre-TAVI lag time might potentially serve as novel predictors of MACCE in patients undergoing TAVI.",Aleksander Siniarski,Jakub Michal Zimodro,Aleksandra Gąsecka,Michał Łomiak,Marta Frydrych,Jadwiga Nessler,Grzegorz Gajos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal of thrombosis and thrombolysis,2025-04-05,10.1007/s11239-025-03090-6,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11239-025-03090-6,PMC10551823,Paid,,,,Thrombin generation and clot lysis time to predict outcomes in Pts undergoing TAVI SINIARSKI 2025,Not downloaded,aortic valve implantation,clot lysis time,transcatheter aortic valve,Thrombin generation,clot lysis,MACCE,TAVI,lysis time,Thrombin,transcatheter aortic,2025-04-30,,,Aortic stenosis,Fibrin clot,Fibrinolysis,Thrombin generation,Transcatheter aortic valve implantation,,,,,,

Aortic dissection typically results from procedural trauma to the aorta.\nCASE SUMMARY: We describe an iatrogenic aortic root dissection and contained aortic laceration during TAVI procedure with a 29-mm Evolut FX in an 88-year-old man with a history of coronary artery bypasses. Postprocedural computed tomography revealed a dissection in the noncoronary sinus of Valsalva with a mediastinal hematoma, evolving into a well defined pseudoaneurysm (20 mm). The patient received conservative management, resulting in a favorable clinical outcome.\nDISCUSSION: This case underscores the importance of preprocedural imaging, precise procedural execution, and close postprocedural monitoring.

6812eb9f4ef6922f6d690743,40175206,Fractional Flow Reserve Versus Angiography-Guided Revascularisation in Patients With Severe Aortic Stenosis: A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND: Aortic stenosis (AS) and coronary artery disease usually coexist in older adults. Although fractional flow reserve (FFR) is the gold standard for demonstrating functionally significant coronary artery stenoses, its efficacy in patients with severe AS awaiting transcatheter aortic valve implantation is unclear. This systematic review assesses the clinical outcomes between FFR- and angiography-guided coronary revascularisation in patients with severe AS.\nMETHOD: This review conformed to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases were searched until 12 March 2024. Eligible studies included randomised controlled trials or observational studies including patients with severe AS with concurrent coronary disease comparing FFR- with angiography-guided percutaneous coronary intervention. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and myocardial infarction. Secondary outcomes were composite major adverse cardiovascular events.\nRESULTS: Five retrospective cohort studies were identified, including 1,927 patients. The average follow-up was 34.7 months. FFR-guided cohorts exhibited higher incidence rates for all-cause mortality (17.4% vs 15.6%), myocardial infarction (4.4% vs 3.3%), and major adverse cardiovascular events (21.8% vs 18.5%) than the angiography-guided cohorts. A total of 32.8% the angiography-guided cohort and 33.1% from the FFR-guided cohort underwent percutaneous coronary intervention. Due to insufficient power and inconsistency of the available data (including heterogenous patient selection criteria, differences in procedural protocols, anatomical distribution of stented lesions, non-uniform reporting of measured outcomes), a meta-analysis for the primary and secondary outcomes was not conducted. The methodological quality of the included studies was found to be of fair quality according to the Newcastle-Ottawa checklist.\nCONCLUSIONS: Despite the recognised usefulness of FFR in the assessment of coronary artery disease, its clinical efficacy in patients with severe AS undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation remains uncertain amidst inconclusive observational data.

The aim of this analysis is to develop a simple and effective risk prediction model for PPMI within 30 days of TAVI. Data from 370 patients who underwent TAVI with the self-expanding valve between February 2015 and June 2022 at our center were collected in the development cohort (DC). A risk score was developed based on baseline anatomical and electrocardiographic characteristics, including the estimation of aortic calcium load (ACL) using both the Agatston score and calcium volume. A validation cohort (VC) of 234 patients was used to test the score. Seventy-two patients (19.5%) underwent PPMI in DC. Preprocedural right bundle branch block (RBBB), membranous septum length (MSL) <5 mm, and severe ACL were significant predictors of PPMI. The Agatston score showed higher agreement with PPMI compared to calcium volume (K = 0.89; 95% CI 0.84 to 0.93 vs K = 0.71; 95% CI 0.64 to 0.79, respectively). Pre-existing RBBB, MSL, and Agatston score have been combined into a simple score, called RITMO (theoretical range from -1 to 4 points). We applied the score to the VC and find that a high score (>1) had an OR>6 to predict PPMI after TAVI. In patients undergoing TAVI with a self-expanding valve, baseline RBBB, shorter MSL, and higher ACL evaluated using the Agatston method were predictive of 30-day PPMI. In conclusion, the RITMO score represents a simple tool for risk stratification, with implications for procedural planning and patient counseling.",Giulia Costa,Marco Angelillis,Cristina Giannini,Matteo Mazzola,Chiara Primerano,Giulia Brandi,Paolo Spontoni,Laura Stazzoni,Anna Sonia Petronio,Marco De Carlo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The American journal of cardiology,2025-03-31,10.1016/j.amjcard.2025.03.028,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjcard.2025.03.028,,Paid,248,,1-9,A Combined Electrocardiographic and Imaging Predictive Risk Model for New Permanent Pacemaker After TAVI The RITMO Score COSTA 2025,Not available,permanent pacemaker implantation,Aortic Valve Implantation,Transcatheter Aortic Valve,Imaging Predictive Risk,Permanent Pacemaker,Transcatheter Aortic,Valve Implantation,pacemaker implantation,Imaging Predictive,Aortic Valve,2025-04-30,,,aortic stenosis,multislice computed tomography,permanent pacemaker implantation,transcatheter aortic valve implantation,,,,,,,
6812eba14ef6922f6d690745,40174696,Major Intraprocedural Complications During Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation Requiring Emergent Cardiac Surgery: An Updated Systematic Review.,"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an established treatment for patients >75 years old with severe aortic stenosis. From the technique's beginnings in the early 2000s, over 20 years of experience in the TAVI procedure have allowed its wide diffusion with optimal procedural results. Intraprocedural complications during TAVI are yet a fearful scenario, sometimes requiring emergent open-heart surgery (EOHS) that is burdened by high intraoperative mortality (50% at 30 days). Furthermore, also when a surgical treatment is not needed, intraprocedural complications have a challenging management and a critical impact on patients' prognosis. The volume of procedures in the last 10 years has been observed to increase substantially, with an incidence of major intraprocedural complications of around 1%. However, the features and specific incidence for each complication have not been revised recently. This work aims to update the knowledge about major intraprocedural complications during TAVI, considering the increased operators' experience and recent device developments. An updated point of view on major intraprocedural complications could suggest a need for change in the TAVI paradigm, promoting TAVI programs even in centers without on-site cardiac surgery.",Giuseppe Verolino,Michele Di Mauro,Dario Calderone,Roberto Lorusso,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The American journal of cardiology,2025-03-31,10.1016/j.amjcard.2025.03.031,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjcard.2025.03.031,,Paid,247,,21-28,Major Intraprocedural Complications During TAVI Requiring Emergent Cardiac Surgery An Updated Systematic Review VEROLINO 2025,Not available,Updated Systematic Review,Transcatheter Aortic Valve,Aortic Valve Implantation,Systematic Review,Valve Implantation Requiring,Major Intraprocedural Complications,Intraprocedural Complications,Valve Implantation,Aortic Valve,Transcatheter Aortic,2025-04-30,,,TAVI,bailout surgery,emergent open-heart surgery,major intraprocedural complications,on-site cardiac surgery,severe aortic stenosis,,,,,

Our goal was to determine whether trans-catheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an effective treatment option for severe aortic stenosis patients with rheumatic valvular disease. This study is a prospective cohort study that includes a total of 54 rheumatic severe aortic stenosis patients who were referred for TAVI. The age ranged from 65.00 to 83.00 years (mean age 72.75 ± 5.86 years). Notably, 63% of the patients had undergone preimplantation balloon dilatation. The outcomes included total new conduction disturbances (transient and permanent defects of atrio-ventricular block and left bundle branch block) in 31.4% of the patients, permanent pacemaker implantation in 3.7%, and valve embolization in 1.85%, and no patients had moderate to severe para-valvular leak. All-cause death within a 6-month follow-up was 3.7%. This cohort was then compared to a propensity score matched group of degenerative calcific severe aortic stenosis of 54 cases revealing comparable post-procedural results. Compared with the outcomes of TAVI in patients with degenerative aortic stenosis, TAVI represents a viable and durable option for rheumatic severe aortic stenosis patients.",Ahmed Abdelrahman Elkaialy,Nabil Farag,Ahmad Elsayed Mostafa,Mahmoud Baraka,Diaa Kamal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cardiovascular intervention and therapeutics,2025-03-31,10.1007/s12928-025-01113-w,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12928-025-01113-w,PMC5523449,Paid,,,,TAVI in elderly Pts with sAS and rheumatic phenotype ELKAIALY 2025,Not downloaded,severe aortic stenosis,aortic stenosis,aortic stenosis patients,Transcatheter aortic valve,severe aortic,aortic,aortic valve implantation,aortic valve,patients,stenosis,2025-04-30,,,Aortic stenosis,Rheumatic,Transcatheter aortic valve implantation,,,,,,,,

However, data regarding the choice of valve type in ViV-TAVI remain inconclusive. This meta-analysis compares the procedural and clinical outcomes of self-expanding (SE) vs. balloon-expandable (BE) valves in ViV-TAVI. MEDLINE and Scopus were queried to identify studies reporting outcomes of ViV-TAVI by SE/BE valve type or comparing outcomes between SE or BE valves for ViV-TAVI. The primary outcome was incidence of all-cause mortality at 30 days. Data were presented as incidence of outcomes, analyzed via random effects model using inverse variance method with 95 % confidence intervals. Further incidence rates of primary and secondary outcomes were presented as subgroups of BE and SE, with comparison in incidence rates between the subgroups made using p-interaction of proportions. 27 studies with 13,182 patients (SE: 7346; BE: 5836) were included. There were no significant differences between the BE vs. SE valves in 30-day mortality (BE 4 % vs. SE 3 %, p = 0.44), 1-year mortality (BE 12 % vs. SE 10 %, p = 0.60), and moderate-to-severe AR at 1 year (BE 1 % vs. SE 3 %, p = 0.36). However, patients with SE valves had higher rates of new permanent pacemaker insertion (BE 4 % vs. SE 9 %, p = 0.0019). There were no significant differences in the incidence of 30-day safety outcomes, including stroke, AKI, coronary obstruction, major bleeding, and major vascular complications. Both BE and SE valve types showed comparable mortality and safety outcomes in ViV-TAVI, except pacemaker insertion, which was higher in SE compared with BE valves.",Farah Yasmin,Abdul Moeed,Kinza Iqbal,Abraish Ali,Ashish Kumar,Jawad Basit,Mohammad Hamza,Sourbha S Dani,Ankur Kalra,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,International journal of cardiology.

6812ebc44ef6922f6d69074f,39663714,Management of acute decompensated valvular heart disease.,"Worldwide, valvular heart disease (VHD) is a common cause of hospitalization for acute heart failure. In acute heart failure caused by VHD, symptoms result from rapid haemodynamic changes and subsequent decline in cardiac function, and if left untreated, leads to acute decompensation and cardiogenic shock. Current evidence remains scarce and recommendations regarding the management of acute heart failure caused by VHD are lacking in most recent international guidelines. Herein, we review the management of acute heart failure caused by VHD with a focus on transcatheter therapies and describe currently available evidence based on a systematic literature search on the following valve pathologies: (i) aortic stenosis, (ii) aortic regurgitation, (iii) mitral regurgitation, and (iv) mitral stenosis. Articles reporting outcomes following urgent or emergent valve intervention in the setting of cardiogenic shock or acute heart failure were considered. After screening a total of 2234 articles, 76 published between 1994 and 2023 were included in subsequent analysis. Based on available evidence, proposed treatment algorithms to guide optimal management of acute heart failure caused by VHD were created. As the number of patients presenting with acute heart failure caused by VHD continues to rise and outcomes following transcatheter valve interventions continue to improve, it is inevitable that minimally invasive options will play an increasingly important role in the acute setting, especially given these patients are at an increased operative risk. This review aims to present an organized approach to the complex management and interventional treatment of patients with acute heart failure caused by VHD.",Enzo Lüsebrink,Hugo Lanz,Antonia Kellnar,Nicole Karam,Samir Kapadia,Raj Makkar,William T Abraham,Azeem Latib,Martin Leon,Anna Sannino,Mony Shuvy,Mayra Guerrero,Neil Fam,Javed Butler,Marianna Adamo,Volker Rudolph,Gilbert H L Tang,Thomas J Stocker,Karl-Philipp Rommel,Philipp Lurz,Holger Thiele,Steffen Massberg,Fabien Praz,Bernard Prendergast,Jörg Hausleiter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,European journal of heart failure,2025-04-30,10.1002/ejhf.3549,https://doi.org/10.1002/ejhf.3549,,Paid,27,4,630-649,Management of acute decompensated valvular heart disease LÜSEBRINK 2025,Not available,acute heart failure,heart failure caused,heart failure,valvular heart disease,acute heart,failure caused,caused by VHD,decompensated valvular heart,heart,VHD,2025-04-30,rejected,,Acute decompensated heart failure,Valvular heart disease,,,,,,,,,

6812ebd74ef6922f6d690751,40257595,Characteristics of cardiac rehabilitation progress during hospitalization and in-hospital outcomes after mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair.,"Mitral regurgitation is a prevalent cardiac valvular disease, and its incidence is increasing with the aging population. While surgical intervention has traditionally been the standard treatment for this disease, in Japan, mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (M-TEER) has emerged as a less invasive alternative since 2018. M-TEER demonstrates promising outcomes in reducing postoperative complications and shortening hospital stays. However, scarce data on cardiac rehabilitation (CR) following M-TEER is available. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the characteristics of CR progress during hospitalization and in-hospital outcomes following M-TEER. This single-center, retrospective cohort study involved 244 patients who underwent M-TEER at the Sakakibara Heart Institute between April 2018 and March 2023. Data on progress in CR and in-hospital outcomes, including hospitalization-associated disability (HAD), rate of return to home, and hospitalization that extended beyond 30 days after M-TEER, were collected. After excluding patients who met the exclusion criteria-including conversion to surgical mitral valve replacement or the absence of CR during hospitalization-233 patients were included in the analysis. The patients' median age was 81 years, with 48.5% being female. In 43% of cases, the hospitalizations were unplanned. Ambulation was initiated at a median of 1 day after M-TEER, with 88.4% of patients being able to commence ambulation as early as 2 days after M-TEER. However, only 19.3% engaged in aerobic exercise using equipment in the CR room. The median length of stay following M-TEER was 6 days, with 4.7% of hospitalizations resulting in a stay of 30 days or more. Ultimately, 90.6% of patients were discharged home, with an incidence of HAD of 9.9%. Compared to the planned hospitalization group, the unplanned hospitalization group had a significantly lower rate of early postoperative ambulation (planned hospitalization group: 97.7% vs. unplanned hospitalization group: 76.2%, p < 0.01), a higher proportion of patients with hospital stays exceeding 30 days (0% vs. 10.9%, p < 0.01), a lower rate of home discharge (98.5% vs. 80.2%, p < 0.01), and an increased incidence of HAD (0.8% vs. 22.2%, p < 0.01). M-TEER provides a minimally invasive treatment option for mitral regurgitation with favorable early rehabilitation and in-hospital outcomes, particularly in planned hospitalization.

6812ebee4ef6922f6d690757,40191633,Dysphagia following transcatheter mitral valve-in-ring replacement complicated by neo-left ventricular outflow tract obstruction: a case report.,"BACKGROUND: Neo-left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction is a dreaded complication following transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR). Dynamic LVOT obstruction has been reported to cause mechanical intravascular haemolysis due to red cell fragmentation. Intravascular haemolysis can result in a rare but well-described phenomenon in which patients experience dysphagia due to oesophageal spasm. This phenomenon is classically associated with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria and has never been reported following TMVR.\nCASE SUMMARY: A 77-year-old female presented 8 days following TMVR with presyncope, dyspnoea, and severe dysphagia. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed neo-LVOT obstruction with trivial paravalvular mitral regurgitation. Doppler echocardiography revealed dynamic late-peaking LVOT obstruction with a peak gradient of 71 mmHg with Valsalva manoeuvre. Laboratory investigations demonstrated intravascular haemolytic anaemia. A barium swallow was performed revealing severe diffuse oesophageal spasm. Alternative causes of dysphagia were excluded, and a causal link between intravascular haemolysis and dysphagia was identified. Successful management of dynamic neo-LVOT obstruction, haemolytic anaemia, and dysphagia was achieved with beta blocker therapy and volume resuscitation. Serial echocardiography and barium swallow performed prior to discharge demonstrated resolution of LVOT obstruction and marked reduction in oesophageal spasm.\nDISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this is the first case report of TMVR complicated by reversible neo-LVOT obstruction with only trivial paravalvular regurgitation causing intravascular haemolysis and subsequent dysphagia. The management of dysphagia secondary to intravascular haemolysis due to neo-LVOT obstruction is challenging. This is because of the complex haemodynamic interplay between reduced oral intake, a high output state with anaemia, increased ventricular contractility, tachycardia, and worsening dynamic obstruction, all part of a vicious cycle (Summary figure).",Stephanie Sargent,Eddy Xiong,Katherine Lau,Owen Christopher Raffel,Kim Greaves,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,European heart journal.

The transcatheter valve was positioned and deployed through a partial dehiscence on the anterior aspect of the prosthetic ring, probably caused by the balloon valvuloplasty or undetected in the preprocedural imaging assessment. This led to prosthetic ring detachment and dislocation, native annular tearing, migration of the transcatheter prosthesis, and subsequent hemodynamic collapse requiring open surgery.\nPOTENTIAL PITFALLS: In TMVR, prosthesis misalignment or malposition may cause annular stress during deployment and tearing of the native annulus, prosthesis embolization from suboptimal anchoring, and cardiac tamponade from left ventricular rupture, often requiring emergency surgical intervention.",Andrés Felipe Ochoa-Díaz,María Carolina Manzur-Barbur,Luis Enrique Giraldo,Nicolas Ariza-Ordoñez,Yilmar Meza-González,Darío Echeverri,Jaime Cabrales,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JACC.

6812ebf14ef6922f6d69075b,40109243,Transcatheter Mitral Valve Replacement With Atrial Fixation for Treatment of Atrial Functional Mitral Regurgitation.,"BACKGROUND: Many patients with atrial functional mitral regurgitation are not suitable candidates for surgery or transcatheter repair. For transcatheter mitral valve replacement, a common contraindication is the risk of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, particularly in patients with atrial functional mitral regurgitation, who have characteristically small left ventricles. Herein, we examine the outcomes of transcatheter mitral valve replacement using the AltaValve system, which employs atrial fixation thus minimizing left ventricular outflow tract obstruction risk.\nMETHODS: Patients with severe, symptomatic mitral regurgitation who were treated in the AltaValve early feasibility study or on the basis of a compassionate use exemption. The definition of atrial functional mitral regurgitation required the presence of: (1) severe mitral regurgitation; (2) atrial fibrillation; (3) normal left ventricular size; (4) left ventricular ejection fraction ≥50%; and (5) absence of organic mitral disease. Procedural outcomes, 30-day survival, and echo findings are reported.\nRESULTS: Fourteen patients (71% women, mean age 77.9 years, Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality score 5.4%) were treated, including 11 via transseptal delivery and 3 via a transapical approach. Technical success and mitral regurgitation reduction from severe to none/trace were achieved in all cases. There were no cases of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. All-cause mortality at 30 days was 14% (2/14). Class III/IV New York Heart Association status was reduced from 79% at baseline to 0% at 30 days. At 30 days, 11 of 12 surviving patients had an available echocardiogram; mitral regurgitation severity was trace/none in 90.9% (10/11) and mild in 9.1% (1/11).\nCONCLUSIONS: The AltaValve system shows promising early procedural and clinical results for the unique anatomy of patients with atrial functional mitral regurgitation. Long-term clinical studies to demonstrate the benefit of this system are warranted.",John T Saxon,Philippe Genereux,Vlasis Ninios,Thomas Waggoner,Naeem Tahirkheli,Marek Grygier,Krzysztof Wrobel,Matti Adam,Georg Nickenig,Tsuyoshi Kaneko,Paul Sorajja,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Circulation.

ASA was the first choice technique to reduce this risk based on multiple and staged cardiac CT screening.\nRESULTS: Out of 29 consecutive TMVR procedures conducted in our center between March 2021 and April 2023, nine patients presented high LVOTO risk and were enrolled in our study. The main risk factor retained was a reduced predicted NeoLVOT surface 89 mm2 [66-135] (< 170 mm2). Most procedures were valve in MAC and all patients underwent at least one ASA. CT control showed a significant increase by 95% in the predicted NeoLVOT surface: 174 mm2 [121-240]; p = 0.012 compared to the baseline value. There were no significant paraprosthesis leakage or LVOTO found on TTE according to the MVARC criteria. Cardiac CT showed a larger than predicted final NeoLVOT surface: 215 mm2 [175-317]; p = 0.018. One patient died after ASA, and two others during the first year of follow-up. Survivors had significant symptom relief (p = 0.046) and a decreased PASP (38 mmHg [32-47] vs. 54 mmHg [46-62.5]; p = 0.028).\nCONCLUSIONS: Multistage CT analysis shows that ASA is effective in high LVOTO-risk patients undergoing TMVR.",Ayoub Belfekih,Alaa Masri,Aurélie Veugeois,Christelle Diakov,Khalil Mahmoudi,Sophie Ribeyrolles,Zoheir Mami,Clemence Roig,Nicolas Amabile,Christophe Caussin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,2025-04-30,10.1002/ccd.31446,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.31446,,Paid,105,5,1241-1250,Alcohol Septal Ablation for Left Ventricle Outflow Tract Obstruction Prevention Before TMVR Procedure CT Analysis Series BELFEKIH 2025,Not available,Left Ventricle Outflow,Tract Obstruction Prevention,Ventricle Outflow Tract,Outflow Tract Obstruction,Transcatheter Mitral Valve,Mitral Valve Replacement,Tomography Analysis Series,Left Ventricle,Alcohol Septal Ablation,Obstruction Prevention,2025-04-30,rejected,,LVOT obstruction,TMVR,alcohol septal ablation,,,,,,,,

This review aims at describing the different transcatheter strategies available and their results when managing residual MR after TEER.\nMETHODS: A literature search was undertaken across Pubmed, ScienceDirect, SciELO, DOAJ, and Cochrane library databases, to identify article reporting patients with post-TEER residual MR managed by a transcatheter approach that did not involve only the implantation of new clips.\nRESULTS: From 439 deduplicated studies, 24 articles ultimately met the inclusion criteria. Fifteen described an occluder device implantation, 12 with an Amplatzer and 3 with a Cardioform. The most feared complications were hemolysis and device embolization. Three cases of transcatheter annuloplasty were reported in patients with residual functional MR. An electrosurgical detachment of the TEER device from the anterior mitral leaflet (ELASTA-Clip) before mitral valve replacement was reported in 6 articles.\nCONCLUSIONS: Transcatheter procedures addressing residual MR after TEER in carefully selected patients are feasible in experienced centers.

6812ebff4ef6922f6d690760,40298961,Safety of Direct Oral Anticoagulants in Transcatheter Pulmonary Valves: A Pediatric Institution's Experience.,"Transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement (TPVR) is associated with an increased risk of valve leaflet thrombosis and leaflet dysfunction requiring thromboprophylaxis. The use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in pediatric patients with TPVRs is currently off-label without established data on safety and efficacy. The primary objective was a composite safety score consisting of clinically relevant non-major bleeding, major bleeding, bleeding-related re-admission, and medication discontinuation. The secondary objective consisted of the individual components of the composite score, in addition to valve thrombosis as represented by increasing transvalvular gradient by echocardiogram and valve complication requiring re-intervention. A single center, retrospective, descriptive study of pediatric patients who underwent TPVR placement. Patients were included in this study if they were less than 18 years old and received a DOAC in addition to low dose aspirin (standard of care) post procedure for thromboprophylaxis. Thirty-one patients were identified, of which 21 were males (68%) with a median age of 14 years (IQR: 13, 16) and median weight of 49 kg (IQR: 49, 60). Of the 31 patients, 4 (13%) met the composite outcome with all 4 patients having minor bleeding (13%), and one patient requiring hospital readmission for a minor bleed (3.2%). There were no major bleeds or bleeding-related deaths. No patients developed a valve thrombosis or valve complication requiring re-intervention. DOACs may be safe in pediatric patients after TPVR.

Many of these patients require ongoing interventions for residual defects, conduit or valve dysfunction, and arrhythmia management, often performed using transcatheter techniques. Imaging plays a critical role in ensuring procedural success and safety. Intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) has emerged as an essential imaging modality in ACHD interventions. With continuous technological advancements, ICE offers several advantages over transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), including superior visualization, real-time guidance, and the ability to avoid general anesthesia. These benefits have made ICE the preferred imaging tool for many transcatheter procedures. This review explores the expanding role of ICE in ACHD interventions, highlighting its applications in structural and electrophysiological procedures. By enhancing procedural precision and reducing complications, ICE is transforming the management of ACHD patients, optimizing outcomes, and improving long-term care for this complex and growing population.",Eihab Ghantous,Jamil A Aboulhosn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal of clinical medicine,2025-04-01,10.3390/jcm14072414,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm14072414,PMC11989321,Free,14,7,,The Growing Role of Intracardiac Echo in Congenital Heart Disease Interventions GHANTOUS 2025,pdfs\The Growing Role of Intracardiac Echo in Congenital Heart Disease Interventions GHANTOUS 2025.pdf,Congenital Heart Disease,Congenital Heart,Heart Disease,ICE,Adult Congenital Heart,Heart,Congenital,Disease,ACHD interventions,ICE catheters,2025-04-30,,,Adult Congenital Heart Disease,atrial septal defect,intracardiac echo,transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement,ventricular septal defect,,,,,,

Retrospective review of 42 consecutive cases from January 2017 to March 2024. The median age and weight of the cohort were 39.6 (27.3, 58.6) years and 69.8 (59.8, 85.3) kg and the Venus-P valve was successfully implanted in 98%. Severe adverse events included valve migration requiring surgical explant and PVR (n = 1), sustained ventricular arrhythmia (n = 1), and endocarditis (n = 1). At mean follow-up of 20.3 ± 19.6 months, there was no deterioration in valve performance and statistically significant improvement in NYHA class, right ventricular volumes, biventricular stroke volume, and LV ejection fraction. Cinefluoroscopic measurements of the deployed valves showed highest expansion and lowest eccentricity at valve coaptation level and greater frame deformation at the inflow compared to outflow flare. Supra-annular (n = 9) implant showed a higher expansion of the straight valve section compared to transannular (n = 32) deployment, related to lesser degree of valve oversizing and tissue characteristics at implant site. Transcatheter PVR with the Venus-P valve can be safely performed in a broad range of anatomies with clinical benefit at medium-term follow-up. Valve sizing focused on adequate deformation of inflow and outflow flares at implant location with minimal constrain at the valve portion and supra-annular positioning, may result in a higher degree of valve expansion and circularity. Ongoing follow-up of this cohort will provide important insights into valve longevity and long-term outcomes.",Sok-Leng Kang,J D R Thomson,Phuoc Duong,James R Bentham,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Pediatric cardiology,2025-04-02,10.1007/s00246-025-03841-5,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00246-025-03841-5,PMC7650030,Paid,,,,Single Center Experience with Venus P Self expanding Pulmonary Valve Insights on Valve Sizing and Procedural Techniques KANG 2025,Not downloaded,Venus-P Self-expanding Pulmonary,Self-expanding Pulmonary Valve,Procedural Techniques,Self-expanding Pulmonary,Venus-P Self-expanding,Valve,Single-Center Experience,discussing procedural insights,Valve Sizing,Pulmonary Valve,2025-04-30,,,Congenital heart disease,Pulmonary valve,Tetralogy of Fallot,Transcatheter,,,,,,,
6812ec094ef6922f6d690765,40012296,Mini-invasive surgical approach for hybrid pulmonary valve implantation: an option for very high-risk patients.,"Transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement is the first choice to treat residual or recurrent right ventricular outflow tract dysfunction. Surgery is an effective option when anatomy is not permissive for transcatheter procedures. When surgical risk is too high, hybrid procedures might be considered.In this paper, we describe the first use of Harmony valve in Europe in a 59 years old patient with a huge right ventricular outflow tract. The procedure was performed by a hybrid approach: before valve deployment, through an anterior mini-thoracotomy, the pulmonary artery was plicated to create a landing zone. The valve was deployed by trans-femoral venous approach. It was secured by putting a suture on the distal stent raw under fluoroscopic guidance. The procedure was uneventful and patient's New York Heart Association class rapidly improved from III-IV to II.In conclusion, hybrid strategies might represent an acceptable option for huge right ventricular outflow tract, to be less invasive and to minimise device embolisation risks. When a good match between patient's anatomy and device can be achieved, a mini-invasive or micro-invasive surgical approach might be considered to minimise bleeding risks and shorten the hospital's length of stay.",Biagio Castaldi,Vincenzo Tarzia,Giuseppe Tarantini,Domenico Sirico,Daniela Mancuso,Nicola Pradegan,Giovanni Di Salvo,Gino Gerosa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cardiology in the young,2025-04-30,10.1017/S1047951125000411,https://doi.org/10.1017/S1047951125000411,,Paid,35,4,845-849,Mini invasive surgical approach for hybrid pulmonary valve implantation an option for very high risk Pts CASTALDI 2025,Not available,ventricular outflow tract,pulmonary valve implantation,ventricular outflow,outflow tract,valve,valve implantation,pulmonary valve,outflow tract dysfunction,pulmonary,ventricular,2025-04-30,rejected,,CHDs,Harmony TPV valve,hybrid cardiac surgery,pulmonary valve replacement,transcatheter pulmonary valve,,,,,,
6812ec0b4ef6922f6d690766,39930947,Prevalence of Aspirin Resistance in Patients with Transcatheter Pulmonary Valve Replacement.,"BACKGROUND: Congenital heart disease (CHD) patients with pulmonary valve failure may undergo transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement (TPVR). Aspirin is often prescribed as long-term therapy after TPVR to prevent thromboembolic events (TE).\nAIMS: We aimed to examine the prevalence of aspirin resistance within the CHD TPVR population.\nMETHODS: The VerifyNow point-of-care test quantifies platelet aggregation as Aspirin Reactivity Units (ARU). ARU values greater than 550 suggest aspirin resistance (AR). A retrospective chart review analyzed ARU test results from May 2022 through December 2023 in CHD patients following successful TPVR (n = 48). Lifelong TE history was collected. Association between AR and sex, race, and ethnicity was examined with Fisher's Exact test, and the Wilcoxon rank sum exact test analyzed associations between AR and age.\nRESULTS: Three of 45 (6.67%) CHD TPVR aspirin-compliant patients (average age 33.14 years; range 0.74-77.86 years, 47% females) were AR. Interestingly, all AR patients were females, suggesting higher AR prevalence in females (p = 0.094). No significant associations were found between AR and age (p = 0.8), race (p = 0.077), or ethnicity (p = 0.2). No AR patients had a documented history of TE. Five of 42 (11.9%) aspirin sensitive patients had TE while taking aspirin, including two females (not on birth control at time of event) and three males.\nCONCLUSIONS: AR is prevalent in CHD TPVR patients, but TE occurrence did not correlate with AR. However, AR exclusively in females and TE in aspirin sensitive patients, suggests need for further investigations on the most effective TE prophylaxis in this population.",Alex Sigman,Emily Riley,Trudy Pierick,Osamah Aldoss,Prashob Porayette,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,2025-04-30,10.1002/ccd.31440,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.31440,PMC11962822,Free,105,5,1230-1235,Prevalence of Aspirin Resistance in Pts with Transcatheter Pulmonary Valve Replacement SIGMAN 2025,pdfs\Prevalence of Aspirin Resistance in Pts with Transcatheter Pulmonary Valve Replacement SIGMAN 2025.pdf,Aspirin,CHD TPVR,Patients,CHD TPVR patients,Aspirin Resistance,TPVR,ARU,CHD,CHD TPVR aspirin,CHD TPVR population,2025-04-30,rejected,,aspirin resistance,congenital heart disease,thromboembolic events,transcatheter pulmonary heart valve,,,,,,,

Methods: This prospective study enrolled 81 patients with severe ricuspid regurgitation (≥3+) who underwent TTVR with the LuX-Valve Plus system at the Department of Cardiology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University between May 2022 and March 2024. Among them, 44 patients were from a compassionate-use study, and 37 were from two premarket clinical trials. Baseline clinical data, preprocedural imaging, procedural outcomes, and postprocedural follow-up data were collected. The primary endpoint events included device success, procedural success, and 30 d composite adverse events. Results: The age of the cohort was (74.5±7.8) years, with 54 females (67%). Device success and procedural success rates were both 90% (73/81). Post-procedural tricuspid regurgitation improved, with a 6% (5/81) incidence of moderate-to-severe paravalvular leakage. The rate of permanent pacemaker implantation was 12% (10/81), of which 5% (4/81) had pre-existing indications for pacemaker implantation. Major bleeding events occurred in 10% (8/81) of patients, and the 30 d composite endpoint rate was 25% (20/81). Conclusion: TTVR using the LuX-Valve Plus system demonstrates promising feasibility for high-risk surgical patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation, effectively reducing or eliminating regurgitation with acceptable safety. However, challenges remain in reducing risks of major adverse events, including permanent pacemaker implantation and severe bleeding.\n目的： 评估应用LuX-Valve Plus 系统（宁波健世科技股份有限公司，中国）行经颈静脉经导管三尖瓣置换（TTVR）治疗严重三尖瓣反流在真实世界中的可行性。 方法： 本研究为前瞻性研究。纳入2022年5月—2024年3月于四川大学华西医院心脏内科使用LuX-Valve Plus系统行TTVR的81例三尖瓣反流（≥3+）患者。其中，44例患者来自同情救治性研究，37例患者来自上市前临床试验。收集入选患者的基线临床资料、术前影像资料、手术相关数据及术后随访资料。终点事件主要包括器械成功、手术成功和术后30 d复合终点事件等。 结果： 本研究入选患者的年龄为（74.5±7.8）岁，女性54例（67%）。全组患者中，使用LuX-Valve Plus系统行TTVR的器械成功率与手术成功率均为90%（73/81），三尖瓣反流得到改善，术后中度以上瓣周漏发生率为6%（5/81），永久起搏器植入率为12%（10/81），其中5%（4/81）为术前已具有永久起搏器植入指征。此外，术后严重出血事件发生率为10%（8/81），术后30 d复合终点事件发生率为25%（20/81）。 结论： 对于外科手术高危风险的三尖瓣反流患者，使用LuX-Valve Plus系统行TTVR治疗的可行性良好，能有效地减轻甚至消除反流，安全性也可接受，但该策略在降低永久起搏器植入和严重出血等主要不良事件发生风险方面仍面临挑战。.",F Chen,Z G Zhao,X Wei,Y J Liang,Z K Zhu,Y J Yao,X Li,Q Li,J F Wei,W Meng,Y Peng,Y Feng,M Chen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Zhonghua xin xue guan bing za zhi,2025-04-24,10.3760/cma.j.cn112148-20250127-00072,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112148-20250127-00072,,Paid,53,4,363-372,[Feasibility study of transjugular tricuspid valve replacement for the treatment of TR] CHEN 2025,Not available,Ningbo Jenscare Scientific,tricuspid valve replacement,West China Hospital,transjugular tricuspid valve,tricuspid regurgitation,valve replacement,TTVR,Ningbo Jenscare,Jenscare Scientific,severe tricuspid regurgitation,2025-04-30,rejected,,,,,,,,,,,,

6812ec144ef6922f6d69076b,40216352,Tricuspid valve replacement across the eras: Practice patterns and outcomes.,"BACKGROUND: Patients undergoing tricuspid valve replacement (TVR) historically have high mortality and morbidity, though there are limited contemporary reports of perioperative outcomes. We hypothesized that outcomes of patients undergoing TVR have improved over time.\nMETHODS: A retrospective review of adult patients undergoing surgical TVR from 2000-2023 at a single center was performed. TVR were split into 3 eras by surgery year (1: 2000-2013, 2:2014-2019, 3:2020-2023). Both isolated and concomitant TVR were included. Transcatheter TVR was excluded. The primary outcome was a composite of major morbidity and operative mortality. A multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify predictors of the primary outcome, incorporating age, comorbidities, and surgery era. Kaplan Meier analysis characterized long-term survival.\nRESULTS: A total of 250 patients underwent TVR, and 55% (138) were female with a median age of 57 (IQR 42, 69) years. Patients in the later eras had lower New York Heart Association classification and were more likely to have an elective operation than in the earliest era. The composite outcome decreased throughout the surgery eras (1:48% (40), 2:38% (33), 3:21% (17), p=0.002), but this was driven largely by decreased prolonged ventilation. This pattern persisted after risk adjustment (1:44% (95%CI 34%-54%), 2:41% (95%CI 31%-51%), 3:21% (95%CI 12%-30%), p=0.003). Mid-term (18-month) survival increased from 63% (95% CI 52%-73%) in Era 1 to 82% (95% CI 70%-89%) in Era 3 (p<0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: In the most recent years, major morbidity and mortality following surgical TVR has decreased, and mid-term survival increased significantly.

Nonetheless, the feasibility of more dedicated devices and the need for additional clinical evidence warrant further exploration.\nOBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to report the 1-year outcomes of the TRAVEL (Transcatheter Right Atrial-Ventricular Valve Replacement With LuX-Valve) study with the LuX-Valve system for patients with severe TR.\nMETHODS: A total of 126 patients with symptomatic severe TR were prospectively enrolled in the single-arm, multicenter TRAVEL study from June 2020 to August 2021. All patients underwent TTVR via the transatrial approach using the LuX-Valve system. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality and hospitalization for heart failure at 1-year follow-up. Clinical and echocardiographic outcomes were reported.\nRESULTS: At baseline, all enrolled patients (mean age 65.8 ± 7.5 years, 79.4% women) were at high surgical risk (mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons score 9.2% ± 4.4%), with severe or greater TR and NYHA functional class ≥ III. In 1-year follow-up, all-cause mortality was 10.3%, and 4.0% of patients were hospitalized for heart failure. TR was reduced to mild or less in 95.2% (P < 0.001), with decreases in right atrial systolic volume (-38.3 ± 21.7 mL; P < 0.001) and mid right ventricular end-systolic diameter (-6.4 ± 2.3 mm; P < 0.001). NYHA functional class I or II was achieved in 79.8% (P < 0.001), and 6-minute walking distance increased by 71.3 ± 42.8 m (P < 0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: The 1-year outcomes of the TRAVEL study showed a sustained reduction in TR among patients who underwent LuX-Valve TTVR, accompanied by significant right heart reverse remodeling and improved functional status.

Despite its prognostic impact, TR remains undertreated, with patients often referred at late stages when medical therapy is ineffective and surgical intervention high risk. Emerging transcatheter therapies offer a promising alternative for safer and effective management of this elderly patient population with numerous comorbidities.\nAREAS COVERED: This review highlights recent advances in treatment strategies and future directions for addressing significant TR. The literature search was conducted across the PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases. A structured search strategy was developed using 'tricuspid regurgitation' and 'management' or 'treatment' or 'therapy' and 'surgery' or 'tricuspid valve repair' or 'tricuspid valve replacement' or 'transcatheter tricuspid intervention' as MeSH terms and keywords.

6812ec174ef6922f6d69076e,40172796,Transcatheter Tricuspid Valve Replacement Versus Totally Thoracoscopic Beating-Heart Surgery for Tricuspid Regurgitation.,"PURPOSE: Totally thoracoscopic and beating-heart techniques used in tricuspid valve surgery (TTC-TVS) show favorable outcomes. Transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement (TTVR) is an increasingly utilized alternative for patients with tricuspid regurgitation (TR) at high surgical risk. The purpose of this study was to compare TTVR with TTC-TVS to examine the outcomes of these two different management protocols for patients with symptomatic severe TR.\nMETHODS: A total of 116 patients with symptomatic severe TR were retrospectively collected and divided into the TTVR (n = 38) and the TTC-TVS (n = 78) groups. The primary end points included 2-year all-cause mortality and the combined endpoint (all-cause mortality and hospitalizations for heart failure).\nRESULTS: At a median follow-up of 630 (IQR 450-720) days, the similar freedom from 2-year all-cause mortality (85.2% vs. 70.8%; log-rank P = 0.13) and different freedom from combined endpoint (75.3% vs. 49.8%; log-rank P = 0.0049) were followed in TTVR and TTC-TVS. After stratification by TRI-SCORE, TTVR subgroups showed significant difference in combined endpoint, and both also showed significant difference compared to the corresponding TTC-TVS subgroups (all log-rank P < 0.05). In multivariate Cox regression analysis, TRI-SCORE ≥ 6 was independently correlated with all-cause mortality (HR 3.913, 95% CI 1.481-10.337; P = 0.006) and combined endpoint (HR 4.070, 95% CI 1.924-8.608; P < 0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: TTVR may offer greater benefit compared to TTC-TVS for sicker patients with severe TR.

6812ec454ef6922f6d690777,40246047,MANAGEMENT OF ASYMPTOMATIC SEVERE AORTIC STENOSIS: A CRITICAL REVIEW OF GUIDELINES AND CLINICAL OUTCOMES.,"BACKGROUND: Asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis (AS) poses a clinical challenge with variations in recommendations for management.\nOBJECTIVES: We sought to compare contemporary guidelines focusing on asymptomatic AS management and present a summary of contemporary studies on early intervention in these patients.\nMETHODS: Systematic search of electronic databases was conducted with guidelines analyzed using a comparative matrix. A pooled random-effects meta-analysis of randomized controlled trial (RCT) data comparing intervention versus clinical surveillance in asymptomatic severe AS was also performed.\nRESULTS: Four guidelines from ACC/AHA, ESC/EACTS, JCS/JSCS/JATS/JSVS, and NICE were included encompassing 108 recommendations. Consensus was found for intervention thresholds including left ventricular dysfunction and very severe AS while discrepancies existed in the utility of biomarkers, myocardial fibrosis, exercise stress testing and choice of intervention. Despite variation in study inclusion criteria, current RCTs on the management of asymptomatic AS indicated a significant reduction in rates of major adverse cardiovascular events when comparing early intervention to clinical surveillance (hazard ratio [HR] 0.52 [0.42, 0.63]), driven primarily by reductions in unplanned hospitalizations (HR 0.41 [0.32, 0.52]).\nCONCLUSION: While there is broad consensus on classic indicators of severity such as left ventricular dysfunction as indication for intervention, guidelines diverge on other high-risk features warranting intervention. Early studies indicate the overall safety of early intervention, although further work is needed to identify whether it can reduce the risk of hard clinical endpoints. This underscores the need for further research and updated guidelines to clarify the optimal thresholds for intervention and harmonize treatment pathways for the growing number of patients with asymptomatic AS.",Abbey J Grbac,Melissa G Y Lee,David Chye,Jennifer Y Zhou,Riley J,Maximilian L E Steinfort,Sinjini Biswas,Ronen Gurvitch,William M Wilson,Andrew J Taylor,Jeffrey Lefkovits,Patrick T O'Gara,Michael M Borger,Fabien Praz,Gilbert Hl Tang,Anoop N Koshy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,American heart journal,2025-04-15,10.1016/j.ahj.2025.04.012,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ahj.2025.04.012,,Paid,,,,MANAGEMENT OF ASYMPTOMATIC sAS A CRITICAL REVIEW OF GUIDELINES AND CLINICAL OUTCOMES GRBAC 2025,Not available,SEVERE AORTIC STENOSIS,CRITICAL REVIEW,ASYMPTOMATIC SEVERE AORTIC,AORTIC STENOSIS,SEVERE AORTIC,CLINICAL OUTCOMES,ASYMPTOMATIC SEVERE,ASYMPTOMATIC,intervention,OUTCOMES,2025-04-30,,,aortic stenosis,aortic valve replacement,asymptomatic,guidelines,severe,,,,,,

6812ec534ef6922f6d69077b,40174596,"Orbital atherectomy versus balloon angioplasty before drug-eluting stent implantation in severely calcified lesions eligible for both treatment strategies (ECLIPSE): a multicentre, open-label, randomised trial.","BACKGROUND: Coronary artery calcification is common among patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and severe coronary artery lesion calcification is associated with increased procedural complexity, stent under-expansion, and high rates of intraprocedural complications and out-of-hospital adverse events. Whether calcium ablation before stent implantation can mitigate these adverse events is not currently established. We aimed to prospectively compare orbital atherectomy with a balloon angioplasty-based strategy before stent implantation for the treatment of severely calcified coronary lesions.\nMETHODS: In this multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial conducted at 104 medical centres in the USA, patients (aged ≥18 years) with severely calcified coronary lesions were randomly assigned (1:1) to orbital atherectomy or balloon angioplasty before PCI with drug-eluting stents using a web-based system (block sizes of four and six) and stratified by intended treatment of single versus multiple lesions and enrolling site. Randomly assigned lesions were deemed by operators to be eligible for both treatment strategies. Operators and patients were not masked to treatment. The two powered coprimary study endpoints were target vessel failure at 1 year (a composite of cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction, or ischaemia-driven target vessel revascularisation) and post-procedural minimal stent area at the site of maximal calcification, as assessed by intravascular optical coherence tomography in an imaging patient cohort. Primary analyses were by intention-to-treat. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.govNCT03108456, and 2-year follow-up is ongoing.\nFINDINGS: From March 27, 2017, to April 13, 2023, 2005 patients with 2492 lesions were randomly assigned to lesion preparation with orbital atherectomy (1008 patients with 1250 lesions) or balloon angioplasty (997 with 1242 lesions) before stent implantation. Median patient age was 70·0 years (IQR 64·0-76·0). 541 (27·0%) of 2005 patients were female and 1464 (73·0%) were male. Angiographically severe calcium was confirmed by the core laboratory in 1088 (97·1%) of 1120 lesions assigned to orbital atherectomy and 1068 (97·0%) of 1101 lesions assigned to balloon angioplasty. PCI was guided by intravascular imaging in 627 (62·2%) of 1008 patients in the orbital atherectomy group and 619 (62·1%) of 997 in the balloon angioplasty group. Target vessel failure events within 1 year occurred in 113 of 1008 patients in the orbital atherectomy group (1-year target vessel failure 11·5% [95% CI 9·7 to 13·7]) and in 97 of 997 patients in the balloon angioplasty group (10·0% [8·3 to 12·1]; absolute difference 1·5% [96% CI -1·4 to 4·4]; hazard ratio 1·16 [96% CI 0·87 to 1·54], p=0·28). Among those in the optical coherence tomography substudy cohort (276 patients with 286 lesions in the orbital atherectomy group and 279 patients with 292 lesions in the balloon angioplasty group), the mean minimal stent area at the site of maximal calcification was 7·67 mm2 (SD 2·27) in the orbital atherectomy group and 7·42 mm2 (2·54) in the balloon angioplasty group (mean difference 0·26 [99% CI -0·31 to 0·82]; p=0·078). Cardiac death events within 1 year occurred in 39 of 1008 patients in the orbital atherectomy group and in 26 of 997 in the balloon angioplasty group.\nINTERPRETATION: Routine treatment with orbital atherectomy before drug-eluting stent implantation did not increase minimal stent area or reduce the rate of target vessel failure at 1 year compared with a balloon angioplasty-based approach in severely calcified lesions deemed eligible for both treatment strategies. These data support a balloon-first approach for most calcified coronary artery lesions that can be crossed and dilated before stent implantation, guided by intravascular imaging.\nFUNDING: Abbott Vascular (Abbott).",Ajay J Kirtane,Philippe Généreux,Bruce Lewis,Richard A Shlofmitz,Suhail Dohad,Jithendra Choudary,Thom Dahle,Andres M Pineda,Kendrick Shunk,Akiko Maehara,Alexandra Popma,Bjorn Redfors,Ziad A Ali,Mitchell Krucoff,Ehrin Armstrong,David E Kandzari,William O'Neill,Carlye Kraemer,Krista M Stiefel,Denise E Jones,Jeff Chambers,Gregg W Stone,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Lancet (London, England)",2025-04-12,10.1016/S0140-6736(25)00450-7,https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(25)00450-7,,Paid,405,10486,1240-1251,Orbital atherectomy versus balloon angioplasty before drug eluting stent implantation in severely calcified lesions eligible for both treatment strategies ECLIPSE a multicentre open label randomised trial KIRTANE 2025,Not available,Orbital atherectomy,orbital atherectomy group,balloon angioplasty group,balloon angioplasty,stent implantation,lesions,stent,Orbital,angioplasty group,atherectomy group,2025-04-30,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A 77-year-old woman with recent VRE prosthetic valve (TAVR) endocarditis being treated with ampicillin and daptomycin for two weeks presented with bradycardia and hypotension in the setting of marked hypokalemia. Her hospital course was complicated by acute kidney injury. On day two of her hospitalization, she developed expressive aphasia, and an MRI was performed, which showed a corona radiata stroke. A transesophageal echocardiogram was pursued to assess for an embolic cause of her stroke. The echocardiogram showed a ruptured root abscess with an aortopulmonary fistula. After a risk and benefits discussion, the patient elected to pursue medical management. She was considered a high-risk surgical candidate in light of her recent stroke and worsened renal function. Moreover, her quality-of-life goals did not align with a prolonged or aggressive treatment approach. Optimal management strategies for patients with prosthetic valve infective endocarditis complicated by multiple comorbidities have not been elucidated.

We also explored the relationship between FR and NYHA class, 6-min walk test, left ventricular function, and quality of life (SF-36).\nMETHODS: The DSE protocol (n = 72) was performed up to 20 μg/kg/min preoperatively, and FR was defined as ≥ 20% increase in stroke volume (SV). Echocardiography, walking test, and SF-36 were repeated at 12 months follow-up.\nRESULTS: Average age was 80 ± 5 years. Preoperative peak aortic valve velocity was 4.7 ± 0.6 m/s and LVEF was 65% ± 9%. SV increased from 81 ± 19 to 92 ± 20 mL during the DSE. Twenty-five patients (36%) had FR. The prevalence of MACE was 13% at follow-up.

Radiomics were extracted from LV myocardium. Arm 1 (n = 400) served for method optimisation and removal of redundant features. In Arm 2 (n = 30), we identified radiomics associated with extracellular volume by CT (ECVCT); in Arm 3 (n = 159), radiomics were compared in patients with/without positive bone scintigraphy scan (training cohort, n = 84; validation cohort, n = 75) to build a radiomic signature for ATTR-CM.\nRESULTS: In Arm 1, unsupervised clustering of patients based on radiomics was associated with significant differences in patients' clinical profile among clusters. In Arm 2, we constructed a radiomic-based ECV (correlation with ECVCT: rho = .78, p = 1.2 x 10-6) with excellent diagnostic accuracy for high ECVCT (AUC = .925, 95%CI: .825-1.000, p = .0002). In Arm 3, a radiomic score (AmyloidRS) had good performance for ATTR-CM detection in the training (c-index .88, 95%CI: .80-.95) and validation cohort (c-index .84, 95%CI: .69-.98).

6812eca84ef6922f6d690788,40208300,C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio is associated with mortality after transcatheter tricuspid valve repair.,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter tricuspid valve repair (TTVr) is a treatment option for tricuspid regurgitation (TR) in patients with high surgical risk. Given the heterogeneity in clinical benefit, there is a need for markers to assess mortality risk in patients undergoing TTVr. The C-reactive protein (CRP)/albumin ratio (CAR) is a marker of systemic inflammation and reduced nutritional status, which can both occur in TR.\nMETHODS: Consecutive patients undergoing TTVr at a tertiary care center were retrospectively analyzed. Serum CRP and albumin were collected at baseline. Intraprocedural success (IS) was defined according to TVARC criteria. The primary outcome of all-cause mortality was assessed up to 2 years after TTVr.\nRESULTS: A total of 215 patients (69% females, median age 80 years) were identified. IS was achieved in 61% of patients. AUC of CAR for 2-year mortality was 0.695, with an optimal threshold of 1.2945 (Youden index) dividing patients in high CAR (n = 93) and low CAR (n = 122) groups. In the high CAR group, the primary endpoint occurred more frequently (43% vs 15%, p < 0.001) and significantly higher right atrial pressure, worse renal function, and less IS during TTVr were observed. High CAR was independently associated with an increased mortality risk even when adjusted for renal and liver function, right-ventricular function, and procedural failure (HR 2.188; 95%CI 1.2-3.9; p = 0.011).\nCONCLUSION: Higher CAR reflects patients with advanced right-heart failure and extracardiac organ damage and is associated with mortality after TTVr. CAR is derived from readily available parameters and may be useful additive to established risk scores.",Karl Finke,Laura Marx,Jan Althoff,Thorsten Gietzen,Matthieu Schäfer,Jan Wrobel,Philipp von Stein,Jennifer von Stein,Maria Isabel Körber,Stephan Baldus,Roman Pfister,Christos Iliadis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Clinical research in cardiology : official journal of the German Cardiac Society,2025-04-10,10.1007/s00392-025-02641-4,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00392-025-02641-4,PMC10198234,Free,,,,C reactive protein to albumin ratio is associated with mortality after transcatheter tricuspid valve repair FINKE 2025,pdfs\C reactive protein to albumin ratio is associated with mortality after transcatheter tricuspid valve repair FINKE 2025.pdf,tricuspid valve,tricuspid,transcatheter tricuspid valve,valve,tricuspid valve repair,isolated tricuspid valve,transcatheter tricuspid,tricuspid regurgitation,Transcatheter Tricuspid Interventions,tricuspid valve surgery,2025-04-30,rejected,,Biomarker,Inflammation,Malnutrition,Right heart failure,Transcatheter tricuspid valve repair,Tricuspid regurgitation,,,,,

Patients were allocated to training (n=195) and independent validation (n=131) sets based on hospital affiliation. A dual-phase feature selection process, combining least absolute shrinkage and selection operator logistic regression and the Boruta algorithm, was used to identify relevant variables from the multimodal dataset. A total of 5 ML model-decision trees, K-nearest neighbors, random forest, support vector machine, and extreme gradient boosting were used to construct a visualization and explainable predictive framework to elucidate model decision-making processes.\nRESULTS: The primary features identified included age, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, fasting blood glucose, triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio, triglyceride glucose index, triglyceride glucose-BMI index, atherogenic index of plasma index, and Apolipoprotein B. Among the 5 models, the support vector machine demonstrated the best predictive performance for major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events in patients with severe AS and HFpEF following TAVR, achieving an area under the curve of 0.756 (95% CI 0.631-0.881) in the independent validation set. The model exhibited good calibration and robust predictive power in both training and validation sets and demonstrated the highest net benefit in decision curve analysis compared to other models. To extract significant variables influencing the algorithm and ensure model appropriateness, we interpreted cohort and personalized model predictions using Shapley Additive Explanations values.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our ML-based multimodal model, incorporating 8 readily accessible predictors, demonstrated robust predictive capability for 12 months of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events risk. This model can be used to identify high-risk individuals with AS and HFpEF following TAVR, potentially aiding in risk stratification and personalized treatment strategies.",Jun Wang,Jiajun Zhu,Hui Li,Shili Wu,Siyang Li,Zhuoya Yao,Tongjian Zhu,Bi Tang,Shengxing Tang,Jinjun Liu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal of medical Internet research,2025-05-01,10.2196/70587,https://doi.org/10.2196/70587,,Paid,27,,e70587,Multimodal Visualization and Explainable Machine Learning Driven Markers Enable Early Identification and Prognosis Prediction for Symptomatic AS and HF With Preserved EF After TAVR Multicenter Cohort Study WANG 2025,Not available,Markers Enable Early,Enable Early Identification,Learning-Driven Markers Enable,Aortic Valve Replacement,Symptomatic Aortic Stenosis,Transcatheter Aortic Valve,Preserved Ejection Fraction,Markers Enable,Enable Early,Early Identification,2025-05-02,,,heart failure with preserved ejection fraction,interpretable models,machine learning,major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events.,symptomatic aortic stenosis,transcatheter aortic valve replacement,,,,,

However, the optimal timing of VA-ECMO use in high-risk TAVR remains controversial. We aimed to report our experience using a novel standby ECMO strategy during high-risk TAVR.MethodsWe retrospectively evaluated consecutive patients who received high-risk TAVR with standby ECMO between March 1,2023 and March 1,2024 at the Beijing Anzhen Hospital. Small, 5F or 6F sheaths were placed in ipsilateral femoral vein and artery before TAVR procedures. The primary outcome of this study was survival to hospital discharge with good neurological recovery defined as cerebral performance category (CPC) 1-2.ResultsA total of 24 patients undergoing high-risk TAVR with standby ECMO were included. Six (25.0%) of the 24 patients with standby ECMO suffered from cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest and required emergency VA-ECMO institution. The median (IQR) cannulation time was 8 (6-11) minutes, and the median (IQR) ECMO duration was 35 (24-48) hours. All of the 24 patients underwent successful TAVR procedures and survival to hospital discharge with CPC1-2.ConclusionsStandby ECMO with preset femoral vascular sheaths was feasible and effective for refractory cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest during high-risk TAVR.",Liangshan Wang,Yan Wang,Hongfu Fu,Xin Meng,Chenglong Li,Chunjing Jiang,Dong Guo,Bo Xu,Pengcheng Wang,Yu Li,Ming Jia,Hong Wang,Zhongtao Du,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Perfusion,2025-05-02,10.1177/02676591241263285,https://doi.org/10.1177/02676591241263285,,Paid,40,4,893-897,Feasibility of standby ECMO with preset femoral vascular sheaths for high risk TAVR WANG 2025,Not available,aortic valve replacement,transcatheter aortic valve,high-risk transcatheter aortic,standby ECMO,high-risk TAVR,valve replacement,TAVR,ECMO,transcatheter aortic,aortic valve,2025-05-02,,,femoral vascular sheath,high-risk,standby extracorporeal membrane oxygenation,transcatheter aortic valve,veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation,,,,,,

Feature importance was assessed with SHAP-values via the XGBoost-algorithm.\nRESULTS: The ALBI score exhibited the strongest association with 30-day mortality after TAVI (AUC = 0.723, p < 0.001), outperforming other scores in this regard and consistently demonstrating predictive power across various subgroup populations. Higher 30-day mortality rates were observed in the higher tertiles of the ALBI score compared to the lower tertiles (log-rank p-value = 0.004). The ALBI-based nomogram (C-index = 0.81, 95% CI:0.73-0.86, p = 0 < 001) demonstrated superior predictive power for 30-day mortality post-TAVI compared to the STS (C-index = 0.71, 95% CI :0.64-0.77, p = 0 < 001).

6813f18e96591f29f7007524,39965432,Machine learning for predicting outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve implantation: A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) therapy has demonstrated its clear benefits such as low invasiveness, to treat aortic stenosis. Despite associated benefits, still post-procedural complications might occur. The severity of these complications depends on pre-existing clinical conditions and patient specific complex anatomical features. Accurate prediction of TAVI outcomes will assist in the precise risk assessment for patients undergoing TAVI. Throughout the past decade, different machine learning (ML) approaches have been utilized to predict outcomes of TAVI. This systematic review aims to assess the application of ML in TAVI for the purpose of outcome prediction.\nMETHODS: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline was adapted for searching the PubMed and Scopus databases on ML use in TAVI outcomes prediction. Once the studies that meet the inclusion criteria were identified, data from these studies were retrieved and were further examined. 17 parameters relevant to TAVI outcomes were carefully identified for assessing the quality of the included studies.\nRESULTS: Following the search of the mentioned databases, 78 studies were initially retrieved, and 17 of these studies were included for further assessment. Most of the included studies focused on mortality prediction, utilizing datasets of varying sizes and diverse ML algorithms. The most employed ML algorithms were random forest, logistics regression, and gradient boosting. Among the studied parameters, serum creatinine, age, BMI, hemoglobin, and aortic valve mean gradient were identified as key predictors for TAVI outcomes. These predictors were found to be well aligned with established associations in current literature.\nCONCLUSION: ML presents a promising opportunity for improving the success and safety of TAVI and enhancing patient-centered care. While currently retrospective studies with low generalizability and heterogeneity form the basis of ML TAVI research, future prospective investigations with highly heterogeneous patient TAVI cohorts will be critically important for firmly establishing the applicability of ML in predicting TAVI outcomes.",Ruba Sulaiman,Md Ahasan Atick Faisal,Maram Hasan,Muhammad E H Chowdhury,Faycal Bensaali,Abdulrahman Alnabti,Huseyin C Yalcin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,International journal of medical informatics,2025-05-02,10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2025.105840,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2025.105840,,Paid,197,,105840,Machine learning for predicting outcomes of TAVI A systematic review SULAIMAN 2025,Not available,transcatheter aortic valve,aortic valve implantation,TAVI outcomes,TAVI,transcatheter aortic,aortic valve,valve implantation,TAVI outcomes prediction,outcomes,aortic,2025-05-02,,,Aortic stenosis,Deep learning,Machine learning,Outcome prediction,TAVI,TAVR,Transcatheter aortic valve implantation,,,,

Mild PVL remains prevalent after TAVI, and its impact on long-term survival is unclear. This study aimed to examine the incidence, impact on survival, and progression of PVL.\nMETHODS: This was a retrospective, single-institution cohort study of TAVIs between November 2012 and January 2023. Patients were stratified by 30-day PVL severity: none to trace, mild, and moderate to severe. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify risk factors associated with increasing PVL severity. Kaplan-Meier survival estimation and Cox proportional hazards regression were performed.\nRESULTS: A total of 3600 patients underwent TAVI. Of these, 2719 (75.5%) had none to trace PVL, 808 (22.5%) had mild PVL, and 73 (2.0%) had moderate to severe PVL at 30 days. On multivariable logistic regression, later years of valve implantation (2017-2023) were protective against PVL progression. Kaplan-Meier estimates of the 3 groups were significantly different (P < .001) with the moderate to severe group having reduced survival. On Cox regression, moderate to severe PVL was associated with increased mortality (hazard ratio, 1.80; 95% Cl, 1.31-2.46; P < .001), whereas mild PVL was not (hazard ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.89-1.15; P = .88) compared with none to trace PVL. For Kaplan-Meier estimates comparing the none to trace and mild PVL groups alone, landmark analysis showed reduced survival in the mild PVL group after 2 years (P = .03); however, this late reduction in survival in the mild PVL group did not persist on multivariable analysis (P = .14).\nCONCLUSIONS: After TAVI, moderate to severe PVL is associated with reduced survival compared with none to trace PVL. Mild PVL may result in a delayed survival reduction.",Nav Warraich,James A Brown,Eishan Ashwat,Dustin Kliner,Derek Serna-Gallegos,Catalin Toma,David West,Amber Makani,Yisi Wang,Ibrahim Sultan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The Annals of thoracic surgery,2025-05-02,10.1016/j.athoracsur.2025.01.012,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.athoracsur.2025.01.012,,Paid,119,5,1037-1044,PVL After TAVI Results From 3600 Pts WARRAICH 2025,Not available,Transcatheter Aortic Valve,Aortic Valve Implantation,PVL,Mild PVL,Paravalvular Leak,Valve Implantation,Transcatheter Aortic,Aortic Valve,severe PVL,trace PVL,2025-05-02,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6813f19196591f29f7007526,39855450,Outcomes and Predictors of Different Flow-Gradient Patterns of Aortic Stenosis After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.,"This study sought to explore the clinical factors associated with classical low-flow low-gradient (C-LFLG) and normal-flow low-gradient (NFLG) aortic stenosis (AS) compared with high-gradient (HG) AS. We also compared clinical and echocardiographic outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) across flow-gradient patterns. Patients with C-LFLG AS have a higher mortality rate after TAVR than those with HG AS. However, what leads to C-LFLG AS and the predictors of mortality in this population remain unclear. In this retrospective, single-center study involving 1,415 patients with severe AS, patients were classified as having (1) HG AS (aortic valve mean gradient [MG] >40 mm Hg), (2) C-LFLG AS (MG <40 mm Hg, stroke volume index <35 ml/m2, left ventricular ejection fraction <50%), and (3) NFLG AS (MG <40 mm Hg, stroke volume index ≥35 ml/m2, left ventricular ejection fraction ≥50%). Logistic regression was used for predictors of C-LFLG AS. Cox regression was used for predictors of mortality in the C-LFLG AS population. Male gender, multiple co-morbidities, and moderate to severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation correlated with the C-LFLG AS group. Patients with C-LFLG AS had a higher mortality risk compared with patients with HG AS at 2 years after TAVR. Patients with NFLG AS had similar mortality at 1 year, but higher mortality at 2 years after TAVR compared with patients with HG AS. End-stage renal disease, atrial fibrillation, and other co-morbidities were predictors of 2-year mortality in patients with C-LFLG AS. In conclusion, the mortality rate after TAVR was higher among patients with C-LFLG AS than those with HG AS. Male gender and multiple co-morbidities were predictors of C-LFLG AS. Multiple co-morbidities were predictors of mortality among those patients.",Besir Besir,Shivabalan Kathavarayan Ramu,Maryam Muhammad Ali Majeed-Saidan,Judah Rajendran,Odette Iskandar,Grant Reed,Rishi Puri,James Yun,Serge Harb,Rhonda Miyasaka,Amar Krishnaswamy,Zoran Popovic,Samir R Kapadia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The American journal of cardiology,2025-05-01,10.1016/j.amjcard.2025.01.019,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjcard.2025.01.019,,Paid,242,,42-52,Outcomes and Predictors of Different Flow Gradient Patterns of AS After TAVR BESIR 2025,Not available,Aortic Valve Replacement,Transcatheter Aortic Valve,Aortic Stenosis,Aortic Valve,Transcatheter Aortic,C-LFLG,Valve Replacement,Aortic,Patients,mortality,2025-05-02,,,aortic stenosis,classical low-flow low-gradient (C-LFLG) AS,high-gradient (HG) AS,normal-flow low-gradient (NFLG) AS,transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR),,,,,,
6813f19296591f29f7007527,39442866,Durability of right ventricular conduits in the Ross procedure.,"BACKGROUND: Right ventricular (RV) conduit availability and degeneration are potential limitations of the Ross procedure. Pulmonary homografts are the gold standard, but their limited availability drives the need for alternatives. The aim of this study was to compare results of different RV conduits.\nMETHODS: Between 1995 and 2023, 315 consecutive patients (73% males; mean age, 37 ± 12 years) underwent a Ross procedure using a homograft (n = 211), bovine jugular vein (BJV) (n = 34), or xenograft (n = 70) as the RV conduit. The mean follow-up was 5.7 ± 6.7 years and was 96% complete (1631 patient-years).\nRESULTS: Twelve patients (homograft, n = 8; BJV. n = 3; xenograft, n = 1) required RV conduit reintervention, including 4 patients within 4 years (all with homografts). Indications for reintervention were degeneration in 8 patients and active endocarditis in 4 patients. Reinterventions included RV conduit replacement (homograft, n = 3; xenograft, n = 1; BJV, n = 2) and transcatheter valve implantation (homograft n = 5; BJV, n = 1). At 15 years, freedom from RV conduit reintervention was 88%, and freedom from reoperation was 93%. Freedom from reintervention at 15 years was similar in the homograft (89%), BJV (89%), and xenograft (100%) groups (P = .812). Progression of mean RV conduit gradient was lowest for the BJV group (1.45 mm Hg/year) and similar in the homograft (2.6 mm Hg/year) and xenograft (2.9 mm Hg/year) groups. Age at <18 years at surgery (hazard ratio [HR], 1.9; P < .001) was a predictive risk factor for reintervention. There was no difference among the RV conduit groups (HR, 1.198; P = .606).\nCONCLUSIONS: The incidence of reintervention after 15 years is similar in recipients of homografts, xenografts, and BJV grafts. Interestingly, homografts may fail in the first few years, possibly related to inflammatory phenomena. Thus, the use of xenografts may be an option if homografts are not available.",Karen B Abeln,Lennart Froede,Christian Giebels,Hans-Joachim Schäfers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,2025-05-02,10.1016/j.jtcvs.2024.10.023,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcvs.2024.10.023,,Paid,169,5,1306-1314,Durability of right ventricular conduits in the Ross procedure ABELN 2025,Not available,Ross procedure,Ross,BJV,conduit,years,reintervention,homograft,homografts,xenograft,procedure,2025-05-02,,,Ross procedure,homograft,right ventricular conduit,,,,,,,,
6813f19296591f29f7007528,38936601,Five-year outcomes of transcarotid transcatheter aortic valve replacement.,"BACKGROUND: Transcarotid transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TC-TAVR) has emerged as an alternative access route for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). However, scarce data exist on long-term outcomes following TC-TAVR. This study aimed to evaluate clinical outcomes at 5 years after TC-TAVR.\nMETHODS: A total of 110 consecutive patients who underwent TC-TAVR were included. Baseline, procedural, and follow-up data were collected prospectively in a dedicated database. The primary endpoint was the incidence of a composite outcome of all-cause mortality, stroke, and repeat hospitalization at 5-year follow-up. Echocardiography results, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, and quality of life (QoL) as assessed with the EuroQol visual analog scale (EQ-VAS) were examined over the 5-year follow-up.\nRESULTS: The median patient age was 77 years (interquartile range [IQR], 72-82.2 years), 42.3% were women, and the median Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) risk score was 5.02% (IQR, 3.4%-7.5%). The incidence of the composite primary endpoint was 54.5%. Death from any cause occurred in 45.6% of patients (11.9 per 100 patient-years); stroke in 8.2% (1.9 per 100 patient-years); disabling stroke in 2.7% (0.7 per 100 patient-years); and rehospitalization in 27.2%. The improvements in valve hemodynamics, NYHA class, and EQ-VAS following the procedure persisted at 5-year follow-up (P < .001). The incidence of bioprosthetic valve failure was 0.9%.\nCONCLUSIONS: About half of the moderate-to high-risk patients undergoing TC-TAVR survived with no major cardiovascular events at the 5-year follow-up. The yearly incidence of stroke events was low, and early improvements in valve hemodynamics, functional status, and QoL persisted at 5 years. These results suggest the long-term safety and efficacy of TC-TAVR and would support this approach as an alternative to surgery in non-transfemoral candidates.",Juan Hernando Del Portillo,Dimitri Kalavrouziotis,Eric Dumont,Jean-Michel Paradis,Anthony Poulin,Frederic Beaupré,Marisa Avvedimento,Silvia Mas-Peiro,Pedro Cepas-Guillén,Siddhartha Mengi,Siamak Mohammadi,Josep Rodés-Cabau,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,2025-05-02,10.1016/j.jtcvs.2024.06.017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcvs.2024.06.017,,Paid,169,5,1452-1459.e4,Five year outcomes of transcarotid TAVR PORTILLO 2025,Not available,transcarotid transcatheter aortic,aortic valve replacement,transcatheter aortic valve,transcatheter aortic,transcarotid transcatheter,valve replacement,aortic valve,replacement,aortic,transcatheter,2025-05-02,,,aortic valve,long-term,transcarotid,transcatheter valve replacement,,,,,,,
6813f19396591f29f7007529,38815806,Machine-learning approaches for risk prediction in transcatheter aortic valve implantation: Systematic review and meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVES: With the expanding integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) into the structural heart domain, numerous ML models have emerged for the prediction of adverse outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). We aim to identify, describe, and critically appraise ML prediction models for adverse outcomes after TAVI. Key objectives consisted in summarizing model performance, evaluating adherence to reporting guidelines, and transparency.\nMETHODS: We searched PubMed, SCOPUS, and Embase through August 2023. We selected published machine learning models predicting TAVI outcomes. Two reviewers independently screened articles, extracted data, and assessed the study quality according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Outcomes included summary C-statistics and model risk of bias assessed with the Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. C-statistics were pooled using a random-effects model.\nRESULTS: Twenty-one studies (118,153 patients) employing various ML algorithms (76 models) were included in the systematic review. Predictive ability of models varied: 11.8% inadequate (C-statistic <0.60), 26.3% adequate (C-statistic 0.60-0.70), 31.6% acceptable (C-statistic 0.70-0.80), and 30.3% demonstrated excellent (C-statistic >0.80) performance. Meta-analyses revealed excellent predictive performance for early mortality (C-statistic: 0.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65-0.91), acceptable performance for 1-year mortality (C-statistic: 0.76; 95% CI, 0.67-0.84), and acceptable performance for predicting permanent pacemaker implantation (C-statistic: 0.75; 95% CI, 0.51-0.90).\nCONCLUSIONS: ML models for TAVI outcomes exhibit adequate-to-excellent performance, suggesting potential clinical utility.

Despite certain controversies, its use has rapidly expanded. We aimed to gather all the available literature regarding its indications and outcomes.\nMETHODS: A comprehensive search of articles published between December 2016 and May 2024 was conducted using BioMedCentral, Google Scholar, and PubMed to evaluate the main outcomes of Myval for native aortic stenosis (AS) (meta-analysis) and off-label uses (systematic review).\nRESULTS: A total of 151 studies were identified, and 74 were included in the analysis, covering aortic (n=51), mitral (n=9), tricuspid (n=6), and pulmonary (n=8) valve positions. A meta-analysis of studies on native AS demonstrated that Myval is safe and effective, with a 30-day mortality rate of 1.3%, good hemodynamic performance, low rates of pacemaker implantation (8.8%), and ≥ moderate paravalvular regurgitation (1.3%). Compared with other contemporary devices, Myval was competitive and associated with lower rates of pacemaker implantation. In a systematic review of off-label indications, Myval was also found to be safe and effective. In bicuspid AS, pure regurgitation, and aortic valve-in-valve procedures, success rates were 100%, 92%, and 100%, respectively, with pacemaker rates of 9.9%, 22.2%, and 3%, respectively. For mitral valve-in-valve/in-ring procedures, the success rate was 96.9%, while in tricuspid and pulmonary positions, small case series reported 100% success rates for both, with minimal procedural complications.\nCONCLUSIONS: Myval technology is safe and effective for the treatment of native valvular disease and dysfunctional prostheses or rings in all heart valve positions, although larger scale studies are warranted.",Mario García-Gómez,Clara Fernández-Cordón,José Carlos González-Gutiérrez,Ana Serrador,Alberto Campo,Carlos Cortés Villar,Sara Blasco Turrión,Cristhian Aristizábal,Julio Peral Oliveira,Alexander Stepanenko,Mikel González Arribas,Luca Scorpiglione,Akash Jain,David Carnicero Martínez,J Alberto San Román,Ignacio J Amat-Santos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Revista espanola de cardiologia (English ed.),2025-05-02,10.1016/j.rec.2024.09.006,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rec.2024.09.006,,Paid,78,5,447-464,The novel balloon expandable Myval transcatheter heart valve systematic review of aortic mitral tricuspid and pulmonary indications GARCÍA-GÓMEZ 2025,Not available,balloon-expandable Myval transcatheter,Myval transcatheter heart,Myval,INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES,Myval transcatheter,systematic review,transcatheter heart valve,balloon-expandable Myval,Myval technology,rates,2025-05-02,,,Aortic Regurgitation,Aortic stenosis,Estenosis aórtica,Insuficiencia aórtica,Myval,Myval Octacor,Valve-in-ring,Valve-in-valve,Valvular heart disease,Valvulopatías,

This study presents 10-year clinical outcomes of Medicare beneficiaries who underwent SMVR with a contemporary low-profile mitral porcine valve.\nMETHODS: This was a single-arm observational study using Medicare fee-for-service claims data. Deidentified patients undergoing SMVR with the Epic mitral valve (Abbott) in the United States between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2019 were selected by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth Revision procedure codes and then linked to a manufacturer device tracking database. All-cause mortality, heart failure (HF) rehospitalization, and mitral valve reintervention (surgical or transcatheter valve-in-valve) were evaluated at 10 years by using the Kaplan-Meier method.\nRESULTS: Among 75,739 Medicare beneficiaries undergoing SMVR during the study period, 14,015 received the Epic mitral valve (Abbott), 76.5% (10,720) of whom had underlying HF. The mean age was 74 ± 8 years. Survival at 10 years in patients without preoperative HF was 40.4% (95% CI, 37.4%-43.4%) compared with 25.4% (95% CI ,23.8%-27.0%) for patients with HF (P < .001). The 10-year freedom from HF rehospitalization was 51.3% (95% CI, 49.4%-53.1%). Freedom from mitral valve reintervention was 91.4% (95% CI, 89.7%-92.7%) at 10 years.\nCONCLUSIONS: This real-world nationwide study of Medicare beneficiaries receiving the Epic mitral valve demonstrates >90% freedom from all-cause valve reintervention and >50% freedom from HF rehospitalization at 10 years after implantation.

6813f1b196591f29f700752d,39945978,Tricuspid regurgitation after heart transplantation: where innovation and intervention are in hibernation.,"Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is a common valvular dysfunction following heart transplantation (HT), with reported prevalence rates ranging from 19 to 84%, primarily depending on the duration of follow-up. Its etiology is multifactorial and includes surgical technique, ischemic time, primary graft dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, pacemaker leads, and endomyocardial biopsies. Severe TR can significantly impair graft function, exercise capacity, and patient survival. This mini-review explores current management strategies, including surgical techniques such as annuloplasty and tricuspid valve replacement. HT patients are often high-risk surgical candidates due to factors such as immunosuppressive therapy, prior surgeries, and various comorbidities. Therefore, we primarily focus on the evidence regarding emerging interventional methods, such as transcatheter edge-to-edge repair. Although these interventions show promising early results, they remain relatively novel in HT recipients, and the current evidence is based on case reports and small studies. Further research is essential to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of these management strategies to enhance outcomes for HT recipients with TR.",Emyal Alyaydin,Alexander Gotschy,Danaë Parianos,Matthias P Nägele,Igor Tudorache,Andreas J Flammer,Julia Stehli,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Heart failure reviews,2025-05-02,10.1007/s10741-025-10494-2,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10741-025-10494-2,PMC11991953,Free,30,3,619-625,TR after heart transplantation where innovation and intervention are in hibernation ALYAYDIN 2025,pdfs\TR after heart transplantation where innovation and intervention are in hibernation ALYAYDIN 2025.pdf,heart,heart transplantation,University Hospital Zurich,Tricuspid regurgitation,donor heart,Tricuspid,Zurich,Heart Failure Reviews,surgical technique,pulmonary,2025-05-02,approved,,Heart transplantation,Heart valve prosthesis implantation,Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair,Tricuspid regurgitation,,,,,,,
6813f1c296591f29f700752e,40224373,Incidence rate of infective endocarditis by socioeconomic position: a Danish nationwide cohort study (2000-2022).,"BACKGROUND: People with lower socioeconomic positions have a higher risk of cardiac and infectious diseases than those with higher socioeconomic positions. However, how the increasing incidence of infective endocarditis among different socioeconomic groups has played out remains unclear. We therefore aimed to investigate nationwide temporal trends in infective endocarditis incidence rate by socioeconomic position in Denmark.\nMETHODS: Using nationwide Danish registries, we investigated infective endocarditis incidence rate (2000-2022). As socioeconomic position indicator, we used affluence level (accounting for household-level income and wealth), dividing the population into low, medium, and high affluence. Average annual percentage changes were computed to evaluate temporal trends. Slope index and relative index of inequality were calculated to obtain inequality gradients.\nFINDINGS: Per 100,000 person-years, the incidence rate increased from 8.7 in 2000 to 21.2 in 2022 among low; from 7.4 to 14.3 among medium; and from 6.2 to 13.1 among high affluence people. The average annual percentage change was 4.3% among low, 3.5% among medium, and 3.7% among high affluence people. The slope index of inequality increased from 3.8 additional cases per 100,000 person years (95% CI: 0.4-7.3) in 2000 to 12.3 (95% CI: 7.4-17.1) in 2022. The relative index of inequality increased from 1.68 (95% CI: 0.90-2.44) to 2.13 (95% CI: 1.49-2.78).\nINTERPRETATION: The infective endocarditis incidence rates increased in all affluence levels, with highest rates consistently found in the lowest affluence group, indicating that people with lower socioeconomic positions faced a disproportionately higher risk of infective endocarditis. These findings highlight the need to consider socioeconomic factors when addressing modifiable determinants that may curb the rise in infective endocarditis incidence.\nFUNDING: Independent Research Fund Denmark (grant no. 3101-00102B) and Center for Population Medicine, Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Aarhus University.",Søren K Martiny,Morten Schmidt,Jonas A Povlsen,Kirstine K Søgaard,Hans E Bøtker,Henrik T Sørensen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The Lancet regional health.

681568af31d52bb9ef6a6ac4,39904549,Valve thrombosis and antithrombotic therapy after bioprosthetic mitral valve replacement: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"AIMS: Transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR) has become a feasible alternative to surgical mitral valve replacement (SMVR) in selected patients at high surgical risk. The risk of valve thrombosis following SMVR and TMVR, and the optimal antithrombotic therapy following these procedures, remains uncertain. We aimed to compare the incidence of bioprosthetic mitral valve thrombosis (bMVT) after SMVR and TMVR, and the incidence of bMVT between patients on different antithrombotic regimens.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: A literature search of Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library was performed between January 2000 and August 2024. Random-effects models were used to derive pooled estimates of the incidence of bMVT in the absence of prior or active endocarditis and valve thrombosis. A total of 47 studies (6170 patients, total follow-up 9541.8 patient-years) were eligible for inclusion. The overall incidence of bMVT was 5.05 [95% confidence interval (CI) 3.18-8.01, I2 = 82%] per 100-patient-years. Subclinical bMVT was more common than clinically significant bMVT: incidence 19.11 vs. 7.91 per 100-patient-years, adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) 4.62 (95% CI 1.39-15.36), P = 0.012. bMVT was numerically more common after TMVR than SMVR, but the comparison was not statistically significant: incidence 7.03 vs. 0.58 per 100-patient-years, aIRR 2.19 (95% CI 0.72-6.72), P = 0.170.

681568b131d52bb9ef6a6ac5,40314376,[Treatment options in carcinoid heart disease].,"Neuroendocrine tumours (NET) constitute a heterogenous population of malignancies most often originating from the gastrointestinal tract. NETs cause substantial morbidity, both from local growth and from their ability to produce hormones that affect systemic physiology. About 20% of patients with metastatic NET disease and carcinoid syndrome develop carcinoid heart disease, a condition dominated by primarily right-sided heart failure caused by structural deterioration of the tricuspid and pulmonary valves. Ultimately, valve replacement may be indicated and has been shown to reduce heart failure symptoms and increase long-term survival. Bioprostheses are the valves of choice but have been shown to degenerate early in some patients due to chronic tumour-associated hormonal activity. New transcatheter treatment options are emerging, both as valve-in-valve procedures but potentially also as primary interventions, both in the tricuspid and pulmonary valve position.",Rickard Lindblom,Staffan Welin,Johan Forsblad,Anders Holmström,Azad Amin,Johannes Bergsten,Anders Albåge,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Lakartidningen,2025-05-02,No DOI Found,No Full Text Link,,Paid,122,,,[Treatment options in carcinoid heart disease] LINDBLOM 2025,Not available,carcinoid heart disease,heart,Treatment options,carcinoid heart,heart disease,carcinoid,disease,heart failure,metastatic NET disease,tricuspid and pulmonary,2025-05-05,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This cohort study aimed to evaluate the mutational landscape of CHIP and its' influence on clinical outcomes.\nMETHODS: 194 patients with AVS undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) were sequenced using a capture panel for multiple CH driver mutations and follow up conducted for three years.\nRESULTS: We found high prevalences (77.8%) of a broad spectrum of CH-driver mutations across 38 genes, with 34% of patients fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for CHIP. Evaluating the impact of CHIP driver mutations on outcomes, the presence of CHIP was associated with mortality only when adjusting for confounding factors (HR: 2.143, 95% CI: 1.029-4.461, p = 0.042), while the presence of CH driver mutations at low VAF showed no association with mortality (p = 0.377). However, when excluding DNMT3A-CHIP, we found a significant association of CHIP with mortality in univariate (p = 0.022) and multivariable (HR: 2.976, 95% CI: 1.381-6.411, p = 0.005) analyses.\nCONCLUSIONS: As the first study to evaluate a broad spectrum of CH driver mutations at all variant allele frequencies in the context of aortic valve stenosis, we found CHIP to be a frequent phenomenon and CH-driver mutations to be highly prevalent in patients with severe AVS. CHIP, other than DNMT3A-CHIP, was associated with increased mortality even after successful TAVR. The presence of CH driver mutations at low allele frequencies was not associated with mortality.",Raúl Nicolas Jamin,Baravan Al-Kassou,Theresa Kleuker,Jasmin Shamekhi,Benedikt Bartsch,Ansgar Ackerschott,Muntadher Al Zaidi,Hannah Billig,Claus Moritz Graef,Malte Kelm,Stephan Baldus,Georg Nickenig,Eicke Latz,Sebastian Zimmer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Clinical research in cardiology : official journal of the German Cardiac Society,2025-05-05,10.1007/s00392-025-02658-9,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00392-025-02658-9,PMC8874362,Free,,,,Mutational landscape and impact of clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential in severe aortic valve stenosis JAMIN 2025,pdfs\Mutational landscape and impact of clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential in severe aortic valve stenosis JAMIN 2025.pdf,aortic valve stenosis,Medicare,CHIP,clonal hematopoiesis,aortic valve,driver mutations,CHIP driver mutations,patients,valve stenosis,MDS,2025-05-06,,,Aortic valve stenosis,Clonal hematopoiesis,Transcatheter aortic valve replacement,,,,,,,,

681944faa97bbad15f6ea180,40320003,Machine Learning Methods to Predicting Transvalvular Gradient Waveform Post-Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Using Pre-procedural Echocardiogram.,"OBJECTIVE: Time-varying transvalvular pressure gradient after transcatheter aortic valve replacement indicates the effectiveness of the therapy. The objective was to develop a novel machine learning method enhanced by generative artificial intelligence and smart data selection strategies to predict the post-transcatheter aortic valve replacement gradient waveform using pre-procedural Doppler echocardiogram.\nMETHODS: A total of 110 patients undergoing TAVR (mean age 78.2 ± 9.0 years, 52.5% female) were included for pressure gradient collection. A deep machine learning model was trained and tested to predict post-procedural pressure gradient waveform from pre-procedural pressure gradient waveform based on the proposed generative active learning framework.\nRESULTS: The trained model demonstrated an average prediction accuracy of 84.85% across the 10 test patients measured from the relative mean absolute error between the predicted gradient waveform and ground truth. The generative method improved prediction accuracy by 3.11%, while the data selection strategy increased it by 16.03% compared to the baseline experimental group using plain machine learning. Additionally, Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated a strong agreement between the proposed method and clinical measurements for both mean and peak pressure gradient predictions.\nCONCLUSIONS: A deep, generative, active machine learning model was developed to output the prediction of post-TAVR time-varying pressure gradient from the pre-procedural time-varying gradient obtained from Doppler echocardiogram. Such a predictive method may help guide decision-making for the prevention of various post-TAVR complications.

681944faa97bbad15f6ea181,40319622,Perioperative management and outcomes of surgical pulmonary valve replacement following tetralogy of fallot repair: A retrospective study.,"BACKGROUND: While the long-term prognosis of Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) repair is favourable, the frequency of interventions for pulmonary valve insufficiency during follow-up remains high, raising concerns regarding its invasiveness. This study aimed to evaluate the safety measures and strategies for the perioperative management of pulmonary valve interventions following TOF repair.\nMETHODS: From November 2022 to December 2023, interventions in the pulmonary artery for TOF were performed in 17 patients; a retrospective analysis was conducted on all patients. Preoperative haemodynamic evaluation was performed using 4D-flow magnetic resonance imaging in all cases.\nRESULTS: The 17 patients included in the study had a mean age of 24.1 ± 14 years. The mean duration from repair to re-intervention was 18.2 ± 12 years, with a preoperative right ventricular ejection fraction of 42.3 ± 12 %. The mean surgical time, cardiopulmonary bypass time, and aortic cross-clamp time were 389 ± 96, 210 ± 67, and 106 ± 48 min, respectively. Pulmonary valve replacement was performed in eight patients, with seven using porcine aortic valves and one using a bovine pericardial valve. The Rastelli-type procedure was performed in nine cases, with seven using expanded polytetrafluoroethylene valved conduits and two using composite grafts of a porcine bioprosthetic valve and Valsalva graft. Additional procedures included right ventricular outflow tract myectomy in nine patients, pulmonary artery reconstruction in five, cryoablation in four, coronary artery bypass grafting in three, tricuspid valve repair in three, and ventricular septal defect closure in one. There were no cases of early mortality, stroke, or re-operation within 30 days.\nCONCLUSION: Interventions on the pulmonary valves following TOF repair can be safely performed with appropriate perioperative management. The primary goal of surgical pulmonary valve replacement is to preserve the right ventricular function and reconstruct a smooth pathway from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery, considering future transcatheter interventions. Further long-term follow-up is necessary to assess outcomes, such as remote mortality, right ventricular function, and arrhythmia occurrence.",Chiaki Aichi,Keiichi Itatani,Yosuke Nakai,Takumi Kawase,Jiryo Haibara,Satoki Ozoe,Hisao Suda,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,International journal of surgery case reports,2025-05-03,10.1016/j.ijscr.2025.111406,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2025.111406,,Paid,131,,111406,Perioperative management and outcomes of surgical pulmonary valve replacement following tetralogy of fallot repair A retrospective study AICHI 2025,Not available,tetralogy of fallot,pulmonary valve,pulmonary,pulmonary valve replacement,TOF,TOF repair,valve,surgical pulmonary valve,Perioperative management,pulmonary artery,2025-05-05,,,4D-flow magnetic resonance imaging,Pulmonary valve replacement,Tetralogy of Fallot,,,,,,,,

A Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to assess the survival rates, and multivariable logistic regression was applied to identify the predictors of LVEF improvement.\nRESULTS: The mean patient age was 84.8 ± 4.8 years, and 40.9% were male. Post-TAVR, 56.8% of patients showed ≥ 10% LVEF improvement (mean increase: 16.7 ± 6.1%). The one-year mortality was similar between the groups (p = 0.383), whereas the composite endpoint tended to be higher in Group N (0.4% vs. 21.1%, p = 0.072). The peak aortic valve velocity was the only significant predictor (OR = 0.255, p = 0.048; cutoff: 4.45 m/s, sensitivity, 0.840; specificity, 0.684).\nCONCLUSION: In patients with severe AS and a preoperative LVEF of < 50%, 56.8% demonstrated a significant early LVEF improvement post-TAVR.

We compared their serial clinical, echo imaging as well as cardiopulmonary exercise test data among PS, PR and MIXED subgroups.\nRESULTS: In 63 patients (20.8 years of age) the median early follow-up (FU) after TPVR was 6.2 months, and mid-term - 2.8 years. At baseline, the PR (n = 23) had lower LV EF, mass z-scores and global longitudinal strain (GLS) and the percent predicted peak O2 pulse than PS (n = 16) and those in the MIXED (n = 24) subgroups. BiV GLS improvement from baseline to early and to midterm FU occurred for all subgroups except for the LV GLS in the MIXED, which showed improvement from baseline to early follow-up. PR subgroup's LV GLS had gradual improvement, it remained lower than in PS and MIXED. No significant difference in exercise parameters were seen following TPVR. Freedom from reintervention at 10 years of FU was only 13.4 %.\nCONCLUSIONS: Patients with PR had lower LV systolic function and exercise capacity than those with PS or MIXED prior TPVR with normalization of systolic function midterm in all thereafter.

We analysed both pre- and postprocedural CT scans to identify predictors of HALT at 1 month after ViV TAVI and the association of HALT with clinical outcomes. The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause mortality, hospitalisation for heart failure (HF), or stroke at 3 years.\nRESULTS: Among the 117 patients analysed, HALT was detected in 37 (31.6%). In the multivariable analysis, anticoagulation therapy (odds ratio [OR] 0.28, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.08-0.92; p=0.037) and greater transcatheter heart valve (THV) expansion at the minimum area level (OR 0.95, 95% CI: 0.91-0.99; p=0.026) were significant predictors of reduced HALT following ViV TAVI. While there was no significant difference in all-cause mortality between patients with and without HALT (OR 1.13, 95% CI: 0.42-3.02; p=0.8), those with HALT had a significantly higher incidence of the composite primary outcome (OR 2.31, 95% CI: 1.04-5.15; p=0.04).\nCONCLUSIONS: HALT was frequently observed in patients who underwent ViV TAVI. Additionally, the presence of HALT correlated with a higher incidence of composite outcomes, including all-cause mortality, hospitalisation for HF, and stroke.

We prospectively followed 99 patients who had undergone a second CTA at 1 year to assess HALT progression. Thrombus volume and mean attenuation were quantified using semiautomated software, and various parameters of bioprosthetic deformation were analysed.\nRESULTS: Complete resolution of HALT was observed in 43 patients. Multivariate logistic regression showed that lower thrombus attenuation was an independent predictor of HALT resolution (odds ratio [OR] 0.45; p=0.030), along with the eccentricity index (OR 0.42; p=0.003), deformation index (OR 0.53; p=0.005), and implant canting (OR 1.88; p=0.026). In the 56 patients without complete HALT resolution, thrombus evolution was visually categorised as regression (48%), stability (29%), or progression (23%). In a quantitative assessment, regression was associated with a significant decrease in thrombus volume (291 mmÂ³ to 130 mmÂ³; p=0.007), while progression showed an increase (187 mmÂ³ to 667 mmÂ³; p=0.005). The change in thrombus volume between 30 days and 1 year correlated with the magnitude of changes in mean transvalvular gradients over the same period (r=0.462; p<0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: Quantitative thrombus characterisation on CTA is predictive of HALT resolution and correlates with the haemodynamic performance of transcatheter aortic valves.",Kajetan Grodecki,Damini Dey,Jolien Geers,Jacek Kwiecinski,Guadalupe Flores Tomasino,Vivek Patel,Caroline Park,Emily Xing,Dhairya Patel,Kazuki Suruga,Aakriti Gupta,Mamoo Nakamura,Mitch Gheorghiu,Tarun Chakravarty,Daniel Berman,Piotr Slomka,Hasan Jilaihawi,Raj R Makkar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,EuroIntervention : journal of EuroPCR in collaboration with the Working Group on Interventional Cardiology of the European Society of Cardiology,2025-05-05,10.4244/EIJ-D-24-01043,https://doi.org/10.4244/EIJ-D-24-01043,PMC12038363,Paid,21,9,e471-e481,Thrombus characterisation and evolution of hypoattenuating leaflet thickening after TAVI GRODECKI 2025,Not downloaded,aortic valve implantation,transcatheter aortic valve,hypoattenuating leaflet thickening,Quantifying hypoattenuating leaflet,HALT,transcatheter aortic,valve implantation,aortic valve,hypoattenuating leaflet,leaflet thickening,2025-05-06,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the introduction of transcatheter aortic valve replacement and extending indications to younger patients, the use of bioprosthetic valves (BPVs) has considerably increased. The main inconvenience of BPVs is their limited durability because of mechanisms similar as the fibro-calcifying processes observed in native aortic stenosis. One of the major gaps of the field is to identify therapeutic targets to prevent or slow the fibro-calcifying process leading to severe and symptomatic aortic stenosis.\nMETHODS: Explanted valves were collected from patients and organ donor hearts. A comparative transcriptomic analysis was performed on valvular interstitial cells (VIC) obtained from calcified (bicuspid and tricuspid) versus control valves. The mechanisms and consequences of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member A1 (ALDH1A1) downregulation were analyzed in VIC cultures from control human aortic valves. ALDH1A1 was inhibited or silenced and its impact on osteogenic marker expression and calcification processes assessed in VIC. The effect of all-trans retinoic acid on calcification was tested on human VIC cultures and on 2 animal models: the model of subcutaneous implantation of bovine pericardium in rats and the model of xenograft aortic valve replacement in juvenile sheep.\nRESULTS: Transcriptome analysis of human VIC identified ALDH1A1 as the most downregulated gene in VIC from calcified versus control valves. In human VIC, ALDH1A1 expression is downregulated by TGF-β in a SMAD2/3-dependent manner. ALDH1A1 inhibition promotes an osteoblast-like VIC phenotype and increases calcium deposition through inhibition of retinoic acid receptor alpha signaling. Conversely, VIC treatment with retinoids decreases calcium deposition and attenuates VIC osteoblast activity. Last, all-trans retinoic acid inhibits calcification development of aortic BPV in both in vivo models and improves aortic valve echocardiographic parameters in the xenograft sheep model.\nCONCLUSIONS: These results show that ALDH1A1 is downregulated in calcified valves, hence promoting VIC transition into an osteoblastic phenotype.

681aaa2eaeb52c213a4fadf3,40325824,Immediate and Early Outcomes Following Myval Octacor Transcatheter Heart Valve Implantation for the Treatment of Patients With Severe Aortic Valve Stenosis: The OCTACOR-EU Study.,"BACKGROUND: THV is a standard treatment for elderly patients with severe AS, using either BE or self-expanding (SE) THVs. While the Myval BE THV has demonstrated safety and efficacy, data on its latest iteration, the Octacor, are limited.\nAIMS: To evaluate the clinical performance of the next-generation Myval Octacor balloon-expandable (BE) transcatheter heart valve (THV) in patients with severe, symptomatic native aortic valve stenosis (AS).\nMETHODS: This observational, real-world, multicenter study involved patients deemed suitable for TAVR and treated with Octacor BE THV at 15 European centers. The primary endpoint was the rate of technical success (exit from procedure room) per VARC-3 criteria. Secondary endpoints included overall mortality, stroke, moderate-to-severe paravalvular leak (PVL), and need for permanent pacemaker (pPM) at 30-day and the longest available follow-up. An analysis by THV sizes (standard -20 to 29 mm vs. XL sizes -30.5 and 32 mm) was performed.\nRESULTS: From January to December 2023, 252 patients with severe AS underwent TAVR with the Octacor THV. The average age was 80.6 ± 6.7 years, and the mean STS score was 3.45%. Bicuspid anatomy was reported in 7.1% of cases (standard group 5.4% vs. XL group 20%, p = 0.004). Technical success was achieved in 98.8% of procedures (standard group 99.1% vs. XL group 96.7%, p = 0.2). At 30 days, overall mortality was 1.2%, stroke 3.2%, moderate-to-severe PVL 0.8%, and pPM 16.3%.\nCONCLUSIONS: The novel BE Myval Octacor THV showed high technical success and favorable early clinical outcomes. Longer follow-up and a head-to-head comparison versus other commercially available THVs are awaited.",Alfonso Ielasi,Rodolfo Caminiti,Arturo Giordano,Andreas Holzamer,Giampaolo Vetta,Luca Testa,Mihajlo Farkic,Nikolay Stoyanov,Francesco Gallo,Alessia Azzano,Juergen Leick,Federico De Marco,Mila Kovacevic,Eike Tigges,Marcin Protasiewicz,Sebastiano Immè,Antonio Mangieri,Maurizio Tespili,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,2025-05-05,10.1002/ccd.31563,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.31563,,Paid,,,,Immediate and Early Outcomes Following Myval Octacor Transcatheter Heart Valve Implantation for the Treatment of Pts With Severe Aortic Valve Stenosis The OCTACOR EU Study IELASI 2025,Not available,Heart Valve Implantation,Aortic Valve Stenosis,Transcatheter Heart Valve,Myval Octacor Transcatheter,Myval Octacor THV,Myval Octacor,Valve Implantation,Octacor Transcatheter Heart,Severe Aortic Valve,Valve Stenosis,2025-05-06,,,THV,aortic stenosis,bioprosthesis,,,,,,,,
