40358404,"Navigating Bleeding, Thrombosis, and Antithrombotic Management in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.","Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has revolutionized the treatment of aortic stenosis, providing a less invasive alternative to surgical valve replacement. However, post-TAVR management remains complex, particularly concerning antithrombotic strategies, as patients face competing risks of bleeding and thrombosis. This review explores the evolving landscape of anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy in TAVR patients, examining current American and European guidelines, clinical trial data, and the role of direct oral anticoagulants. We also highlight the interplay between atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and antithrombotic therapy, emphasizing personalized approaches to patient management. Finally, we discuss complications such as stroke, subclinical leaflet thrombosis, and major bleeding, offering insights into mitigation strategies.

40357687,Self-Expanding Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation in Patients with Severe Aortic Stenosis Undergoing Prosthetic Mitral Valve Replacement: A Single-Center Experience.,"BACKGROUND: Following the encouraging results of several registries and trials, transcatheter aortic valve implantation has become standard therapy for aortic stenosis patients with intermediate or high operative risk for surgical treatment. Good procedural success and good clinical outcomes have been shown, but very limited data exist on transcatheter aortic valve implantation in the setting of a preexisting mitral valve (MV) prosthesis regarding the technique, potential complications, and outcomes. Single-center experience is presented with this special patient cohort.
METHODS: Here, 31 cases of transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation with a self-expanding bioprosthesis (CoreValve and Evolut R; Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) in patients who had previously undergone MV surgery have been reported. Preprocedural, intraprocedural, and post-procedural outcomes and data were analyzed.
RESULTS: Between February 2013 and December 2023, 31 patients with prior MV prostheses were included. The average age was 68.7 years, and 77.4% were female. Mechanical MV prostheses were present in 90.3% of patients. The mean Society of Thoracic Surgeon score was 9.03. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation was performed 14.75 years after MV replacement. Post-procedural complications included access site issues in 25.8% of patients, with 22.5% requiring pacemaker implantation. No procedural mortality occurred. Six out of 31 patients (n = 6/31 patients) died during follow-up, primarily due to respiratory complications, and the mean survival time was 74.9 ± 8.4 months (95% CI: 58.4-91.4).
CONCLUSION: The experiences showed that transfemoral implantation of a self-expanding aortic valve with MV prostheses patients, via the transfemoral route, is safe and feasible, with maintained long-term results.","['Ahmet Kıvrak', 'Ahmet Hakan Ateş', 'Can Menemencioğlu', 'Mert Doğan', 'Mehmet Levent Şahiner', 'Ergün Barış Kaya', 'Kudret Aytemir']",Anatolian journal of cardiology,2025-05-13,10.14744/AnatolJCardiol.2025.5124,https://doi.org/10.14744/AnatolJCardiol.2025.5124,,Paid,Self Expanding Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation in Patients with Severe Aortic Stenosis Undergoing Prosthetic Mitral Valve Replacement A Single Center Experience KIVRAK 2025,Not available,"['Stenosis Undergoing Prosthetic', 'Undergoing Prosthetic Mitral', 'Aortic Stenosis Undergoing', 'Severe Aortic Stenosis', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Prosthetic Mitral Valve', 'Undergoing Prosthetic', 'Aortic Valve Implantation', 'Aortic Valve', 'Stenosis Undergoing']",2025-05-14,Pending,[]
40353875,Evidence of bioprosthetic valve dysfunction during three-year follow-up following TAVR.,"OBJECTIVE: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has increased significantly in younger patients and patients at lower surgical risk. In this retrospective multicenter study, we aimed to assess for bioprosthetic valve dysfunction (BVD) during three-year follow-up (FU) and potential differences between self-expandable (SEV) and balloon-expandable valves (BEV) under real-world conditions.
METHODS: Endpoints were defined according to VARC-3 criteria, including VARC composite endpoints during three-year FU.
RESULTS: A total of 1233 patients with tricuspid aortic valve stenosis, who underwent TAVR with contemporary transcatheter heart valve (THV) devices from three different tertiary care centers were included. One-fifth of the study population showed BVD at three-year FU (BVD[-]: n = 957;77.6%; BVD[+]: n = 276;22.4%). Non-structural valve deterioration (NSVD) was the most represented category (8.5%) followed by structural valve deterioration (SVD, 5.3%). BVD was more common in association with BEV as compared with SEV (60.9% vs 39.1%; p < 0.001) owing to higher rates of SVD (13.5% vs 9.5%; p = 0.028) and NSVD (17.9% vs. 13.8%; p = 0.048). Subclinical leaflet thrombosis was only documented in BEV (1.7%, p < 0.001). At three years, all-cause mortality was higher in BVD+ patients (BVD[-] vs. BVD[+]: 13.2% vs. 22.5%; HR: 1.99; 95%-CI: 1.39-2.85; p < 0.001*) but did not differ between THV platform.
CONCLUSION: BVD after TAVR is common and associated with higher all-cause mortality. Despite a preponderance of BVD in association with balloon-expandable valves, mortality rates remain similar between THV platforms.

40353871,Predictive performance of the TRI-SCORE in patients with severe aortic stenosis and concomitant tricuspid regurgitation undergoing TAVR.,"BACKGROUND: Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is a common comorbidity in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and represents a significant predictor of adverse outcomes. Precise risk stratification through clinical scoring systems is vital for tailoring treatment decisions in this patient population.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the applicability of the TRI-SCORE for predicting adverse outcomes in patients with AS and concomitant moderate-to-severe TR undergoing TAVR and to compare its performance with established surgical risk scores like the EuroSCORE II and Society of Thoracic Surgeons score (STS-Score).
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 301 patients with severe AS and concomitant TR who underwent TAVR between 2013 and 2022 at the Heart Center Bonn. According to the TRI-SCORE, patients were stratified into a low or intermediate-risk group (TRI-SCORE 0-5) and a high-risk group (TRI-SCORE 6-12). The primary endpoint was 2-year all-cause mortality. Predictive values of the TRI-SCORE were compared to the EuroSCORE II and the STS-Score for both 30-day and 2-year mortality outcomes.
RESULTS: The 2-year mortality rate was significantly higher in the high-risk group compared to the low or intermediate-risk group (TRI-SCORE 6-12: 40.0% vs. TRI-SCORE 0-5: 17.9%; p < 0.001). For predicting 30-day mortality, the EuroSCORE II and the STS-Score demonstrated superior predictive values, with AUCs of 78.4% and 83.0%, respectively, in comparison to the TRI-SCORE, which showed an AUC of 70.0%. Conversely, the TRI-SCORE allowed a better risk prediction with regard to 2-year all-cause mortality, achieving an AUC of 69.7%, superior to the EuroSCORE II (60.6%) and the STS-Score (62.1%).
CONCLUSION: The TRI-SCORE is effective in predicting mid-term mortality in patients with AS and moderate-to-severe TR undergoing TAVR, demonstrating greater robustness than the EuroSCORE II and the STS-Score for this timeframe.","['Mustafa Mousa Basha', 'Baravan Al-Kassou', 'Christopher Gestrich', 'Marcel Weber', 'Thomas Beiert', 'Sebastian Zimmer', 'Farhad Bakhtiary', 'Georg Nickenig', 'Jasmin Shamekhi']",Clinical research in cardiology : official journal of the German Cardiac Society,2025-05-12,10.1007/s00392-025-02671-y,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00392-025-02671-y,PMC5698373,Free,Predictive performance of the TRI SCORE in patients with severe aortic stenosis and concomitant tricuspid regurgitation undergoing TAVR BASHA 2025,pdfs\Predictive performance of the TRI SCORE in patients with severe aortic stenosis and concomitant tricuspid regurgitation undergoing TAVR BASH.pdf,"['patients', 'patients undergoing TAVI', 'TAVI', 'TRV', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'aortic valve', 'mortality', 'aortic valve implantation', 'all-cause mortality', 'undergoing TAVR']",2025-05-14,Pending,"['Aortic valve stenosis', 'EuroSCORE II', 'STS-Score', 'TRI-SCORE', 'Transcatheter aortic valve replacement', 'Tricuspid regurgitation']"

40350498,Feasibility of Self-Expanding Transcatheter Pulmonary Valves in Patients with Pyramidal RVOT: Favorable Mid-term Outcomes.,"Transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement (TPVR) is effective for treating significant pulmonary regurgitation (PR), but mid-term data in patients with pyramidal right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) anatomy are limited. This multi-center retrospective study included patients who underwent TPVR between May 2014 and September 2023. Baseline and echocardiographic data were compared between patients with pyramidal and non-pyramidal RVOT. The primary endpoint was peri-procedural device success, defined as technical success, optimal valve function on discharge echocardiography (RVOT gradient < 30 mmHg, less than moderate PR, no significant paravalvular leak), and absence of in-hospital mortality or re-intervention. The secondary endpoint was 1-year freedom from all-cause mortality, cardiac hospitalization, endocarditis, significant stent fracture, valve dysfunction, and device-related re-intervention. Sixty-eight patients were enrolled. Device success was achieved in 86.7% of pyramidal RVOT patients and 100% of non-pyramidal patients (P = 0.067). At 1 year, no significant difference was observed in the composite secondary endpoint (91.7% vs. 86.0%, P = 0.605). Both groups showed similar improvements in echocardiographic and clinical outcomes. Additionally, no statistically significant differences were observed between the two groups regarding post-TPVR regurgitation and paravalvular leakage. TPVR using self-expanding valves in pyramidal RVOT showed acceptable device success rates and favorable mid-term outcomes in both clinical and hemodynamic parameters. Morphology-based pre-procedural planning is essential for optimizing results.","['Wenhao Zhu', 'Zhiyuan Xia', 'Jeffery Shi Kai Chan', 'Junyi Wan', 'Liang Xu', 'Yihang Li', 'Jingnan Zhang', 'Gary Tse', 'Fang Fang', 'Gejun Zhang']",Pediatric cardiology,2025-05-12,10.1007/s00246-025-03876-8,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00246-025-03876-8,PMC6398292,Free,Feasibility of Self Expanding Transcatheter Pulmonary Valves in Patients with Pyramidal RVOT Favorable Mid term Outcomes ZHU 2025,pdfs\Feasibility of Self Expanding Transcatheter Pulmonary Valves in Patients with Pyramidal RVOT Favorable Mid term Outcomes ZHU 2025.pdf,"['STROBE guidelines', 'study', 'observational study', 'STROBE', 'Transcatheter Pulmonary Valves', 'study design', 'observational', 'guidelines', 'pyramidal RVOT patients', 'Transcatheter Pulmonary']",2025-05-14,Pending,"['Computed tomography', 'Congenital heart disease', 'Transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement']"

Precise risk stratification through clinical scoring systems is vital for tailoring treatment decisions in this patient population.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the applicability of the TRI-SCORE for predicting adverse outcomes in patients with AS and concomitant moderate-to-severe TR undergoing TAVR and to compare its performance with established surgical risk scores like the EuroSCORE II and Society of Thoracic Surgeons score (STS-Score).
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 301 patients with severe AS and concomitant TR who underwent TAVR between 2013 and 2022 at the Heart Center Bonn. According to the TRI-SCORE, patients were stratified into a low or intermediate-risk group (TRI-SCORE 0-5) and a high-risk group (TRI-SCORE 6-12). The primary endpoint was 2-year all-cause mortality. Predictive values of the TRI-SCORE were compared to the EuroSCORE II and the STS-Score for both 30-day and 2-year mortality outcomes.
RESULTS: The 2-year mortality rate was significantly higher in the high-risk group compared to the low or intermediate-risk group (TRI-SCORE 6-12: 40.0% vs. TRI-SCORE 0-5: 17.9%; p < 0.001). For predicting 30-day mortality, the EuroSCORE II and the STS-Score demonstrated superior predictive values, with AUCs of 78.4% and 83.0%, respectively, in comparison to the TRI-SCORE, which showed an AUC of 70.0%. Conversely, the TRI-SCORE allowed a better risk prediction with regard to 2-year all-cause mortality, achieving an AUC of 69.7%, superior to the EuroSCORE II (60.6%) and the STS-Score (62.1%).
CONCLUSION: The TRI-SCORE is effective in predicting mid-term mortality in patients with AS and moderate-to-severe TR undergoing TAVR, demonstrating greater robustness than the EuroSCORE II and the STS-Score for this timeframe.","['Mustafa Mousa Basha', 'Baravan Al-Kassou', 'Christopher Gestrich', 'Marcel Weber', 'Thomas Beiert', 'Sebastian Zimmer', 'Farhad Bakhtiary', 'Georg Nickenig', 'Jasmin Shamekhi']",Clinical research in cardiology : official journal of the German Cardiac Society,2025-05-12,10.1007/s00392-025-02671-y,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00392-025-02671-y,PMC5698373,Free,Predictive performance of the TRI SCORE in patients with severe aortic stenosis and concomitant tricuspid regurgitation undergoing TAVR BASHA 2025,pdfs\Predictive performance of the TRI SCORE in patients with severe aortic stenosis and concomitant tricuspid regurgitation undergoing TAVR BASH.pdf,"['patients', 'patients undergoing TAVI', 'TAVI', 'TRV', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'aortic valve', 'mortality', 'aortic valve implantation', 'all-cause mortality', 'undergoing TAVR']",2025-05-14,Pending,"['Aortic valve stenosis', 'EuroSCORE II', 'STS-Score', 'TRI-SCORE', 'Transcatheter aortic valve replacement', 'Tricuspid regurgitation']"
40360941,Children are Less Likely Than Adults to Develop Complete Heart Block Following TAVR.,"TAVR is an alternative to surgical aortic valve [AoV] replacement. In adults, rates of atrioventricular block [AVB] requiring permanent pacemaker [PPM] placement in the modern era are 4-24%. Post-TAVR conduction abnormality incidence and risk factors are unknown in children and young adults. Describe post-TAVR conduction abnormalities in children and young adults. Retrospective single-center review of patients undergoing TAVR (9/2014 to 6/2021). Patients with pre-existing complete AVB or PPM were excluded (N = 1). The relationship between described adult risk factors for AVB and primary outcome of new conduction abnormality was assessed. Of 28 cases (Ages 3.5-22 y), 50% were male and 43% had isolated AoV disease, and the remainder with multilevel obstructive left-sided heart disease (29%) or complex congenital heart disease (29%). Baseline conduction abnormality was present in 57% (16/28), with right bundle branch block the most prevalent (9, 56%). Post-TAVR, acute- and late-onset conduction abnormalities occurred in 9 and 2 patients, respectively, and resolved in 8/11 patients during follow-up. One patient required PPM for complete heart block. There was no association between new conduction abnormality and previously reported adult risk factors-baseline RBBB, membranous septum length, valve implantation depth, or degree of valve oversizing. There was no relationship between outcome and baseline conduction abnormality nor history of multiple AoV interventions. In our pediatric series, AVB requiring PPM was rare following TAVR, with an incidence 3.6%-lower than average rates reported in adult literature. We identified no association of conduction abnormality with described adult risk factors.","['Claire A Newlon', 'Mary C Niu', 'Edem Binka', 'Dana M Boucek', 'Zhining Ou', 'Susan P Etheridge', 'Thomas A Pilcher', 'Mary Hunt Martin', 'Robert G Gray', 'S Yukiko Asaki']",Pediatric cardiology,2025-05-13,10.1007/s00246-025-03889-3,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00246-025-03889-3,PMC6519402,Free,Children are Less Likely Than Adults to Develop Complete Heart Block Following TAVR NEWLON 2025,pdfs\Children are Less Likely Than Adults to Develop Complete Heart Block Following TAVR NEWLON 2025.pdf,"['membranous septum', 'Develop Complete Heart', 'conduction damage', 'PPI', 'conduction', 'Cincinnati Children Hospital', 'septum', 'TAVI', 'aortic valve', 'aortic']",2025-05-14,Pending,"['Congenital heart disease', 'Pacemaker', 'Pediatrics', 'TAVR']"
40358404,"Navigating Bleeding, Thrombosis, and Antithrombotic Management in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.","Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has revolutionized the treatment of aortic stenosis, providing a less invasive alternative to surgical valve replacement. However, post-TAVR management remains complex, particularly concerning antithrombotic strategies, as patients face competing risks of bleeding and thrombosis. This review explores the evolving landscape of anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy in TAVR patients, examining current American and European guidelines, clinical trial data, and the role of direct oral anticoagulants. We also highlight the interplay between atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and antithrombotic therapy, emphasizing personalized approaches to patient management. Finally, we discuss complications such as stroke, subclinical leaflet thrombosis, and major bleeding, offering insights into mitigation strategies. As the field continues to evolve, ongoing research will shape future recommendations to optimize outcomes for patients undergoing TAVR.","['Jude Elsaygh', 'Manish A Parikh', 'William H Frishman', 'Stephen J Peterson']",Cardiology in review,2025-05-13,10.1097/CRD.0000000000000908,https://doi.org/10.1097/CRD.0000000000000908,,Paid,Navigating Bleeding Thrombosis and Antithrombotic Management in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement ELSAYGH 2025,Not available,"['Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Valve Replacement', 'surgical valve replacement', 'Aortic Valve', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'Replacement', 'Valve', 'Aortic', 'Navigating Bleeding']",2025-05-14,Pending,"['TAVR', 'anticoagulation', 'antiplatelet', 'aortic stenosis', 'aortic valve', 'aortic valve replacement', 'bleeding', 'thrombosis']"
40353875,Evidence of bioprosthetic valve dysfunction during three-year follow-up following TAVR.,"OBJECTIVE: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has increased significantly in younger patients and patients at lower surgical risk. In this retrospective multicenter study, we aimed to assess for bioprosthetic valve dysfunction (BVD) during three-year follow-up (FU) and potential differences between self-expandable (SEV) and balloon-expandable valves (BEV) under real-world conditions.
METHODS: Endpoints were defined according to VARC-3 criteria, including VARC composite endpoints during three-year FU.
RESULTS: A total of 1233 patients with tricuspid aortic valve stenosis, who underwent TAVR with contemporary transcatheter heart valve (THV) devices from three different tertiary care centers were included. One-fifth of the study population showed BVD at three-year FU (BVD[-]: n = 957;77.6%; BVD[+]: n = 276;22.4%). Non-structural valve deterioration (NSVD) was the most represented category (8.5%) followed by structural valve deterioration (SVD, 5.3%). BVD was more common in association with BEV as compared with SEV (60.9% vs 39.1%; p < 0.001) owing to higher rates of SVD (13.5% vs 9.5%; p = 0.028) and NSVD (17.9% vs. 13.8%; p = 0.048). Subclinical leaflet thrombosis was only documented in BEV (1.7%, p < 0.001). At three years, all-cause mortality was higher in BVD+ patients (BVD[-] vs. BVD[+]: 13.2% vs. 22.5%; HR: 1.99; 95%-CI: 1.39-2.85; p < 0.001*) but did not differ between THV platform.
CONCLUSION: BVD after TAVR is common and associated with higher all-cause mortality. Despite a preponderance of BVD in association with balloon-expandable valves, mortality rates remain similar between THV platforms.

40350498,Feasibility of Self-Expanding Transcatheter Pulmonary Valves in Patients with Pyramidal RVOT: Favorable Mid-term Outcomes.,"Transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement (TPVR) is effective for treating significant pulmonary regurgitation (PR), but mid-term data in patients with pyramidal right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) anatomy are limited. This multi-center retrospective study included patients who underwent TPVR between May 2014 and September 2023. Baseline and echocardiographic data were compared between patients with pyramidal and non-pyramidal RVOT. The primary endpoint was peri-procedural device success, defined as technical success, optimal valve function on discharge echocardiography (RVOT gradient < 30 mmHg, less than moderate PR, no significant paravalvular leak), and absence of in-hospital mortality or re-intervention. The secondary endpoint was 1-year freedom from all-cause mortality, cardiac hospitalization, endocarditis, significant stent fracture, valve dysfunction, and device-related re-intervention. Sixty-eight patients were enrolled. Device success was achieved in 86.7% of pyramidal RVOT patients and 100% of non-pyramidal patients (P = 0.067). At 1 year, no significant difference was observed in the composite secondary endpoint (91.7% vs. 86.0%, P = 0.605). Both groups showed similar improvements in echocardiographic and clinical outcomes. Additionally, no statistically significant differences were observed between the two groups regarding post-TPVR regurgitation and paravalvular leakage. TPVR using self-expanding valves in pyramidal RVOT showed acceptable device success rates and favorable mid-term outcomes in both clinical and hemodynamic parameters. Morphology-based pre-procedural planning is essential for optimizing results.","['Wenhao Zhu', 'Zhiyuan Xia', 'Jeffery Shi Kai Chan', 'Junyi Wan', 'Liang Xu', 'Yihang Li', 'Jingnan Zhang', 'Gary Tse', 'Fang Fang', 'Gejun Zhang']",Pediatric cardiology,2025-05-12,10.1007/s00246-025-03876-8,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00246-025-03876-8,PMC6398292,Free,Feasibility of Self Expanding Transcatheter Pulmonary Valves in Patients with Pyramidal RVOT Favorable Mid term Outcomes ZHU 2025,pdfs\Feasibility of Self Expanding Transcatheter Pulmonary Valves in Patients with Pyramidal RVOT Favorable Mid term Outcomes ZHU 2025.pdf,"['STROBE guidelines', 'study', 'observational study', 'STROBE', 'Transcatheter Pulmonary Valves', 'study design', 'observational', 'guidelines', 'pyramidal RVOT patients', 'Transcatheter Pulmonary']",2025-05-14,Pending,"['Computed tomography', 'Congenital heart disease', 'Transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement']"
