40424007,"An oxidized chondroitin sulfate-crosslinked and CuCDs-loaded decellularized bovine pericardium with improved anti-coagulation, pro-endothelialization and anti-calcification properties for BHVs.","With the growth of the elderly people and the development of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) technology, bioprosthetic heart valves (BHVs) originating from the decellularized bovine pericardium (DBP) have become a favourable option for severe valvular heart disease (VHD). However, currently, available commercial bioprosthetic heart valves prepared from glutaraldehyde (GA)-crosslinked xenografts have limited durability because of various factors, including severe cytotoxicity, inflammatory response, poor pro-endothelialization ability and calcification. Therefore, the development of valve materials with better performance is urgent. In this work, we first synthesized Cu-doped carbon dots (CuCDs) with excellent biocompatibility and high stability using sodium citrate, ethylenediamine and copper chloride. Subsequently, oxidized chondroitin sulfate (OCS) was used to crosslink the decellularized bovine pericardium to obtain OCS-BP followed by loading CuCDs onto the surface of this OCS-fixed BP sample through amide bonds formed by an EDC/NHS-catalyzed reaction between the functional groups on CuCDs and OCS-BP to prepare the BHV (CuCDs-OCS-BP) with specific properties. Relevant experiments conducted both in vivo and in vitro indicate that CuCDs-OCS-BP with good stability showed improved mechanical properties, compliance and flexibility, encouraging HUVEC-cytocompatibility, excellent anti-blood cell adhesion, antithrombogenic properties, anti-inflammatory and anti-calcification properties, and a good endothelialisation ability due to the catalytic generation of endogenous nitric oxide. Overall, CuCDs-OCS-BP is a promising material for BHVs.","['Shubin Shi', 'Xu Wei', 'Xu Peng', 'Xinyun Pu', 'Shaoxiong Feng', 'Xi Gao', 'Xixun Yu']",Journal of materials chemistry.

Following the PRISMA guidelines, we included both non-randomized studies and randomized clinical trials that reported AKI criteria and patients' surgical risk in patients with aortic stenosis by searching PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science until late September. We executed a random-effects model in Review Manager to pool effect estimates of AKI incidence or the need for dialysis as an odds ratio (OR) and I2 heterogeneity, and we utilized R for meta-regression to address any heterogeneity with subgroup analysis for surgical risk, AKI criteria, and study design. We used the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS) and the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool (RoB-1) for risk of bias assessment and GRADE for certainty assessment. Involving 17 studies and a total of 13,777 patients, we found that the AKI incidence was significantly lower in TAVR compared to SAVR (OR = 0.36; 95% CI: [0.30, 0.44], I2 = 55%, P = 0.003), along with the need for dialysis (OR = 0.35; 95% CI: [0.19, 0.63], I2 = 0%, P = 0.92). The study also found that intermediate and low-risk patients had more favorable outcomes. However, the retrospective study design and VARC-2 criteria were associated with unfavorable outcomes. TAVR effectively reduced the risk of AKI in all surgical risk categories and the need for dialysis compared to SAVR in patients with AS.","['Ahmad Alazzam', 'Yacoub Aldroubi', 'Tariq Alhusban', 'Mosab Said']",Cardiovascular intervention and therapeutics,2025-05-27,10.1007/s12928-025-01144-3,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12928-025-01144-3,PMC8054375,Free,Comprehensive analysis of acute kidney injury incidence following transcatheter versus surgical aortic valve replacement in aortic stenosis a systematic review and meta analysis of 13 777 patients ALAZZAM 2025,pdfs\Comprehensive analysis of acute kidney injury incidence following transcatheter versus surgical aortic valve replacement in aortic stenosis .pdf,"['acute kidney injury', 'TAVI', 'surgical aortic valve', 'aortic valve', 'aortic valve replacement', 'patients', 'Cardiovascular Intervention Society', 'valve', 'British Cardiovascular Intervention', 'transcatheter aortic valve']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['AKI', 'Dialysis', 'Meta-analysis', 'SAVR', 'TAVI', 'TAVR']"
40422955,One-Year Outcome of Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement with Concomitant SignificantTricuspid Regurgitation.,"Background: The outcome of patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) can be affected by coexisting tricuspid regurgitation (TR). The aim of the study is to investigate the clinical results of patients undergoing TAVR with or without concomitant significant TR. Methods: Patients undergoing TAVR were divided into two groups according to TR severity: none/mild TR (low-grade) and moderate/severe TR (significant). Data were analysed and compared. Primary endpoint was the mortality 1-year. Secondary endpoints were re-hospitalization and the degree of postoperative and 1-year TR. Results: TAVR procedures were performed in 345 patients between September 2011 and February 2020. Median STS score was 4.3% (IQR: 2.6-7.2), median LVEF was 59.0% (IQR: 45.0-62.0), median aortic area was 0.70cm2 (IQR: 0.60-0.86), median mean gradient was 43.0mmHg (IQR: 36.0-53.0). Before TAVR, 297 patients (86.1%) had low-grade TR and 48 (13.9%) significant TR. Mean age was 82.4 ± 5.7 and 83.8 ± 6.2 years in low-grade and significant TR group, respectively (p = 0.109), with 47.5% (low-grade TR) and 56.3% (significant TR) of female patients (p = 0.279). Patients showed differences in EuroSCORE-II (3.2% (IQR: 1.9-5.7) in low-grade TR vs. 5.6% (IQR: 3.7-8.1) in significant TR; p < 0.001), impaired right ventricular function (3.0% vs. 20.8%; p < 0.001) and pulmonary hypertension (9.1% vs. 39.6%; p < 0.001). Mean valve size was 27.7 ± 2.9 mm. Hospital mortality was 2.0% in low-grade TR and 4.2% in significantTR patients (p = 0.308). Among discharged patients (n = 337), seven patients died within 30 days (2.0% low-grade TR; 2.1% significant TR; logrank test p = 0.154) and 40 were re-hospitalized for heart failure (11.1% low-grade TR; 14.6% significant TR; p = 0.470). After one year, 26 patients died, corresponding to a mortality of 7.9 deaths per 100-person year (95% CI 5.2-12.0) in low-grade TR group and 9.1 deaths per 100-person year (95% CI 3.4-24.3) in significant TR group (logrank test p = 0.815), with HR (low grade vs. significant TR) of 0.87, 95% CI 0.26-2.89. Re-hospitalization for heart failure was 16.5% and 19.6% for low-grade and significant TR, respectively (p = 0.713). Echocardiographic and functional changes over time showed no significant interaction between TR and time. Conclusions: In our experience, patients undergoing TAVR showed similar 30-day and 1-year outcome and re-hospitalization rate, regardless of the degree of concomitant tricuspid regurgitation.","['Enrico Ferrari', 'Alberto Pozzoli', 'Catherine Klersy', 'Elena Caporali', 'Stefanos Demertzis', 'Giovanni Pedrazzini']",Journal of cardiovascular development and disease,2025-05-14,10.3390/jcdd12050184,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcdd12050184,,Paid,One Year Outcome of Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement with Concomitant SignificantTricuspid Regurgitation FERRARI 2025,Not available,"['Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'patients undergoing TAVR', 'Patients Undergoing Transcatheter', 'Patients Undergoing', 'undergoing TAVR', 'Concomitant SignificantTricuspid Regurgitation', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'Undergoing Transcatheter']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['aortic valve stenosis', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement', 'tricuspid valve regurgitation']"

Surgical aortic valve replacement remains the standard treatment for symptomatic patients. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is an alternative for those at high surgical risk; however, its use is limited by higher complication rates and the lack of suitable valve options. Previously, balloon-expandable valves were available only in sizes up to 32 mm, restricting their application in patients with larger aortic annuli. We report the first use of the 35 mm balloon-expandable Myval XXL valve with a long 24 French Python introducer sheath for TAVR in a patient with non-calcific aortic regurgitation and an annular area of 722 mm². This case highlights a potential advancement in TAVR technology, expanding treatment options for patients with non-calcific aortic regurgitation with large annuli previously considered ineligible for TAVR.","['Jayesh Bhaskaran', 'Ignacio J Amat Santos', 'Ashraf Safiya Manzil', 'Asishkumar Mandalay']",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,2025-05-27,10.1002/ccd.31632,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.31632,,Paid,Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Pure Native Valve Aortic Regurgitation Using a 35 mm Balloon Expandable Myval XXL Valve and a 24 French Python BZ Smart Introducer Sheath BHASKARAN 2025,Not available,"['Pure Native Valve', 'Native Valve Aortic', 'Smart Introducer Sheath', 'Myval XXL Valve', 'Pure Native', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Balloon-Expandable Myval XXL', 'Smart Introducer', 'Native Valve', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve']",2025-05-27,Pending,[]
40421696,Effectiveness and Safety of Myval Versus Other Transcatheter Valves in Patients Undergoing TAVI: A Meta-Analysis.,"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has changed the treatment of aortic stenosis. The Myval transcatheter heart valve (THV), a novel balloon-expandable THV, has shown promising outcomes. Our aim is to compare the comparative safety and effectiveness of Myval THV against established THVs, such as Sapien and Evolut. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted, comparing the Myval THV with other contemporary THVs. Primary endpoints were periprocedural, 30-day and 1-year all-cause mortality. Seven studies involving 3106 patients (1027 Myval; 2079 other THVs) were included. No significant differences were observed in the primary endpoints. Myval demonstrated higher procedural success (RR: 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01-1.07, I² = 29%) and lower rates of permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI) during the index hospitalization (RR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.36-0.92, I² = 23%) and 30-days (RR: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.40-0.89, I² = 43%), compared to other THV. At 30-day, Myval was associated with lower rates of moderate or severe transvalvular aortic regurgitation (RR: 0.33, 95% CI: 0.11-0.98, I² = 57%) and minor vascular complications (RR: 0.45, 95% CI: 0.23-0.90, I² = 0%). When compared to self-expandable THV, Myval was associated with higher procedural and device success, higher early safety, lower risk for PPI, minor vascular complications and at least moderate transvalvular AR. When compared to Sapien, procedural success and risk for in-hospital PPI was borderline higher and lower in favor of Myval, respectively. The Myval THV demonstrates comparable safety and effectiveness to contemporary THVs, with advantages in procedural success, PPI, and vascular complications.","['Anastasios Apostolos', 'Nikolaos Ktenopoulos', 'Maria Drakopoulou', 'Alfonso Ielasi', 'Vasileios Panoulas', 'Andreas Baumbach', 'Konstantinos Tsioufis', 'Patrick Serruys', 'Konstantinos Toutouzas']",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,2025-05-27,10.1002/ccd.31611,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.31611,,Paid,Effectiveness and Safety of Myval Versus Other Transcatheter Valves in Patients Undergoing TAVI A Meta Analysis APOSTOLOS 2025,Not available,"['Patients Undergoing TAVI', 'Undergoing TAVI', 'Myval Versus', 'Myval', 'Myval THV', 'Patients Undergoing', 'THV', 'Myval transcatheter heart', 'TAVI', 'Transcatheter aortic valve']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['TAVR', 'aortic valve', 'balloon‐expandable', 'self‐expandable', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study on a cohort of consecutive patients who underwent TAVR utilizing Myval THV from September 2021 to August 2023 at a tertiary care cardiac center. We collected baseline characteristics, pre- and post-procedural echocardiographic findings, procedural details, in-hospital outcomes, VARC-3 technical success, and complications. Additionally, patients were followed up for 3 months concerning their clinical outcomes.
RESULTS: The study population comprised 92 TAVR patients with a mean age of 76.8 ± 7.3 years, 66.3% were male, and the mean STS score was 5.9 ± 3.2%. The most common valve sizes used were 24.5 mm (30.4%), 23 mm (26.1%), and 27.5 mm (17.4%). Pre-dilation was performed in 32 cases (34.8%), achieving a 93.5% technical success rate. In-hospital mortality occurred in three patients (3.3%), which included one annulus rupture. Permanent pacemaker implantation was required in six patients (6.5%). Three patients (3.3%) exhibited 3+ paravalvular leakage demonstrated by angiography. The New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class showed significant improvement from baseline to discharge (p < 0.0001). At the 3-month follow-up, five patients encountered mortality (5.4), and three experienced an episode of stroke or transient ischemic attack (3.2%). Two other patients were hospitalized due to cardiovascular events during the 3-month follow-up.

40421252,The Impact of Malnutrition on Perioperative Ischemic Stroke in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR): A Retrospective Cohort Study of the National Inpatient Sample.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Ischemic stroke is a serious risk for patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). The relationship between malnutrition and post-TAVR ischemic stroke remains unclear. This study investigates this association using the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) data.
METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted using NIS data from 2012 to 2021. We included patients who underwent TAVR and were diagnosed with malnutrition based on ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes. Patients under 18 years, with a history of preoperative stroke, with both ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, or with incomplete data were excluded. Logistic regression was performed to evaluate the association between malnutrition and ischemic stroke, adjusting for potential confounders. Sensitivity analyses included stratified analysis and propensity score matching.
RESULTS: Among 364,580 TAVR patients, 10,415 (2.86%) were diagnosed with malnutrition. Malnourished patients were older (78.04 vs. 77.40), predominantly white (85.69%), and had a higher incidence of ischemic stroke (11.47% vs. 7.25%, p < 0.001). After adjusting for common ischemic stroke risk factors, malnutrition was significantly associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke (aOR: 1.51; 95% CI: 1.31-1.74). This association remained significant in the propensity-matched cohort. Subgroup analyses consistently showed associations between malnutrition and stroke risk across various demographic and clinical factors. Time trend analysis showed no significant difference in the annual incidence of perioperative ischemic stroke between malnourished patients with or without cerebral embolic protection devices (p = 0.439).
CONCLUSION: Malnutrition is associated with a higher risk of ischemic stroke following TAVR, highlighting the need for targeted interventions.","['Haowei Li', 'Guangzhi Cong', 'Xueping Ma', 'Bo Shi', 'Congyan Ye', 'Rui Yan', 'Shizhe Fu', 'Kairu Wang', 'Shaobin Jia', 'Jingjing Wang']",Health science reports,2025-05-27,10.1002/hsr2.70860,https://doi.org/10.1002/hsr2.70860,PMC12104818,Free,The Impact of Malnutrition on Perioperative Ischemic Stroke in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement TAVR A Retrospective Cohort Study of the National Inpatient Sample LI 2025,pdfs\The Impact of Malnutrition on Perioperative Ischemic Stroke in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement TAVR A Retrospective Cohort Study of t.pdf,"['Ischemic Stroke', 'Ningxia Medical University', 'TAVR', 'TAVR ischemic stroke', 'National Inpatient Sample', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Ischemic', 'Stroke', 'Ningxia Medical', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['cerebral embolic protection', 'ischemic stroke', 'malnutrition', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"
40420013,Two birds with one stone: pre-TAVI coronary CT angiography combined with FFR helps screen for coronary stenosis.,"OBJECTIVES: Since coronary artery disease (CAD) is a common comorbidity in patients with aortic valve stenosis, invasive coronary angiography (ICA) can be avoided if significant CAD can be screened with the non-invasive coronary CT angiography (cCTA). This study aims to evaluate the ability of machine learning-based CT coronary fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR) derived from cCTA to aid in the diagnosis of comorbid CAD in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).
METHODS: A total of 100 patients who underwent both cCTA and ICA assessments prior to TAVI procedure between January 2021 and July 2023 were included. Coronary stenosis was assessed using both cCTA data and machine learning-generated CT-FFR image information for patients/major coronary vessels. Coronary lesions with CT-FFR ≤ 0.80 were defined as hemodynamically significant, with ICA serving as the diagnostic gold standard.
RESULTS: A total of 400 major coronary vessels were identified in 100 eligible patients who underwent TAVI. CT-FFR was 86.4% sensitive and 66.1% specific to diagnose CAD, with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 66.7% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 86.0%. The diagnostic accuracy (Acc) was 75.0%, with a false positive rate (FPR) of 33.9%. At the vessel level, CT-FFR showed a sensitivity of 77.6% and a specificity of 76.9%. The PPV was 44.0% and the NPV was 93.6%. The Acc was 77.0% and the FPR was 23.1%. For all patient/vessel units, CT-FFR outperformed cCTA.
CONCLUSION: Machine learning-based CT-FFR can effectively detect coronary hemodynamic abnormalities. Combined with preoperative cCTA in TAVI patients, it is an effective tool to rule out significant CAD, reducing unnecessary coronary angiography in this high-risk population.

40418351,Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) after transcatheter aortic valve implantation in aortic stenosis patients: exploring a novel threshold for clinically significant improvement after 12 months.,"AIM: The study aimed to determine the proportion of patients with significant improvements in Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) 12 months after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI), using a threshold for physical function (PF) and physical role (RP) domains of the SF-36 questionnaire. Additionally, we explored shared baseline characteristics of patients reporting these improvements.
METHODOLOGY: In this prospective observational study, 88 patients with symptomatic, severe aortic stenosis (AS) and preserved ejection fraction were enrolled between April 2017 and February 2020. Exclusion criteria were clinical instability, pacemaker, chronic AF, comorbidities with life expectancy < 1 year. HRQoL was evaluated before and 12 months after transfemoral TAVI using the Norwegian version 2.0 of SF-36, and presented as mean (95% confidence interval). Other outcome measures were 6-minute walking test and NYHA- classification. Independent samples t-test or Mann-Whitney U test was used for between-group comparisons as appropriate. Logistic regression or Chi2-test were used to explore associations between changes in PF and RP and clinical parameters. Statistical significance was set at p ≤ 0.05, and clinically significant changes in HRQoL were defined as increase of ≥ 15 points in the PF and RP categories.
RESULTS: Mean age of the cohort was 80 ± 6 years. 44 (50%) patients reported clinically significant improvement in PF, and 46 (52%) in the RP domain. Baseline scores were significantly lower in patients reporting clinical improvement after TAVI, with PF scores pre intervention 43.07 (37.37-48.78) vs. 65.34 (59.01-71.68), p < 0.001, and RP 36.01 (29.56-42.46) vs. 59.92 (50.91-68.92), p < 0.001. No significant associations were found between improvement in domain scores and parameters from the routine baseline examination, but having ≥ 15-point improvement correlated to baseline PF and RP scores.
CONCLUSION: Our study highlights the importance of defining a uniform threshold for clinically significant improvement in the SF-36 HRQoL questionnaire for patients undergoing TAVI. Half of the patients reported favorable long-term outcome for PF and RP aspects of SF-36. This emphasizes the importance of HRQoL assessment in the preoperative work up for patients undergoing TAVI.

Severe aortic stenosis is in the elderly treated with transcatheter aortic valve implantation, aiming to improve survival and relieve symptoms. Health- related quality of life is an important outcome to measure after the procedure. However, there are no defined values for what constitutes a significant improvement in this patient group when measuring quality of life using the widely used health-related quality of life questionnaire SF-36.Our study aimed to investigate how many patients had clinically important improvement in physical aspects of quality of life one year after valve implantation. Eighty-eight patients with an average age of 80 years were included. We proposed a new threshold of 15 points for improvement in the physical function and physical role domains of the questionnaire. We found that half of the patients improved in quality of life, and those who improved had lower scores before surgery.The study emphasizes the need for a clear standard for improvement in quality of life in these patients, highlighting the value of assessment of quality of life before and after TAVI.","['Marte Sævik', 'Marit Helen Andersen', 'Jan Otto Beitnes', 'Lars Aaberge', 'Per Steinar Halvorsen']",Journal of patient-reported outcomes,2025-05-26,10.1186/s41687-025-00894-1,https://doi.org/10.1186/s41687-025-00894-1,PMC10598915,Free,Health Related Quality of Life HRQoL after transcatheter aortic valve implantation in aortic stenosis patients exploring a novel threshold for clinically significant improvement after 12 months SÆVIK 2025,pdfs\Health Related Quality of Life HRQoL after transcatheter aortic valve implantation in aortic stenosis patients exploring a novel threshold f.pdf,"['aortic valve implantation', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'Quality of Life', 'aortic valve', 'surgical aortic valve', 'aortic valve replacement', 'TAVI', 'aortic', 'valve implantation', 'Quality']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['Aortic stenosis (AS)', 'Health related quality of life (HRQoL)', 'Minimal clinically important difference (MCID)', 'SF-36', 'Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI)']"
40417940,An evaluation of the SavvyWire as a support wire for TAVR procedures.,"Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) represents a minimally invasive alternative for the treatment of severe symptomatic aortic stenosis and is increasingly adopted in younger and lower-risk patients. A support guidewire placed in the left ventricle is required in all TAVR procedures, and rapid ventricular pacing is frequently used to ensure valve implant stability. Also, recent studies showed a correlation between post-TAVR hemodynamic gradients and clinical outcomes, underscoring the importance of accurate invasive measurements. The SavvyWire™ (Opsens Medical) is a novel support guidewire designed for TAVR procedures that integrates left ventricular pacing and invasive pressure measurement capabilities, enabling continuous hemodynamic monitoring and simplifying the procedure. This review outlines the SavvyWire's™ design features and summarizes clinical evidence supporting its use in TAVR procedures.
What is this article about?This Device Evaluation article focuses on the new transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) support guidewire, the SavvyWire™ (Opsens Medical), an innovative solution that, besides providing proper support for the TAVR procedure, features integrated dedicated ventricular pacing capabilities and a built-in pressure sensor in its distal tip. These functionalities allow its use for rapid pacing for valve implantation and intraprocedural invasive transvalvular assessment, thereby streamlining TAVR procedures and clinical decision-making processes.What were the results?The safety and efficacy of the SavvyWire™ have been demonstrated inthree prospective observational TAVR studies, with effective left ventricular rapid pacing and accurate pressure recordings in the vast majority of cases. Additionally, the support provided by the SavvyWire was comparable to or superior than that of other TAVR workhorse support wires.What do the results of the study mean?This novel TAVR support guidewire can provide safe and effective rapid pacing for valve implantation and accurate direct transvalvular hemodynamic measurements. These additional features make this guidewire an appealing option during TAVR since it can simplify the procedure and help to optimize procedural results.","['Julio I Farjat-Pasos', 'Marisa Avvedimento', 'Josep Rodes-Cabau']",Future cardiology,2025-05-26,10.1080/14796678.2025.2509458,https://doi.org/10.1080/14796678.2025.2509458,,Paid,An evaluation of the SavvyWire as a support wire for TAVR procedures FARJAT-PASOS 2025,Not available,"['TAVR procedures', 'TAVR', 'TAVR support guidewire', 'Opsens Medical', 'support', 'support guidewire', 'pacing', 'SavvyWire', 'procedures', 'ventricular pacing']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['Transcatheter aortic valve replacement', 'innovation', 'invasive hemodynamics', 'left ventricle pacing', 'support guidewire']"

METHODS: In total, 509 patients with severe aortic stenosis who underwent TAVR at 3 tertiary centers were retrospectively included and divided into 2 groups according to changes in LV pre-A pressure after TAVR: Group 1, with no change or decrease in pre-A pressure, and Group 2, presenting an increase in pre-A pressure after TAVR. The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause death and rehospitalization for heart failure.
RESULTS: Group 1 included 39% (n=198) patients, and Group 2 had 61% (n=311) patients. More patients in Group 2 had diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and a larger aortic valve area than in Group 1. During the follow-up period (median, 28 months), 122 primary outcomes were recorded. In Kaplan-Meier analysis, the cumulative incidence of the primary outcome and all-cause death was significantly lower in Group 1 than in Group 2. In multivariable Cox hazard models, Group 1 was independently associated with a favorable primary outcome (hazard ratio, 0.52 [95% CI, 0.34-0.80]; P=0.003).
CONCLUSIONS: Increase in LV pre-A pressure after TAVR is common, and no change or decrease in LV pre-A pressure after TAVR is independently associated with favorable outcomes. Changes in LV pre-A pressure can help identify patient subsets who will maximally benefit from TAVR.","['Jiwon Seo', 'Ah-Ram Kim', 'Iksung Cho', 'Chi Young Shim', 'Geu-Ru Hong', 'Eui-Young Choi', 'Se-Joong Rim', 'Young-Guk Ko', 'Myeong-Ki Hong', 'Jae-Kwan Song', 'Jong-Won Ha']",Journal of the American Heart Association,2025-05-26,10.1161/JAHA.124.039372,https://doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.124.039372,,Paid,Impact of Left Ventricular Diastolic Pressure Changes on Clinical Outcomes After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement SEO 2025,Not available,"['Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Left Ventricular Diastolic', 'Ventricular Diastolic Pressure', 'Left Ventricular', 'pre-A pressure', 'Valve Replacement', 'Diastolic Pressure', 'Aortic Valve', 'TAVR']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['aortic stenosis', 'diastolic function', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"
40415983,A Retrospective Analysis Assessing Paravalvular Leak and Pacemaker Implantation Using TEE and Non-Contrast CT for CKD Patients Compared With CT Angiography for Annular Sizing Pre-TAVR.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become the treatment of choice for many patients with severe aortic stenosis. Proper pre-procedure sizing of the aortic annulus is crucial in preventing post-TAVR complications. This is typically performed with CT angiography, but the use of contrast is controversial in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).
METHODS: This study of 557 patients from 2016 to 2021 sought to evaluate a contrast-sparing protocol for balloon expandable TAVR evaluation in patients with CKD, in which patients with glomerular filtration rate of less than 40 would undergo transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) and CT without contrast (83 patients) for aortic annular sizing instead of CT angiography (445 patients).
RESULTS: We found that there was no significant difference in rates of greater than trace or greater than mild paravalvular leak between the two groups at hospital discharge, 30 days, or 1-year post-TAVR. We also found no difference in rates of permanent pacemaker implantation at these same time points.
CONCLUSIONS: This suggests that TEE and non-contrast CT could be a viable alternative to CTA in patients with CKD, although more research into other variables such as mortality and other post-procedural complications is necessary.","[""Michael O'Shaughnessy"", 'Roxana Tabrizi', 'Derek Pham', 'Nicholas Jackson', 'Olcay Aksoy', 'Andre Akhondi', 'Jeanne Huchting', 'Richard Shemin', 'Murray Kwon', 'Peyman Benharash', 'Brandon Kim', 'Amir Rabbani']",Health science reports,2025-05-27,10.1002/hsr2.70847,https://doi.org/10.1002/hsr2.70847,PMC12098966,Free,A Retrospective Analysis Assessing Paravalvular Leak and Pacemaker Implantation Using TEE and Non Contrast CT for CKD Patients Compared With CT Angiography for Annular Sizing Pre TAVR O'SHAUGHNESSY 2025,pdfs\A Retrospective Analysis Assessing Paravalvular Leak and Pacemaker Implantation Using TEE and Non Contrast CT for CKD Patients Compared With.pdf,"['Patients', 'TAVR', 'TEE', 'David Geffen School', 'Annular Sizing', 'CKD Patients Compared', 'contrast', 'Los Angeles', 'Paravalvular Leak', 'aortic annular sizing']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['TAVR', 'aortic stenosis', 'pacemaker implantation', 'paravalvular leak', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"
40414715,Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes of Cardiac Surgery and Transcatheter Procedures in Patients With Adult Congenital Heart Disease　- Insights From Japanese Registry Data.,"BACKGROUND: Adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) patients often require additional interventions or surgeries in adulthood, presenting new clinical challenges. However, clinical research on the current status and outcomes of cardiac procedures in ACHD patients remains limited.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We analyzed the Japanese Registry of All Cardiac and Vascular Diseases-Diagnosis Procedure Combination (JROAD-DPC) database between April 2013 and March 2021. Patients with ACHD (aged >15 years) who underwent major cardiac surgery and transcatheter procedures were included. We assessed clinical background, treatment, length of hospital stay, and in-hospital mortality. In all, 22,490 patients with ACHD (median age 56 years [interquartile range 36-69 years], 51.1% female) were enrolled. Emergency hospitalizations and in-hospital deaths were observed in 3.7% and 1.1% of cases, respectively. Congenital heart operations with high in-hospital mortality (>5.0%) included aortic arch repair, systemic-to-pulmonary artery shunts, cardiac tumor resection, coronary artery bypass grafting, 3-valve replacement, and ventricular assist device implantation. Although stent graft procedures had the highest in-hospital mortality rate (2.6%), other transcatheter procedures, such as transcatheter patent ductus arteriosus closure, atrial septal defect closure, and catheter ablation, had in-hospital mortality rates of <1.0%.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides fundamental insights into the current clinical characteristics and outcomes associated with procedures in patients with ACHD. The in-hospital mortality rates for both cardiac surgery and transcatheter procedures in Japanese ACHD patients were low, demonstrating acceptable outcomes.","['Takumi Osawa', 'Tomoko Machino-Ohtsuka', 'Ruriko Numata', 'Ayako Kuraoka', 'Mike Saji', 'Koshiro Kanaoka', 'Yoko Sumita', 'Naoto Kawamatsu', 'Hideyuki Kato', 'Yuji Hiramatsu', 'Tomoko Ishizu']",Circulation journal : official journal of the Japanese Circulation Society,2025-05-25,10.1253/circj.CJ-24-0843,https://doi.org/10.1253/circj.CJ-24-0843,,Paid,Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes of Cardiac Surgery and Transcatheter Procedures in Patients With Adult Congenital Heart Disease Insights From Japanese Registry Data OSAWA 2025,Not available,"['Adult Congenital Heart', 'Congenital Heart Disease', 'Japanese Registry Data', 'Adult Congenital', 'Registry Data', 'Congenital Heart', 'Heart Disease', 'Japanese ACHD patients', 'Japanese Registry', 'Transcatheter Procedures']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['Adult congenital heart disease', 'Cardiac surgery', 'Congenital heart disease', 'Japanese Registry of All Cardiac and Vascular Diseases-Diagnosis Procedure Combination (JROAD-DPC)', 'Percutaneous interventions']"
40414547,Balancing cost and care: analyzing commercial pricing for TAVR and SAVR.,"In a nationwide examination of commercial prices for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR), we observed substantial markups and variability across hospitals, payers and plan types-including differences exceeding $90,000 among insurers. Higher prices did not consistently correlate with better clinical outcomes, suggesting that factors beyond quality of care drive these pricing differences. These findings underscore the need for greater transparency and further investigation into how pricing structures and market forces affect both cost and quality of care.","['Chen Wei', 'Pranav Sharma', 'Ishan Paranjpe', 'Paul A Heidenreich', 'Kevin Schulman', 'Alexander Sandhu']",American heart journal,2025-05-23,10.1016/j.ahj.2025.05.011,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ahj.2025.05.011,,Paid,Balancing cost and care analyzing commercial pricing for TAVR and SAVR WEI 2025,Not available,"['aortic valve replacement', 'analyzing commercial pricing', 'analyzing commercial', 'valve replacement', 'Balancing cost', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'surgical aortic valve', 'aortic valve', 'SAVR', 'TAVR and SAVR']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['Price transparency', 'SAVR', 'TAVR', 'healthcare spending', 'price variation']"
40413055,Study protocol for an internahaational prospective non-randomised trial evaluating the long-term outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve implantation versus surgical aortic valve replacement for aortic-valve stenosis in patients at risk to severe valve obstruction: the TAVISAR trial.,"BACKGROUND: Aortic valve stenosis (AVS) represents the most prevalent primary valvular lesion necessitating surgical intervention or transcatheter intervention in Europe and North America. Its prevalence is increasing at a rapid rate as a consequence of the ageing population. A variety of mechanical interventions are available to determine the management of AVS; however, there is currently a paucity of robust data with which to perform a comparative analysis of the efficacy of surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) and that of conventional stented xenograft bioprostheses (BP) or sutureless aortic valves (SAV) and transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). The present study aims to compare the effectiveness and clinical outcomes of SAVR using BP or SAV technique and TAVI in patients with severe AVS.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A collaboration between three cardiac surgery centres across two European countries has resulted in the conception of the Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation vs Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement trial. This prospective non-randomised trial is designed to evaluate the long-term outcomes of TAVI in comparison to SAVR for AVS in patients at risk of severe valve obstruction. The registry will enrol successive patients who have undergone mechanical intervention for AVS between January 2015 and December 2025. Investigators will assess the difference between replacement procedures for both the standard surgical approach and the transcatheter procedure. The principal clinical outcome under consideration will be the composite degree of all-cause mortality, ischaemic stroke or rehospitalisation at 10 years. The present study will also have a number of secondary endpoints, including all-cause mortality, followed by functional status, hospitalisation, neurocognition, physiological measures (echocardiographic assessment), adverse events and reoperation.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: It is hypothesised that the nature of the trials will serve to minimise bias related to institutional volume and surgical experience. Each participating centre is required to have an aortic valve programme that enables proper follow-up and management of any late aortic events following replacement surgery for the AVS. The data collected will provide valuable insight into the comparative effectiveness of various surgical approaches, both standardised and advanced, in aortic valve surgery and TAVI. This comprehensive analysis will contribute significantly to the development of robust international guidelines.

40412426,"ACURATE neo2 valve versus commercially available transcatheter heart valves in patients with severe aortic stenosis (ACURATE IDE): a multicentre, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial.","BACKGROUND: ACURATE neo2 is an open-cell, supra-annular, self-expanding transcatheter heart valve that is commercially available in over 50 countries but has not previously been evaluated in a randomised trial. ACURATE-IDE aimed to prospectively evaluate the safety and efficacy of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with the ACURATE neo2 valve compared with commercially available valves for the treatment of severe symptomatic aortic stenosis.
METHODS: In this multicentre, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial, patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis and any level of surgical risk were recruited from 71 medical centres in the USA and Canada. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to TAVR with ACURATE neo2 or one of the control valves, SAPIEN 3 (SAPIEN 3 or SAPIEN 3 Ultra) or Evolut, using permuted block randomisation with a pseudo-random number generator, and stratified by the clinical investigation site and type of control valve. All devices were implanted according to the manufacturer's instructions. The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause mortality, all stroke, and rehospitalisation at 1 year, tested for non-inferiority using a Bayesian approach. The primary analysis was performed in the intention-to-treat population and sensitivity analyses were done in the implanted population. The non-inferiority margin was 8·0%. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03735667, and is ongoing.
FINDINGS: Between June 10, 2019, and April 19, 2023, 1500 patients were recruited, of whom 752 were randomly assigned to the ACURATE neo2 group and 748 to the control group. The median age of participants was 79 years (IQR 74-83). 778 (51·9%) of 1500 patients were female and 721 (48·1%) were male. At 1 year, the posterior median probability of the primary composite endpoint was higher in the ACURATE neo2 group (16·2% [95% Bayesian credible interval 13·4-19·1) than in the control group (9·5% [7·5-11·9]; between-group difference 6·6% [3·0-10·2]). The upper bound of treatment difference exceeded the prespecified non-inferiority margin of 8%, with a posterior probability of treatment difference of >0·999. At 1 year, the ACURATE neo2 group, had significantly higher Kaplan-Meier rates of the composite endpoint of all-cause mortality, all stroke, and rehospitalisation (14·8% [95% CI 12·5-17·6] vs 9·1% [7·2-11·4]; hazard ratio [HR] 1·71 [95% CI 1·26-2·33]; p=0·0005). At 1 year, all-cause mortality occurred in 36 of 752 patients in the ACURATE neo2 group versus 28 of 748 patients in the control group (HR 1·30 [95% CI 0·80-2·14]), stroke in 41 patients versus 25 patients (1·68 [1·02-2·75]), and rehospitalisation in 38 patients versus 25 patients (1·57 [0·95-2·61]). Cardiovascular mortality (3·7% vs 1·8%, p=0·024) and spontaneous myocardial infarction at 1 year (2·4% vs 0·7%, p=0·0092) were more frequent in the ACURATE neo2 group than in the control group. Prosthetic valve aortic regurgitation (central plus paravalvular) at 1 year was significantly more frequent in the ACURATE neo2 group than in the control group (mild aortic regurgitation 42·5% vs 24·8%, p<0·0001; moderate 4·4% vs 1·8%, p=0·0070; severe 0·5% vs 0%; p=0·12).
INTERPRETATION: In patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis, TAVR with ACURATE neo2 did not meet non-inferiority and resulted in significantly worse outcomes with respect to the primary endpoint of composite of all-cause mortality, all stroke, and rehospitalisation at 1 year when compared with commercial valves.

40410432,Efficacy and safety of transfemoral TAVR in pure aortic regurgitation patients: a single center study.,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) via the femoral approach in patients with pure aortic regurgitation (AR), with a focus on mortality, adverse event rates, cardiac function, and clinical symptom improvement. The study utilised a single-centre experience to provide insights and offer guidance for the management of TAVR in AR patients. Patients with aortic valve pathology who underwent TAVR at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, from January 2018 to March 2023 were enrolled. They were classified into two groups: pure AR and aortic stenosis (AS) based on preoperative transthoracic echocardiography. We compared baseline characteristics, imaging data, surgical outcomes, and follow-up conditions between them. We focused on the safety and efficacy of TAVR in patients with AR and evaluated these results using regression analysis. The study cohort comprised 87 patients, with 21 in the AR group and 63 in the AS group. We revealed that AR patients exhibited low mortality and adverse event rates following transfemoral TAVR, with notable improvements in postoperative cardiac function and substantial symptom relief. However, the rates of paravalvular leak (PVL), permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation, and valve-in-valve procedures were relatively elevated. While these findings suggest that TAVR may represent a viable therapeutic option for patients with AR, the elevated rates of PVL, PPM implantation, and readmission underscore the need for further investigation, with larger cohorts and extended follow-up, to more robustly evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of this approach.","['Jie Feng', 'Haixia Wei', 'Shiyuan Zhang', 'Yao Li', 'Hangyu Liu', 'Yanqing Wu']",Scientific reports,2025-05-23,10.1038/s41598-025-03214-1,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-03214-1,PMC12102353,Free,Efficacy and safety of transfemoral TAVR in pure aortic regurgitation patients a single center study FENG 2025,pdfs\Efficacy and safety of transfemoral TAVR in pure aortic regurgitation patients a single center study FENG 2025.pdf,"['TAVR', 'aortic valve', 'aortic', 'patients', 'valve', 'transfemoral TAVR', 'aortic regurgitation patients', 'pure aortic regurgitation', 'Affiliated Hospital', 'aortic valve replacement']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['Aortic regurgitation', 'Aortic stenosis', 'Perivalvular leakage', 'TAVR']"

CASE SUMMARY: An 81-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis and peripheral arterial disease (kissing iliac stents) presented for TAVR. Mild resistance was encountered when introducing the 14-F TAVR catheter through an 18-F sheath, but the catheter passed with gentle pressure. While the catheter was advancing up the aorta, a large, calcified mass was seen moving with the distal tip. Retraction of the catheter also retracted the seemingly attached calcific mass. Angiography revealed a catheter-induced avulsed atheroma but no perforation.
DISCUSSION: The TAVR delivery catheter was carefully removed, and the calcific lesion settled infrarenally. Kissing iliac stenting was performed, raising the aortic bifurcation to the juxtarenal aorta and covering the mobile plaque. Angiography showed patent stents with excellent distal aortic and lower extremity runoff.
TAKE-HOME MESSAGES: Although rare, aortic complications can be devastating.

40408797,Impact of Noncoaxial Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation on Clinical Outcomes.,"BACKGROUND: Noncoaxial placement of transcatheter heart valves (THVs) relative to the native aortic annulus is occasionally detected on fluoroscopy after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the impact of noncoaxial TAVR deployment on clinical outcomes.
METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated consecutive patients undergoing transfemoral TAVR in the Bern transcatheter aortic valve implantation registry. Coaxiality between the native annulus and the THV was measured using the 3-cusp view on fluoroscopic images and was defined as the angle between a line intersecting the lower points of native cusps and a line intersecting the lower hinge points of the prosthesis frame. Patients were categorized according to tertiles of coaxiality.
RESULTS: Among 2,025 patients (mean age 81.6 ± 6.5 years, mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality 4.2% ± 3.3%) undergoing TAVR with contemporary devices between February 2014 and June 2023, the mean axial angulation of the device relative to the native annulus was 4.1°. According to Valve Academic Research Consortium-3 criteria, patients in the highest tertile of THV axial angle (range, 4.8-21.7°) had reduced device early safety (56.2% vs 82.7%; aHR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.59-0.76; P < 0.001) and higher rates of stage-2 bioprosthetic valve failure at 1-year follow-up (1.5% vs 0.7%; HR: 3.47; 95% CI: 1.26-9.54; P = 0.016), compared to those with coaxial valve positioning (range, 0.1-3.0). Left ventricle outflow tract calcium volume, predilatation, and valve type were independent predictors of noncoaxial valve implantation.

Among patients with acute decompensated aortic stenosis, this study aimed to assess the impact of time to transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) on outcomes, hypothesizing that longer durations are associated with worse outcomes.
METHODS: Using a single-center registry, patients with their first presentation of acute decompensated aortic stenosis who underwent an urgent TAVI during their index admission were included. Time to TAVI was defined as the number of days between hospital admission and TAVI. The primary composite outcome was heart failure hospitalization or all-cause mortality. The secondary composite outcome was heart failure hospitalization or cardiovascular mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 276 patients were included in this study: age 84 (79-88) years, male sex 63.7%, patients requiring cardiopulmonary organ support 3.6%, aortic valve area 0.7 (0.5-0.8) cm2, and left ventricular ejection fraction 55 (37-57)%. Baseline characteristics were similar between patients stratified according to the median time to TAVI (22 [13-32] days). Over a follow-up of 4.6 (3.6-5.7) years, the primary and secondary outcomes occurred in 58% and 35% of patients, respectively. After adjusting for comorbidities, mean gradient, and cardiopulmonary organ support, time to TAVI was associated with both the primary (hazard ratio for every 5 days, 1.09 [95% CI, 1.04-1.16]; P=0.001) and secondary outcomes (hazard ratio for every 5 days, 1.08 [95% CI, 1.01-1.16]; P=0.023).

40402169,Long-term results of transcatheter aortic valve replacement in degenerated surgical aortic valves-a propensity score matched analysis.,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to analyse long-term valve function and all-cause mortality of patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) due to degenerated surgical aortic valve (SAV) bioprostheses.
METHODS: In this single-center study, all consecutive patients undergoing TAVR between December 2012 and December 2020 were included. Long-term echocardiographic results, functional status and 5-year all-cause mortality were analysed in patients with TAV-in-SAV and native valve TAVR in a propensity score matched analysis.
RESULTS: Out of 3423 patients who were eligible for the study, 136 experienced bioprosthetic valve dysfunction, whereas 3287 patients underwent native valve TAVR. After 2:1 propensity score matching, baseline characteristics without relation to prior SAVR were comparable between both groups. Regarding 5-year all-cause mortality, no difference was observed between patients with prior SAVR and native valve TAVR, in either unadjusted analysis, or after propensity score matching (corresponding hazard ratio: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.70-1.30, p = 0.75). In addition, while pressure gradients were higher in patients with TAV-in-SAV in long-term echocardiographic follow-up, moderate or severe hemodynamic valve deterioration did not occur more often in this group.
CONCLUSIONS: In this propensity score matched analysis, long-term all-cause mortality and echocardiographic valve function of patients with TAVR in prior bioprosthesis were comparable to patients with native valve TAVR.","['Kornelia Löw', 'Julius Steffen', 'Nike Knufinke', 'Carolin Fröhlich', 'Julius Fischer', 'Magda Haum', 'Hans Theiss', 'Sven Peterss', 'Konstantin Stark', 'Jörg Hausleiter', 'Steffen Massberg', 'Simon Deseive']",Clinical research in cardiology : official journal of the German Cardiac Society,2025-05-22,10.1007/s00392-025-02670-z,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00392-025-02670-z,PMC10984572,Free,Long term results of transcatheter aortic valve replacement in degenerated surgical aortic valves a propensity score matched analysis LÖW 2025,pdfs\Long term results of transcatheter aortic valve replacement in degenerated surgical aortic valves a propensity score matched analysis LW 202.pdf,"['aortic valve', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'surgical aortic valve', 'valve', 'aortic valve implantation', 'severe aortic valve', 'aortic valve replacement', 'aortic', 'native valve TAVR', 'bioprosthetic aortic valves']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['Aortic stenosis', 'Bioprosthetic valve', 'Transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"
40401761,Economic option value associated with surgical aortic valve replacement using a novel bioprosthetic and a future transcatheter aortic valve-in-valve procedure.,"INTRODUCTION: Optimal lifetime management of surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) patients should account for the expected clinical and economic value of the index procedure as well as the future trajectory of health outcomes. This study estimates the discounted per surgery ""total value"" (from the time of initial SAVR operation through 25 years post-surgery) and the option value (after reoperation) that mechanical SAVR patients forego by choosing a device that does not allow for valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve reoperation (ViV/TAVR).
METHODS: The model adopts a US payer perspective and tracks major health events, anti-coagulant monitoring, maintenance, and expenditures associated with these events following initial SAVR procedures, inclusive of costs before and after a potential reoperation. We compare the expected utilization and expenditures for tissue valve patients and mechanical valve patients over a 25-year period. The model also compares the experience of mechanical SAVR patients after reoperation to a counterfactual group receiving ViV/TAVR to estimate option value. Monte Carlo simulation, sensitivity analyses, scenario analyses, and break-even analyses were conducted to account for variation in inputs.
RESULTS: Novel SAVR treatment for aortic stenosis followed by ViV TAVR for reoperation reduces 25-year payer expenditures relative to mechanical valves by either $34,621 (95% CI: 17,426-52,218), $31,363 (95% CI: $19,871 -$43,399) or $23,303 (95% CI: $16,906-$30,075) depending on the age of initial SAVR operation. During this period, the ""option value"" share of overall savings ranges from 8-17% and generally is lower for older patients. Reoperation and anti-coagulant monitoring are important drivers of overall savings and option value.
CONCLUSION: The deterministic and simulation models both demonstrate that novel SAVR tissue valves, followed by a ViV/TAVR, result in lower 25-year expected costs than a treatment strategy using mechanical SAVR valves, and option value is a component of these savings.","['Eric L Keuffel', 'Matt Reifenberger', 'Andrew Pellegrini', 'Pradeep Yadav', 'Vinod H Thourani']",Journal of medical economics,2025-12-27,10.1080/13696998.2025.2503664,https://doi.org/10.1080/13696998.2025.2503664,,Paid,Economic option value associated with surgical aortic valve replacement using a novel bioprosthetic and a future transcatheter aortic valve in valve procedure KEUFFEL 2025,Not available,"['surgical aortic valve', 'aortic valve replacement', 'SAVR', 'mechanical SAVR patients', 'initial SAVR', 'mechanical SAVR', 'initial SAVR operation', 'aortic valve', 'initial SAVR procedures', 'mechanical SAVR valves']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['I10', 'I11', 'I18', 'RESILIA', 'Surgical aortic valve replacement', 'bioprosthetic aortic valve', 'health economics', 'option value', 'outcomes research']"
40399991,Impact of SGLT2-inhibitors on acute kidney injury in diabetic patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).,"BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is associated with significantly worse outcomes, leading to increased short- and long-term mortality. We sought to evaluate the impact of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) on the risk of AKI in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and severe aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing TAVI.
METHODS: Multicenter international registry of consecutive T2DM patients with severe AS undergoing TAVI between 2021 and 2024. The study population was stratified by the presence of chronic kidney disease (CKD), defined according to the KDIGO guideline, and anti-diabetic therapy at hospital admission (SGLT2i versus no-SGLT2i users). AKI was defined according to the Valve Academy Research Consortium 3 (VARC-3) criteria.
RESULTS: The study population consisted of 514 patients stratified into those without CKD (n = 226, 44%), of whom 43 (19%) were treated with SGLT2i, and 288 (56%) with CKD, of whom 71 (24.7%) were on SGLT2i treatment. The median age was 81 [77-84] years, and 60.1% were males. SGLT2i use did not impact renal function in patients without CKD, with AKI occurring in 7.1% of the cases, regardless of SGLT2i use. Among CKD patients, AKI occurred more frequently in no-SGLT2i users compared to those receiving SGLT2i (19.8% versus 8.5%, p = 0.027), with a significant increase in post-TAVI and discharge serum creatinine values for no-SGLT2i users (p = 0.001 after TAVI and p < 0.001 at hospital discharge). Only in the CKD group, the use of SGLT2i was identified as an independent predictor of a lower rate of AKI (OR 0.70, 95%CI 0.42-0.91, p = 0.014). Patients who developed AKI had a higher incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events during follow-up, regardless of CKD (p < 0.025 for both groups).
CONCLUSION: In diabetic patients with CKD undergoing TAVI, SGLT2i therapy was associated with a lower occurrence of AKI compared to those not treated with SGLT2i, suggesting a potential nephroprotective effect in this high-risk population.","['Pasquale Paolisso', 'Marta Belmonte', 'Emanuele Gallinoro', 'Roberto Scarsini', 'Luca Bergamaschi', 'Leonardo Portolan', 'Matteo Armillotta', 'Giuseppe Esposito', 'Elisabetta Moscarella', 'Claudio Montalto', 'Elayne Kelen de Oliveira', 'Francesco Angeli', 'Mateusz Orzalkiewicz', 'Margherita Fabroni', 'Verdiana Galli', 'Nurcan Baydaroglu', 'Francesca Di Lenarda', 'Pasquale Policastro', 'Carlo Terrone', 'Davide Ausiello', 'Giose Vincelli', 'Matteo Casenghi', 'Lucia Scisciola', 'Raffaele Marfella', 'Felice Gragnano', 'Edoardo Conte', 'Dario Pellegrini', 'Alfonso Ielasi', 'Daniele Andreini', 'Jacopo Andrea Oreglia', 'Paolo Calabrò', 'Antonio L Bartorelli', 'Tullio Palmerini', 'Francesco Saia', 'Flavio Ribichini', 'Michelangela Barbieri', 'Marc Vanderheyden', 'Carmine Pizzi', 'Emanuele Barbato']",Cardiovascular diabetology,2025-05-21,10.1186/s12933-025-02773-x,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12933-025-02773-x,PMC12096646,Free,Impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on acute kidney injury in diabetic patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation TAVI PAOLISSO 2025,pdfs\Impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on acute kidney injury in diabetic patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve imp.pdf,"['CKD undergoing TAVI', 'AKI', 'CKD', 'undergoing TAVI', 'TAVI', 'patients', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'aortic valve implantation', 'acute kidney injury', 'aortic valve']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['Acute kidney injury', 'Aortic stenosis', 'Chronic kidney disease', 'SGLT2i', 'Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI)']"
40399075,Prognostic Value of the 6-Minute Walk Test in Patients With Severe Aortic Stenosis.,"BACKGROUND: The prognostic significance of the 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) has not been thoroughly investigated.
METHODS AND RESULTS: This study evaluated 998 patients with severe AS who underwent a 6-min walk test as part of a large multicenter prospective cohort. Patients were categorized as either fast walkers (6MWD ≥300 m; n=515) or slow walkers (6MWD <300 m; n=483). During a median follow-up of 2.3 years, 861 (86.3%) patients underwent surgical or transcatheter aortic valve replacement (AVR; 87.0% of fast walkers vs. 85.5% of slow walkers). The cumulative 3-year incidence of death was significantly lower among fast walkers than slow walkers (10.9% vs. 31.7%; P<0.001). After adjusting for confounders, slow walkers had a significantly higher risk of all-cause mortality than fast walkers (hazard ratio 2.36; 95% confidence interval 1.55-3.58; P<0.001). Stratified analysis by initial treatment strategy revealed that the cumulative 3-year incidence of all-cause death was consistently lower among fast walkers than slow walkers (initial AVR strategy: 10.1% vs. 28.1% [P<0.001]; conservative strategy: 13.4% vs. 46.7% [P<0.001]). Among asymptomatic patients managed conservatively, fast walkers demonstrated a remarkably low cumulative 3-year incidence of all-cause death (8.1%).
CONCLUSIONS: The 6MWD is a reliable prognostic marker for patients with severe AS, regardless of initial treatment strategy.","['Norio Kanamori', 'Yasuaki Takeji', 'Tomohiko Taniguchi', 'Takeshi Morimoto', 'Shinichi Shirai', 'Kenji Ando', 'Hiroyuki Tabata', 'Takeshi Kitai', 'Nobuhisa Ohno', 'Ryosuke Murai', 'Kohei Osakada', 'Koichiro Murata', 'Masanao Nakai', 'Hiroshi Tsuneyoshi', 'Tomohisa Tada', 'Masashi Amano', 'Shin Watanabe', 'Hiroki Shiomi', 'Hirotoshi Watanabe', 'Yusuke Yoshikawa', 'Ryusuke Nishikawa', 'Yuki Obayashi', 'Ko Yamamoto', 'Mamoru Toyofuku', 'Shojiro Tatsushima', 'Makoto Miyake', 'Hiroyuki Nakayama', 'Kazuya Nagao', 'Masayasu Izuhara', 'Kenji Nakatsuma', 'Moriaki Inoko', 'Takanari Fujita', 'Masahiro Kimura', 'Mitsuru Ishii', 'Shunsuke Usami', 'Fumiko Nakazeki', 'Kiyonori Togi', 'Yasutaka Inuzuka', 'Tatsuhiko Komiya', 'Koh Ono', 'Takeshi Aoyama', 'Kenji Minatoya', 'Takeshi Kimura']",Circulation journal : official journal of the Japanese Circulation Society,2025-05-21,10.1253/circj.CJ-25-0056,https://doi.org/10.1253/circj.CJ-25-0056,,Paid,Prognostic Value of the 6 Minute Walk Test in Patients With Severe Aortic Stenosis KANAMORI 2025,Not available,"['Severe Aortic Stenosis', 'Aortic Stenosis', 'Walk Test', 'Severe Aortic', 'fast walkers', 'walkers', 'Patients With Severe', 'slow walkers', 'Patients', 'Severe']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['6-Minute walk test', 'Aortic stenosis', 'Aortic valve replacement', 'Prognosis']"
40398959,Survival and cause of death after isolated primary aortic valve replacement at Oslo University Hospital (2012-2021): a retrospective registry-based study.,"BACKGROUND: The treatment of aortic valve disease has changed following the introduction of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Hence, the selection of patients for surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR) is changing. Thus, we aimed to study survival and causes of death following surgical AVR at a large Scandinavian Centre in the period 2012-21.
METHODS: Information about the surgical procedure, survival and cause of death was obtained from the National Norwegian Health Registries. The latest clinical information about the deceased patients was made available from the local hospitals and examined to evaluate the causes of death from The Norwegian Cause of Death Registry.
RESULTS: From 2012 to 2021, the number of surgical implantations of aortic valve bioprostheses (AVR(b)) and patient age at the time of surgery decreased. Outcomes were excellent, with 30-day survival of 98.6% following AVR(b) and 99.8% following AVR(m). 1-year survival after AVR(b) improved from 96.4% in the first half to 98.4% in the second half of the study period, probably due to a reduction of operative risk during the study period. Non-cardiovascular mortality was the most frequent cause of death, followed by cancer, cardiovascular and valve-related death. Deaths due to cerebral bleeding or stroke were the least frequent with 10-year estimators of 1.3% and 1.6% following AVR(m) and AVR(b), respectively. The inter-rater reliability between The Norwegian Cause of Death Registry and the journal information provided was moderate, with an unweighted Cohen's kappa of 0.56 (0.47-0.64).
CONCLUSIONS: Valve-related death and death from cerebral bleeding or stroke was rare after surgical AVR. Survival was high and improved during the study period. Surgical AVR may be performed safely in low-risk patients.","['Johannes Lagethon Bjørnstad', 'Sandra Stedje Waagan', 'Tiril Karina Tegnander', 'Anne Madsi Ottestad']",Open heart,2025-05-21,10.1136/openhrt-2025-003312,https://doi.org/10.1136/openhrt-2025-003312,PMC12096966,Free,Survival and cause of death after isolated primary aortic valve replacement at Oslo University Hospital 2012 2021 a retrospective registry based study BJØRNSTAD 2025,pdfs\Survival and cause of death after isolated primary aortic valve replacement at Oslo University Hospital 2012 2021 a retrospective registry b.pdf,"['Oslo University Hospital', 'AVR', 'surgical AVR', 'aortic valve replacement', 'aortic valve', 'death', 'Death Registry', 'surgical aortic valve', 'Oslo University', 'University Hospital']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['Heart Valve Diseases', 'Heart Valve Prosthesis', 'Heart Valve Prosthesis Implantation', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care']"
40397427,Hemodynamic Impact of Cipepofol vs Propofol During Anesthesia Induction in Patients With Severe Aortic Stenosis: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"IMPORTANCE: Postinduction hemodynamic instability is a frequent complication among patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS). Using cipepofol as the anesthesia agent may reduce the incidence and severity of hemodynamic instability.
OBJECTIVE: To assess whether cipepofol outperforms propofol in maintaining postinduction hemodynamic stability in patients with AS.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This single-center, randomized clinical trial was conducted from June 29, 2023, to July 8, 2024, at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine in China. Patients with AS scheduled for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) were eligible for inclusion.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either cipepofol or propofol as anesthesia induction agents at equipotent doses.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the area under the curve (AUC) of the mean arterial pressure (MAP) difference from baseline during the initial 15 minutes postinduction.
RESULTS: A total of 124 patients with AS scheduled for TAVR were randomized into either the cipepofol group (n = 62) or the propofol group (n = 62). Of 124 patients randomized, 1 patient from each group was excluded due to ineligibility for the TAVR procedure, and data were analyzed for 122 patients (61 patients per group) based on the intention-to-treat principle. Among 122 total patients, mean (SD) age was 72.2 (5.0) years, and 53 patients (43.4%) were female. The cipepofol group exhibited a significantly smaller median (IQR) AUC (-8505.0 mm Hg · s [-12 402.8 to -5130.0]) compared with the propofol group (-13 189.0 mm Hg · s [-17 006.7 to -7593.3]; P < .001). Moreover, compared with the propofol group, the cipepofol group demonstrated a significantly lower incidence of postinduction hypotension (70.5% vs 88.5%; P = .01) and required a smaller median (IQR) dose of norepinephrine during the first 15 minutes postinduction (6.0 μg [0.0-10.0] vs 10.0 μg [5.0-20.0]; P = .006). Additionally, the 2 groups' bispectral indices were comparable.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, cipepofol provided superior hemodynamic stability as an induction agent compared to propofol at equipotent doses and similar anesthesia depths for patients with AS. Therefore, cipepofol could serve as an alternative induction agent to propofol for patients at high cardiovascular risk.

40396898,Continued Versus Interrupted Oral Anticoagulation During Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation: A Meta-Analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: A substantial number of patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) require long-term oral anticoagulants (OAC) owing to comorbidities. This study examined whether continuing oral anticoagulation periprocedurally during TAVR is as safe and effective as interrupting it.
METHODS: A systematic search of the major databases was performed to identify relevant studies. Effect estimates were calculated using risk ratios (RR) and 95% CIs by pooling the data using the inverse-variance random effects model. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.
RESULTS: Four studies were included, with 2962 patients undergoing TAVR with continued OAC (n = 1318) and interrupted OAC (n = 1644). The pooled analysis demonstrated that TAVR with continued OAC had comparable risks for all-cause mortality (RR: 0.91; 95% CI, 0.62-1.34; P = 0.64), cardiovascular mortality (RR: 0.89; 95% CI, 0.43-1.84; P = 0.76), stroke (RR: 0.67; 95% CI, 0.42-1.08; P = 0.09), closure device failure (RR: 0.86; 95% CI, 0.47-1.59; P = 0.64), major/life-threatening bleeding (RR: 0.93; 95% CI, 0.74-1.15; P = 0.49), and major vascular complications (RR: 0.97; 95% CI, 0.79-1.20; P = 0.80) compared with TAVR with interrupted OAC.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing TAVR, continued OAC showed comparable safety and efficacy with interrupted OAC. These findings demonstrate that continuing OAC in the periprocedural period may be a viable option in patients with atrial fibrillation because of comorbidities requiring anticoagulants.","['Hritvik Jain', 'Nandan Patel', 'Muhammad Daoud Tariq', 'Ali Saad Al-Shammari', 'Rozi Khan', 'Jyoti Jain', 'Rahul Patel', 'Faizan Ahmed', 'Raheel Ahmed', 'Thomas Alexander']",American journal of therapeutics,2025-05-21,10.1097/MJT.0000000000001979,https://doi.org/10.1097/MJT.0000000000001979,,Paid,Continued Versus Interrupted Oral Anticoagulation During Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation A Meta Analysis JAIN 2025,Not available,"['Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Versus Interrupted Oral', 'Aortic Valve', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'Valve Replacement', 'undergoing transcatheter aortic', 'Continued Versus Interrupted', 'Versus Interrupted', 'Oral Anticoagulation']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['TAVR', 'anticoagulation', 'aortic stenosis', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"
40396229,Feasibility of Computed Tomography as a Gatekeeper for Invasive Angiography Before TAVR: A Pragmatic Real-World Experience.,"BACKGROUND: Although pretranscatheter aortic valve replacement-computed tomography angiography (TAVR-CTA) has shown a good correlation with invasive coronary angiography (ICA) for ruling out obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD), its clinical effectiveness and safety as a gatekeeper for ICA pre-transcatheter aortic valve replacement (pre-TAVR) remain unclear. This study aims to determine whether routine TAVR-CTA, without premedication, could safely defer and guide the need for ICA pre-TAVR.
METHODS: Patients who underwent TAVR evaluation with either TAVR-CTA or ICA to determine CAD between 2017 and 2022 were included. Patients with prior coronary artery bypass grafts were excluded, and the remaining patients were divided into CAD screening with TAVR-CTA or ICA groups. The primary outcome was symptom-driven revascularization at 1 year post-TAVR.
RESULTS: Among 1165 patients (median age, 81 years; 46% women), 464 were in TAVR-CTA group and 701 were in the ICA group. Prevalence of CAD was similar (37% versus 41%; P=0.2). A total of 53% of patients were exempted from ICA after TAVR-CTA, given the absence of proximal obstructive CAD, whereas 17% had inconclusive TAVR-CTA interpretation, 15% desired for ICA despite CAD exclusion by TAVR-CTA, and 14% had obstructive CAD requiring further ICA. Elevated coronary artery calcium score and the presence of stents were associated with need for ICA after TAVR-CTA. TAVR-CTA revealed a per-patient sensitivity of 89%, specificity of 75%, positive predictive value of 69%, and negative predictive value of 91% for identifying obstructive CAD. Importantly, symptom-driven revascularization, acute coronary syndrome, and unplanned ICA at 1 year after TAVR were all low and not different between TAVR-CTA versus ICA (0.8% versus 1.8%, P=0.158; 1.6% versus 1.7%, P=0.846; 2.7% versus 2.8%, P=0.767; respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: In comparison with routine ICA pre-TAVR, integration of TAVR-CTA in our program resulted in up to 53% of patients exempted from ICA, while maintaining patient safety. This approach could have important clinical implications to improve patient access, experience, value, and throughput.","['Asa Phichaphop', 'Paul Sorajja', 'Maurice Enriquez-Sarano', 'Miho Fukui', 'Atsushi Okada', 'Davide Margonato', 'Mohammed Abed', 'Takahiro Nishihara', 'Hideki Koike', 'Evan Walser-Kuntz', 'John R Lesser', 'Victor Y Cheng', 'Vinayak N Bapat', 'Nadira Hamid', 'João L Cavalcante']",Circulation.

We report a case of complete iliac artery disruption during TAVR. A combination of a covered stent and artificial blood vessel repair was employed to achieve revascularization of the iliac artery. In this case, the patient was placed on bed rest for 10 days to avoid stent dislodgement due to early movement and was discharged from the hospital 13 days later. After that, the patient stayed away from significant lower limb activity for 3 months after surgery and underwent enhanced follow-up. Regular follow-up indicated that the patient recovered well, with no significant discomfort in the right lower limb and consistent pulse in the dorsal foot artery on both sides. The treatment of such complications typically involves surgical intervention, while this method shows a new viable option for managing such VCs. By using this method, blood flow can be blocked more quickly than through surgery, which reduced the risk of massive bleeding, death, and limb loss and improved the prognosis.","['Wensheng Zhu', 'Hanqing Deng', 'Weiqing Hu', 'Shixun Wang']",Clinical case reports,2025-05-27,10.1002/ccr3.70523,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccr3.70523,PMC12090355,Free,A Case of Treatment With a Combination of Covered Stents and Artificial Blood Vessel for Iliac Artery Rupture During Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement ZHU 2025,pdfs\A Case of Treatment With a Combination of Covered Stents and Artificial Blood Vessel for Iliac Artery Rupture During Transcatheter Aortic Va.pdf,"['Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Aortic Valve', 'Valve Replacement', 'Clinical Case Reports', 'Iliac Artery Rupture', 'Iliac Artery', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'Artificial Blood Vessel', 'Artery']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['aortic stenosis', 'artery reconstruction', 'iliac artery rupture', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement', 'vascular complication']"
40394980,Valve-in-Valve TAVR for Degenerated Surgical Valves in Patients With Small Aortic Annuli: A Report From a Japanese Nationwide Registry.,"BACKGROUND: Valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve replacement (ViV-TAVR) provides an alternative treatment for high-risk patients with failed surgical bioprosthetic aortic valves. However, limited data exist on ViV-TAVR outcomes in patients with small aortic annuli, particularly among the relatively small-statured Japanese population.
METHODS: We analyzed data from the J-TVT (Japan Transcatheter Valve Therapy) registry, which included all TAVR institutions across Japan, with data collected from July 2018, when ViV-TAVR was approved, through December 2022. A small aortic annulus was defined as an aortic annulus area of ≤314 mm², measured using preoperative computed tomography for ViV-TAVR. Prosthesis-patient mismatch (PPM) was defined as an indexed effective orifice area <0.85 cm²/m², assessed using echocardiography within 30 days after ViV-TAVR. The composite endpoint was evaluated at 30 days and 1 year.
RESULTS: Among 47 800 individuals, 1029 underwent ViV-TAVR, resulting in a final sample of 405 patients. The mean indexed effective orifice area was 0.83 cm²/m² in the small annulus group (n=225) and 0.94 cm²/m² in the nonsmall group (n=180), with PPM rates of 59.2% and 44.4%, respectively. Small annuli were independently associated with PPM (hazard ratio, 1.9 [95% CI, 1.26-2.87]; P=0.002). No differences in 30-day and 1-year outcomes were observed between groups. Among the 225 patients with small annuli, the mean indexed effective orifice area was 0.76 cm2/m2 in the balloon-expandable valve group (n=61) and 0.86 cm2/m2 in the supraannular self-expanding valve group (n=164), with PPM rates of 67.2% and 56.1%, respectively. No differences in outcomes were noted based on the type of valve implanted.
CONCLUSIONS: ViV-TAVR for small aortic annuli in Japanese patients was associated with an increased risk of PPM; however, no differences in clinical outcomes were observed according to aortic annulus size or valve type.

40393868,Anxiety during transcatheter aortic valve replacement under local anesthesia - the ART-VR trial.,"BACKGROUND: The use of local anesthesia during transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) could result in patient discomfort. Application of immersive virtual reality (VR) during TAVR might distract the patient and enhance the overall experience.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of an immersive VR environment on periprocedural anxiety and patient discomfort, compared to standard of care in patients undergoing transfemoral (TF) TAVR under local anesthesia.
METHODS: In this single-center, randomized controlled pilot study, patients were randomized to either VR immersion during TAVR or standard of care. The intervention was a VR headset to create 3D experiences during percutaneous transfemoral TAVR. The main outcome was patient-reported procedural anxiety assessed directly after the procedure on a visual analog scale (VAS). Secondary outcomes were procedural satisfaction, pain, and change in anxiety. Personality scores were obtained at baseline to explore associations between personality types and relevant outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 75 patients (VR = 37, control = 38) were included between September 2021 and January 2023. The median age was 79 (25th-75th: 75-84) years and 32 patients (43 %) were female. Overall procedural anxiety VAS was 1.0 (0.0-3.0) and satisfaction was 9.0 (8.0-10.0). There was no difference in procedural anxiety between VR and control (VAS: 1.0 [25th-75th: 0.0-3.0] versus 1.0 [25th-75th: 0.0-3.0], p = 0.59). Procedural satisfaction, pain perception and change in anxiety were not affected by VR use.
CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing TF-TAVR under local anesthesia experienced mild procedural anxiety and high satisfaction levels. Procedural VR use did not affect procedural anxiety or pain perception.","['Sraman Chatterjee', 'Joris Ooms', 'Marjo de Ronde', 'Stefan van Gorsel', 'Antonio Maarten Mattace-Raso', 'Jeannette Goudzwaard', 'Francesco Mattace-Raso', 'Isabella Kardys', 'Rutger-Jan Nuis', 'Joost Daemen', 'Nicolas Van Mieghem']",Cardiovascular revascularization medicine : including molecular interventions,2025-05-15,10.1016/j.carrev.2025.05.015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.carrev.2025.05.015,,Paid,Anxiety during transcatheter aortic valve replacement under local anesthesia the ART VR trial CHATTERJEE 2025,Not available,"['transcatheter aortic valve', 'aortic valve replacement', 'local anesthesia', 'transcatheter aortic', 'aortic valve', 'TAVR', 'valve replacement', 'Anxiety', 'ART-VR trial', 'procedural']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['Anesthesia', 'Anxiety', 'Pain', 'TAVR', 'VR']"
40393632,REdo transcatheter aortic VALVE implantation for the management of transcatheter aortic valve failure: Design and rationale of the REVALVE study.,"BACKGROUND: The expansion of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) into younger and lower risk patients increases the likelihood of future reintervention on the valve due to bioprosthetic valve failure (BVF). However, little is known about the feasibility and outcomes of redo TAVI for BVF.
METHODS: REVALVE is an investigator-initiated, open-label, prospective registry, enrolling 300 patients undergoing redo TAVI in approximately 75 centres in 11 countries in Europe and the Middle East. The primary endpoint is REVALVE success at 30-days, adapted from the Valve Academic Research Consortium-3 (VARC-3) criteria and defined as the correct positioning of a single prosthetic heart valve into the proper anatomic location, intended performance of the valve (mean gradient <20 mmHg, peak velocity < 3.0 m/s, doppler velocity index ≥0.25, <moderate aortic regurgitation), and freedom from mortality, coronary obstruction, unplanned coronary revascularisation, and surgery or intervention related to the device. The co-primary endpoint is a composite of freedom from mortality, stroke, and re-hospitalisation for valve or procedure-related causes at 1 year. Clinical and echocardiographic follow-up will continue to 5 years. Parallel cohorts will include patients presenting with TAV BVF who are managed by surgical explantation and aortic valve replacement (AVR), or by optimal medical therapy. Sub-studies will investigate computer-simulated modelling prior to redo TAVI, post-implant coronary catheterisation, and post-procedure multi-slice computed tomography.
CONCLUSIONS: The REVALVE study is a prospective multi-centre study investigating the management of TAV failure by redo TAVI, with parallel cohorts treated by surgical AVR and optimal medical therapy.

40392421,When surgery is not an option: case report of transcatheter valve-in-valve replacement for mitral valve dysfunction.,"BACKGROUND: Heart valve diseases affect over 100 million people globally, with mitral regurgitation being the most common in developed countries. Bioprosthetic heart valves, frequently used for replacement, typically last 10-15 years before degeneration. Repeat open-heart surgery for valve replacement poses high risks, especially in older or high-risk patients. Following the success of transcatheter aortic valve replacement, transcatheter mitral valve-in-valve replacement has emerged as a less invasive alternative for patients deemed inoperable due to high surgical risks.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 69-year-old male with a history of mitral bioprosthetic valve replacement and thoracic radiotherapy who presented with shortness of breath and NYHA class 3 functional capacity. Echocardiography revealed bioprosthetic valve dysfunction with a mean gradient of 13 mmHg and pulmonary artery pressure of 70 mmHg. Given his high surgical risk (The Society of Thoracic Surgeons score 10.9%, EuroScore2 9.8%) and prior thoracic radiotherapy, a transcatheter valve-in-valve procedure was planned. A 29 mm MyVal valve was successfully implanted via a transseptal approach, resulting in complete resolution of mitral regurgitation and a mean gradient of 3 mmHg post-procedure. The patient was discharged without complications and reported improved functional capacity (NYHA class 1) at follow-up.
CONCLUSION: This case highlights the successful application of transcatheter valve-in-valve replacement for a patient with bioprosthetic mitral valve dysfunction who was at high surgical risk. The procedure, performed using a transseptal approach with a 29 mm MyVal valve, resulted in significant symptomatic and hemodynamic improvement with no complications. The patient's functional capacity improved dramatically, and follow-up imaging confirmed the effective functioning of the new valve. This case supports the viability of transcatheter techniques as a preferred alternative for inoperable patients with mitral valve dysfunction, contributing valuable insights to the growing field of minimally invasive cardiac interventions. As technology advances, transcatheter solutions are expected to offer safer and more effective treatments for bioprosthetic valve failures.","['Yakup Alsancak', 'Hasan Kan', 'Ahmet Seyfettin Gürbüz', 'Nergiz Aydın', 'Muhammed Fatih Kaleli']",The Egyptian heart journal : (EHJ) : official bulletin of the Egyptian Society of Cardiology,2025-05-20,10.1186/s43044-025-00646-y,https://doi.org/10.1186/s43044-025-00646-y,PMC12092925,Free,When surgery is not an option case report of transcatheter valve in valve replacement for mitral valve dysfunction ALSANCAK 2025,pdfs\When surgery is not an option case report of transcatheter valve in valve replacement for mitral valve dysfunction ALSANCAK 2025.pdf,"['valve', 'mitral valve', 'mitral valve dysfunction', 'valve replacement', 'bioprosthetic valve', 'mitral', 'mitral bioprosthetic valve', 'valve dysfunction', 'bioprosthetic valve replacement', 'bioprosthetic valve dysfunction']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['Bioprosthetic valve dysfunction', 'Thoracic radiotherapy', 'Transcatheter mitral valve replacement', 'Transseptal approach', 'Valve-in-valve']"
40391859,Impact of Periprocedural Statin Therapy on Mortality and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: A Meta-Analysis and Meta-Regression.,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) stands as a notable alternative to surgical valve replacement for severe aortic stenosis (AS). Despite the established benefits of statins in cardiovascular pathologies, their specific impact in patients with severe AS undergoing TAVR remains uncertain.
AIMS: Our meta-analysis aims to assess whether periprocedural statin therapy improves survival and outcomes post-TAVR, thus addressing this gap in literature.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search using various databases with relevant keywords terms was conducted to identify studies on the impact of periprocedural statin therapy on TAVR outcomes. We assessed the primary outcome of all-cause mortality alongside various secondary outcomes including stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA), myocardial infarction, acute kidney injury (AKI), 30-day mortality, in-hospital mortality, rehospitalization, cardiovascular complications, and pacemaker requirement. A random-effects model using Comprehensive Meta Analysis Software was employed to analyze the data for each outcome. Statistical significance was set at a p < 0.05.
RESULTS: Our analysis of 19 observational studies revealed that periprocedural statin therapy significantly reduces all-cause mortality following TAVR surgery (OR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.61-0.83, p < 0.001). However, the influence of statins on other outcomes remains inconclusive. These outcomes include stroke/TIA (OR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.68-1.19, p = 0.455), risk of MI (OR = 1.72, 95% CI: 0.73-4.04, p = 0.214), AKI (OR = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.75-1.31, p = 0.968), 30-day mortality (OR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.46-1.10, p = 0.126), in-hospital mortality (OR = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.13-1.38, p = 0.151), rehospitalization (OR = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.66-1.29, p = 0.645), cardiovascular complications (OR = 1.12, 95% CI: 0.91-1.37, p = 0.297), and pacemaker requirement (OR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.65-1.06, p = 0.133).
CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis indicates a potentially promising role for periprocedural statin therapy in enhancing patient outcomes post-TAVR surgery. We found a notable association between statin therapy and a reduction in all-cause mortality. However, the effects on secondary outcomes did not reach statistical significance, which warrants further investigation through larger, well-designed, randomized controlled trials.","['Aman Goyal', 'Surabhi Maheshwari', 'Yusra Mashkoor', 'Ajeet Singh', 'Faryal Rafique', 'Abu Baker Sheikh', 'Kamna Bansal']",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,2025-05-20,10.1002/ccd.31607,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.31607,,Paid,Impact of Periprocedural Statin Therapy on Mortality and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement A Meta Analysis and Meta Regression GOYAL 2025,Not available,"['Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Valve Replacement', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'Periprocedural Statin Therapy', 'Aortic Valve', 'surgical valve replacement', 'Statin Therapy', 'Periprocedural Statin', 'Statin']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['TAVI', 'TAVR', 'cardiology', 'complications', 'meta‐analysis', 'mortality', 'statins', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"

40388768,Heyde syndrome: Experiences with the use of semiautomatic vWF multimer analysis for diagnosis and TAVI for treatment - case report.,"RATIONALE: Aortic stenosis (AS) is currently the most frequent valve disorder. In addition, the angiodysplasias are the most common vascular malformations of the gastrointestinal tract. Heyde syndrome (HS) is a rare disease which links these 2 pathological conditions.
PATIENT CONCERNS: Currently, there are no clearly defined guidelines for the confirmation of HS diagnosis and for timing of aortic valve replacement in patients with confirmed HS, despite the fact that HS is connected with increased mortality and the need for numerous rehospitalizations and multiple blood transfusions. Therefore, the aim of this study was to report (our) first experiences with novel diagnostic method for acquired von Willebrand (vW) syndrome and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for treatment of HS.
DIAGNOSES: We report a case of a 68-year-old man who was diagnosed with HS with the use of semiautomatic vW factor multimer analysis.
INTERVENTIONS: A successful TAVR was used for treatment of AS.
OUTCOMES: After the interventional treatment of AS, the patient did not have a recurrence of the anemic syndrome.
LESSONS: This is a unique case of a patient with HS in whom semiautomatic vW factor multimer analysis was used for diagnosis of acquired vW syndrome together with TAVR procedure for HS treatment.","['Boris Focko', 'Zuzana Miertová', 'Ingrid Škorňová', 'Martin Hudec', 'Martin Jozef Péč', 'Jakub Jurica', 'Marek Cingel', 'Tomáš Bolek', 'Juraj Sokol', 'Petra Poliačiková', 'Marián Mokáň', 'Matej Samoš']",Medicine,2025-05-16,10.1097/MD.0000000000042486,https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000042486,PMC12091634,Free,Heyde syndrome Experiences with the use of semiautomatic vWF multimer analysis for diagnosis and TAVI for treatment case report FOCKO 2025,pdfs\Heyde syndrome Experiences with the use of semiautomatic vWF multimer analysis for diagnosis and TAVI for treatment case report FOCKO 2025.p.pdf,"['acquired von Willebrand', 'aortic valve', 'aortic valve replacement', 'von Willebrand syndrome', 'von Willebrand', 'multimer analysis', 'vWF multimer analysis', 'University Hospital Martin', 'factor multimer analysis', 'transcatheter aortic valve']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['Heyde syndrome', 'acquired von Willebrand syndrome', 'aortic stenosis', 'semiautomatic von Willebrand factor multimer analysis']"
40388090,Advances in Clinical Cardiology 2024: A Summary of Key Clinical Trials.,"INTRODUCTION: In 2024, numerous key clinical trials in the field of clinical cardiology have been published or presented at major international conferences. This review seeks to collate and summarise these trials and reflect on their clinical context.
METHODS: The authors evaluated all clinical trials presented at major cardiology conferences during 2024 with a focus on clinical trials which would influence and/or change current clinical practice. We reviewed clinical trials presented at all major international conferences including the American College of Cardiology (ACC), European Association for Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions (EuroPCR), European Society of Cardiology (ESC), Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics (TCT), American Heart Association (AHA), European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA), Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI), TVT-The Heart Summit (TVT) and Cardiovascular Research Technologies (CRT). Trials considered to have highest impact and/or broad relevance across the field of clinical cardiology, with a high likelihood to change or impact upon clinical practice were included.
RESULTS: Over 90 key cardiology clinical trials were identified across the spectrum of clinical cardiology. Important updates in percutaneous coronary intervention were reviewed including new ESC guidance and several key trials in the field of coronary physiology (FAVOR III), drug-coated balloons (REGCAGE-FREE, AGENT-IDE), shock, and acute coronary syndromes (SENIOR-RITA, DanGer-Shock). Structural trials included major updates in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) from EARLY-TAVR, TAVR-UNLOAD and NOTION 3, as well as seminal trials in tricuspid (TRISCEND II) and mitral intervention (MATTERHORN). Key updates in preventative cardiology included new data in lipoprotein (a) pharmacotherapy, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol reduction and hypertension management (BPROAD, BedMed, KRAKEN), as well as several key trials in heart failure (SUMMIT, FINEARTS) hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (SEQUOIA-HCM) and cardiac amyloid (HELIOS-B).

40387044,Totally endoscopic aortic valve replacement after open surgical and subsequent transcatheter aortic valve replacement.,"Transcatheter aortic valve replacement is increasingly being offered to younger and lower risk patients, including patients with previous surgical aortic valve replacement. The long-term outcome of valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve replacement after surgical valve replacement remains uncertain. We present the case of a fully thoracoscopic redo aortic valve replacement for symptomatic valve-in-valve stenosis after previous open surgical aortic valve replacement and secondary valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve replacement. This procedure has proven to be difficult and high risk, in part due to the redo nature of the operation and the extensive neo- endothelialization over the transcatheter aortic valve replacement stent frame.

40384343,Continuation Versus Interruption of Oral Anticoagulation During TAVI: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Oral Anticoagulation Management in TAVI.,"Patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) often require long-term oral anticoagulation (OAC), but it is unclear whether to continue or interrupt OAC during the procedure. This meta-analysis compares clinical outcomes of continuing versus interrupting OAC during TAVI. PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central databases were searched from inception to September 2024 for studies comparing continuation versus interruption of OAC in patients undergoing TAVI with an indication for OAC, including vitamin K antagonists and direct oral anticoagulants. Risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were pooled using a random-effects model. Sensitivity analysis was performed using the Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman method. Three studies were included, one randomized controlled trial and two cohort studies, with 2773 patients, of whom 1314 (47.4%) continued OAC during TAVI. At a 30-day follow-up after TAVI, there were no significant differences between groups in all-cause mortality (RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.45-1.20; p = 0.22), any bleeding (RR 1.08; 95% CI 0.81-1.43; p = 0.60), and major bleeding (RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.67-1.21; p = 0.48). However, the continued OAC group was associated with a lower stroke rate (RR 0.65; 95% CI 0.42-1.01; p = 0.053), also attested after a sensitivity analysis (RR 0.65; 95% CI 0.47-0.90; p < 0.03). In patients with an indication for OAC undergoing TAVI, uninterrupted anticoagulation is associated with similar thrombotic and hemorrhagic outcomes compared to interrupted OAC. Stroke risk was lower in the continued OAC group, with a significant reduction, as demonstrated in sensitivity analysis.","['Jefferson Manoel Borges Martins', 'Rafael Dos Santos Borges', 'Giovanni Gosch Berton', 'Paula Larissa Ferreira Vieira', 'Pedro Antônio Machado Gomes de Sousa', 'Ana Livia Chaves Vieira', 'Christian Ken Fukunaga', 'Vanessa Karlinski Vizentin', 'Esthefani Monique Rodrigues Macedo', 'Camila Mota Guida']",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,2025-05-19,10.1002/ccd.31599,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.31599,,Paid,Continuation Versus Interruption of Oral Anticoagulation During TAVI A Systematic Review and Meta Analysis Oral Anticoagulation Management in TAVI MARTINS 2025,Not available,"['Oral Anticoagulation Management', 'Systematic Review', 'Oral Anticoagulation', 'Anticoagulation Management', 'Meta-Analysis Oral Anticoagulation', 'Continuation Versus Interruption', 'OAC', 'TAVI', 'long-term oral anticoagulation', 'OAC undergoing TAVI']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['direct oral anticoagulants', 'perioperative care', 'stroke', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement', 'treatment interruption', 'vitamin K antagonists']"
40383183,The safety and feasibility of same day discharge for patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Next day discharge (NDD) after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has been shown to be safe in appropriately selected patients and has since been implemented into clinical practice. As the demand for TAVR grows, improving its accessibility is crucial. Several studies have trialled same day discharge (SDD) after TAVR, but a review has not been performed.
METHODS: Five databases were searched. Baseline demographics, study characteristics and the assessment criteria used to determine eligibility for SDD were extracted and compared. Proportional meta-analysis was used to compare post-TAVI outcomes between SDD and NDD patients.
RESULTS: Six studies were included from 1734 screened articles. Of 3519 patients, 318 (9.0%) underwent SDD (mean age 78.2 ± 8.7 years; 59.3% male). Balloon-expanding valves were used in 91.6% of cases, and self-expanding valves in the remaining 8.4%. Patients that underwent SDD experienced lower rates of mortality (OR 0.104, 95% CI: 0.015 - 0.998), all-cause readmission (OR 0.194, 95% CI 0.052 - 0.717), cardiovascular readmissions (OR 0.155, 95% CI 0.026 - 0.971), and new pacemaker requirement (OR 0.167, 95% 0.028 - 0.995) at 30 days after TAVR, compared to patients that underwent NDD. There was no difference in rates of stroke (OR 0.407, 95% CI: 0.015 - 16.694) or major vascular complications (0.0% vs 0.0%).
CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence supports the safety and feasibility of SDD after elective, transfemoral TAVR in appropriately selected patients. Heterogeneity between eligibility criteria used to select patients for SDD, especially related to conduction disease, poses a barrier to implementation. Further research on self-expanding valves is needed.","['Princess Neila Litkouhi', 'Karan Rao', 'Alexandra Baer', 'Peter S Hansen', 'Ravinay Bhindi']",The Canadian journal of cardiology,2025-05-16,10.1016/j.cjca.2025.05.007,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2025.05.007,,Paid,The safety and feasibility of same day discharge for patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement a systematic review and meta analysis LITKOUHI 2025,Not available,"['aortic valve replacement', 'undergoing transcatheter aortic', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'transcatheter aortic', 'day discharge', 'SDD', 'TAVR', 'patients undergoing transcatheter', 'valve replacement', 'patients']",2025-05-27,Pending,[]
40382742,Transcatheter Versus Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement in Patients with Polyvascular Disease.,"INTRODUCTION: There is a paucity of data regarding the trends and comparative outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) versus surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) among patients with polyvascular disease (PVD).
METHODS: The Nationwide Readmissions Database (2016-2020) was queried for patients undergoing AVR. Propensity score matching was used to compare the outcomes of TAVR versus SAVR among patients with PVD, and for comparing TAVR among those with versus without PVD. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality.
RESULTS: The final cohort included 545,409 hospitalizations for AVR. During the study years, there was an increase in the utilization of TAVR versus SAVR among patients with PVD. Patients with PVD undergoing TAVR were older and more likely to be women compared with patients with PVD undergoing SAVR. Compared with SAVR, patients with PVD undergoing TAVR had lower odds of in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.26; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19-0.35), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, and major bleeding, but higher odds of pacemaker and non-elective 90-day readmissions (aOR 1.13; 95% CI 1.01-1.26). TAVR among patients with versus without PVD showed similar in-hospital mortality (aOR 1.10; 95% CI 0.94-1.20), while there were higher odds of AMI, ischemic stroke, and vascular complications after TAVR in patients with PVD. A higher burden of atherosclerotic vascular beds conferred higher mortality with SAVR more than with TAVR, while a higher burden of atherosclerotic vascular beds conferred a higher risk of ischemic stroke and readmissions after both TAVR and SAVR.
CONCLUSIONS: Nationwide data demonstrated that patients with PVD who undergo TAVR were associated with lower in-hospital mortality and major cardiovascular complications compared with those who undergo SAVR. Patients with PVD have similar mortality to those with no PVD undergoing TAVR, but were associated with a higher risk for complications and readmission.
The Nationwide Readmissions Database (2016–2020) was queried for patients undergoing aortic valve replacement AVR (n = 545,409). There was an increase in the utilization of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in favor of surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) among patients with polyvascular disease. Patients with polyvascular disease undergoing TAVR had lower odds of in-hospital mortality, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, and major bleeding compared with SAVR, but higher odds of pacemaker and non-elective 90-day readmissions. TAVR among patients with versus without polyvascular disease showed similar in-hospital mortality, while there were higher odds of myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and vascular complications after TAVR in patients with polyvascular disease.

40379374,Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Severe Horizontal Heart With Acute Aortic Angulation.,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become a first-line treatment for elderly patients with severe aortic stenosis since its first successful implementation in 2002. However, performing TAVR in patients with extreme horizontal heart orientation and acute aortic angulation is technically challenging and carries higher procedural risks.
CASE SUMMARY: This case report describes a patient with severe aortic stenosis complicated by an extreme horizontal heart position and acute aortic angulation. Under the support of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), femoral artery long sheaths, and snare traction, the TAVR procedure was successfully completed.
DISCUSSION: The success of this case provides valuable insights for managing complex TAVR procedures.
TAKE-HOME MESSAGES: CPB provides critical hemodynamic support during TAVR in patients with extreme horizontal cardiac orientation, effectively preventing intraoperative circulatory collapse. Advancing a femoral artery long sheath combined with snare traction overcomes challenges when TAVR in cases of severe horizontal heart orientation and acute aortic angulation.","['Feng Liang', 'Jiaxin Zhao', 'Yiming Zhang', 'Chi Yuan', 'Bingbing Zhang', 'Jun Xie']",JACC.

40376780,Aortic Valve Calcium Score Quantification by Contrast Cardiac CT: Correlations With Echocardiography and Optimal Thresholds.,"BACKGROUND: Aortic valve calcium score (AVCa) measured on noncontrast computed tomography (CT) is well-established for grading aortic stenosis (AS) severity. However, thresholds for AVCa measured on contrast CT remain uncertain. We evaluated correlations, associated factors, and severity thresholds of AVCa measured on contrast CT against transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) measures of AS.
METHODS: Patients with native AS undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement evaluation from 2019 to 2020 who underwent TTE and contrast-enhanced CT were retrospectively studied (n=1035, age 79±9 years, 429 (41.5%) women, 906 (87.5%) severe and 129 (12.5%) moderate AS by TTE). AVCa was measured using the modified Agatston method with the minimum threshold of 4 SD above the mean ascending aorta blood pool Hounsfield units. Receiver-operating characteristics analysis and Youden index were used to define sex-specific optimal AVCa thresholds for identifying severe AS defined by TTE (aortic valve area by continuity equation ≤1.0 cm2) in the derivation cohort and assessed when applied to the validation cohort.
RESULTS: Mean aortic valve area on TTE was 0.79±0.21 cm2, while mean AVCa score, volume, and mass were 2152±1102 modified AU, 1853±1592 mm3, and 673±485 mg, respectively. Multivariable linear regression identified women to be associated with lower AVCa (β-coefficient, -358), while chronic kidney disease was associated with a higher AVCa (β-coefficient, 171). Optimal severe AS thresholds of ≥1840 modified AU for men and ≥1430 modified AU for women were determined, with area under curve (95% CIs) and sensitivities/specificities of 0.809 (0.749-0.869, 71.3%, 82.2%) for men and 0.822 (0.751-0.892), 73.4%/78.9% for women in the derivation cohort, and 0.830 (0.786-0.875), 75.9%/87.5% for men and 0.780 (0.670-0.890), 77.5%/71.4% for women in the validation cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: AVCa by contrast CT is a useful tool for identifying severe AS by TTE, with sex-specific thresholds for severe AS identified. Further studies are necessary to externally validate our findings and evaluate their prognostic significance.","['Tiffany Dong', 'Elio Haroun', 'Aro Daniela Arockiam', 'Rishabh Khurana', 'Joseph El Dahdah', 'Ankit Agrawal', 'Yuichiro Okushi', 'David Moros', 'Kashyap Bodi', 'Ushasi Saraswati', 'Mohammad Alamer', 'Abdelrahman Abushouk', 'Agam Bansal', 'Serge Harb', 'Zoran Popovic', 'Leonardo Rodriguez', 'Rishi Puri', 'Grant Reed', 'Amar Krishnaswamy', 'Brian Griffin', 'Samir Kapadia', 'Tom Kai Ming Wang']",Circulation.

40375767,Leaflet modification techniques to mitigate coronary obstruction risk during transcatheter aortic valve implantation.,"Coronary obstruction is a rare but serious complication during transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), particularly in valve-in-valve procedures, which is associated with high mortality. This review explores various leaflet modification techniques designed to mitigate this risk. Among the most studied methods is Bioprosthetic or native Aortic Scallop Intentional Laceration to prevent Iatrogenic Coronary Artery obstruction (BASILICA), which uses transcatheter electrosurgery to lacerate the aortic valve leaflet and maintain coronary perfusion. Other promising techniques include ShortCut, a mechanical leaflet splitting device, and Undermining Iatrogenic Coronary Obstruction with Radiofrequency Needle (UNICORN), which utilises radiofrequency energy to achieve leaflet laceration. These approaches differ in their procedural complexity, equipment requirements, and clinical outcomes. Each technique's efficacy in preventing coronary obstruction is discussed, alongside the potential complications and the procedural challenges encountered in both native aortic valve and valve-in-valve settings. This review also highlights the importance of careful patient selection, advanced imaging techniques, and the need for further research to optimise these strategies.","['Sunny Goel', 'Richard Tanner', 'Kwong-Yue Eric Chan', 'Jaffar M Khan', 'Manish Vinayak', 'Stamatios Lerakis', 'Lucy M Safi', 'Sahil Khera', 'Parasuram Krishnamoorthy', 'Annapoorna S Kini', 'Samin K Sharma', 'George D Dangas', 'Gilbert H L Tang']",EuroIntervention : journal of EuroPCR in collaboration with the Working Group on Interventional Cardiology of the European Society of Cardiology,2025-05-16,10.4244/EIJ-D-24-00972,https://doi.org/10.4244/EIJ-D-24-00972,PMC12063549,Paid,Leaflet modification techniques to mitigate coronary obstruction risk during transcatheter aortic valve implantation GOEL 2025,Not downloaded,"['aortic valve implantation', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'aortic valve', 'coronary obstruction', 'valve implantation', 'Aortic Scallop Intentional', 'coronary', 'aortic', 'Iatrogenic Coronary Artery', 'transcatheter aortic']",2025-05-27,Pending,[]
40375761,Long-term structural valve deterioration after TAVI: insights from the EORP ESC Valve Durability TAVI Registry.,"BACKGROUND: Valve durability is a key consideration as the patient population eligible for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) expands to include lower-risk and younger individuals who are expected to live many years after the procedure.
AIMS: This registry aimed to assess the incidence of long-term structural valve deterioration (SVD) beyond 5 years post-TAVI.
METHODS: Consecutive living patients who underwent TAVI up until 2014 using any commercially available transcatheter heart valve (THV) at 22 participant centres were enrolled in the European Valve Durability TAVI Registry. All patients underwent comprehensive echocardiographic assessments (61% were evaluated independently by a central core laboratory) within 6 months of enrolment and at least 5 years post-TAVI; SVD was defined according to Valve Academic Research Consortium 3 definitions.
RESULTS: A total of 597 patients (aged 79.6±7.1 years at the time of TAVI; 47.2% male, mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons score 5.0%) were included. At a median of 6.1 years of follow-up (interquartile range 5.2-7.3 years), the crude incidence of moderate/severe SVD was 9.5% (n=57; moderate: 6.2%, n=37; severe: 3.4%, n=20). Predictors of SVD identified by Cox regression analysis were use of an intra-annular THV (hazard ratio [HR] 38.44, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 10.8-136.3; p<0.001), a small THV size (HR 4.82, 95% CI: 2.42-9.60; p<0.001) and moderate/severe postprocedural paravalvular leak (HR 3.64, 95% CI: 1.59-8.32; p=0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of moderate/severe SVD during long-term follow-up after TAVI is low, with severe SVD being even rarer than moderate SVD.

40371620,Rationale and Design of the REPEAT Trial: A Multicenter Randomized Trial Comparing Redo Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement to Valve-in-Valve Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.,"BACKGROUND: Redo surgical aortic valve replacement (rSAVR) has for long been the therapeutic reference standard for degenerated surgical aortic bioprostheses. Valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve replacement (ViV-TAVR) has emerged as an alternative for patients at high surgical risk due to its lower invasiveness. The long-term clinical efficacy of ViV-TAVR in patients at low to intermediate surgical risk remains unknown.
METHODS AND RESULTS: To compare clinical outcomes of redo surgical aortic valve replacement versus ViV-TAVR in low- to intermediate-risk patients with degenerated surgical aortic bioprostheses. REPEAT (Repeat Intervention for Deteriorated Surgical Bioprosthetic Aortic Valves) is an investigator-initiated, international, multicenter, randomized, parallel, open-label trial. A total of 890 patients aged <75 years with a failed surgical aortic bioprosthesis due to structural valve degeneration and low to intermediate surgical risk (ie, Society of Thoracic Surgeons predicted risk of death of <8%) will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either redo surgical aortic valve replacement or ViV-TAVR. The primary end point of REPEAT is a composite of all-cause death, stroke (including both disabling and nondisabling), myocardial infarction, and rehospitalization for heart failure or aortic valve reintervention at 5 years, based on Valve Academic Research Consortium-3 definitions. Secondary end points include each of the individual components of the primary composite end point, Valve Academic Research Consortium-3-based conduction disturbances and arrhythmia, Valve Academic Research Consortium-3-based wound and bleeding complications, functional status (ie, 6-minute walk test, Kansas City Cardiomyopathy questionnaire), and treatment costs.
CONCLUSIONS: The REPEAT trial has been designed to test the hypothesis that redo surgical aortic valve replacement is superior to ViV-TAVR regarding clinical outcomes at 5 years in patients with degenerated surgical aortic bioprostheses and low to intermediate surgical risk.","['Matthias Raschpichler', 'Suzanne de Waha', 'Stefan Blankenberg', 'Marcio A Diniz', 'Emilia Bagiella', 'Annetine C Gelijns', 'Vinicius F Calsavara', 'Aakriti Gupta', 'Niklas Schofer', 'Tsuyoshi Kaneko', 'Mohamed Abdel-Wahab', 'Holger Thiele', 'Raj Makkar', 'Michael A Borger']",Journal of the American Heart Association,2025-05-20,10.1161/JAHA.125.040954,https://doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.125.040954,,Paid,Rationale and Design of the REPEAT Trial A Multicenter Randomized Trial Comparing Redo Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement to Valve in Valve Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement RASCHPICHLER 2025,Not available,"['Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Surgical Aortic Valve', 'Redo Surgical Aortic', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Aortic Valve', 'Surgical Aortic', 'Comparing Redo Surgical', 'Valve Academic Research', 'Valve Replacement', 'Trial Comparing Redo']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['aortic stenosis', 'failed surgical aortic bioprosthesis', 'redo surgical aortic valve replacement', 'structural valve deterioration', 'valve‐in‐valve transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"
40371611,Comparing Major Gastrointestinal Bleeding in Patients Receiving Edoxaban Versus Warfarin After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: Results From the Randomized ENVISAGE-TAVI AF Trial.,"BACKGROUND: Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants are recommended over vitamin K antagonists in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF). However, the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding may be higher with non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants versus vitamin K antagonists. Patients after successful transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) who are elderly and frail have worse outcomes with major gastrointestinal bleeding (MGIB), including death. This study evaluated incidence, predictors, and impact of MGIB among patients with AF after successful TAVR.
METHODS: This on-treatment analysis of ENVISAGE-TAVI AF (Edoxaban Compared to Standard Care After Heart Valve Replacement Using a Catheter in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation) included patients who received ≥1 dose of the study drug. Demographic, clinical, and procedural characteristics were compared between patients with versus without an MGIB event. Cox multivariable regression analysis identified predictors of MGIB.
RESULTS: Of 1377 patients in this analysis, 83 (6.0%) experienced MGIB, with 56 (67.5%) of these patients receiving edoxaban. Patients with versus without MGIB were more likely to have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention ≤30 days before TAVR (9.6% versus 4.2%; P=0.03), a higher ejection fraction (mean±SD, 58.0±10.4 versus 55.3±11.5; P=0.04), and carotid artery disease (13.3% versus 6.6%; P=0.04). Edoxaban without dose adjustment versus vitamin K antagonist use (P=0.003), smoking (P=0.01), low hemoglobin levels (P<0.0001), and percutaneous coronary intervention ≤30 days before TAVR (P=0.01) emerged as predictors of MGIB.
CONCLUSIONS: In this ENVISAGE-TAVI AF subanalysis, MGIB occurred in 6.0% of patients with prevalent or incident AF undergoing TAVR, and those receiving edoxaban versus vitamin K antagonists had a higher risk of MGIB. A priori identification of risk factors for MGIB may help optimize outcomes for patients with AF undergoing TAVR.

40371608,Sex-Associated Disparities in Surgical and Percutaneous Management of Aortic Stenosis With Severe Features: Retrospective Analysis From the National Readmission Database.,"BACKGROUND: Referral for valve intervention for severe aortic stenosis (AS) may exhibit sex-associated disparities independent of the growth of transcatheter interventions. This study aimed to determine whether there were sex-associated differences in the use of aortic valve replacement (AVR), either surgical or transcatheter, in patients with aortic stenosis and severe features from a national cohort of patients.
METHODS: Using the National Readmission Database, all patients with an index diagnosis of AS between January 2015 and December 2019 were included and stratified by their 90-day readmission status and sex. AS with severe features was defined as the combination of primary- or secondary-coded diagnosis of AS in combination with heart failure, syncope, angina pectoris, cardiac arrest, or cardiogenic shock. A 1:1 nested case-control matching was performed to account for competing risk. The main investigated outcome was the sex-associated rate of AVR in the 90 days after index hospitalization.
RESULTS: A total of 31 712 matched weighted discharges were included in the analysis, 16 597 men (52.3%) and 15 116 women (47.7%). At 90 days, the rate of AVR was significantly lower in women (45.7% versus 53.6%, P<0.001) with significant difference for both surgical (P<0.001) and transcatheter (P=0.010) interventions. After multivariable adjustment, these differences persisted with women significantly less likely to receive AVR (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.67 [95% CI, 0.63-0.71], P<0.001), either surgical AVR (aOR, 0.48 [95% CI, 0.43-0.54], P<0.001) or transcatheter aortic valve implantation (aOR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.75-0.84], P<0.001).

40371597,Anatomical and Functional Predictors of Permanent Pacemaker Implantation After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.,"BACKGROUND: High-degree atrioventricular block with the need for permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation represents a frequent complication after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Extension of indication for TAVI toward subjects with lower surgical risk requires reduction of the likelihood for the need for PPM implantation. The aim of the current analysis was to identify predictors of the need for PPM implantation after TAVI.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In a cohort of 1500 consecutive patients without a PPM undergoing transfemoral TAVI, clinical and procedural characteristics as well as parameters derived from cardiac computed tomography, such as membranous septal length and calcium volumes of the aortic valve cusps and the left ventricular outflow tract were assessed. Median calcium volume of the aortic valve was 552 mm3 (interquartile range [IQR]: 340-811 mm3) in the group of subjects requiring a PPM, which was higher than in the group of subjects not requiring PPM implantation (455 mm3 [IQR: 245-723 mm3], Padj=0.001). The same was true for calcification of the noncoronary cusp (Padj=0.027), left coronary cusp (Padj=0.033), and right coronary cusp (Padj=0.006). In multivariable analysis, calcium volume of the noncoronary cusp (P=0.039; odds ratio [OR], 1.089 per 100 mm3), preexisting complete right bundle-branch block (P<0.001; OR, 9.402), and implantation of a self-expandable prosthesis (P<0.001; OR, 1.856) were significantly associated with PPM implantation after TAVI.
CONCLUSIONS: The current analysis offers a detailed examination of predictors for the need for PPM implantation after TAVI.

40371590,A Two-Step Risk Score for Prediction of Permanent Pacemaker Implantation After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.,"BACKGROUND: The need for postoperative permanent pacemaker implantation (PPMI) remains one of the most frequent complications after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). This study aimed to develop a novel, 2-step risk score to predict PPMI probability after TAVI and implement it into a user-friendly website. Our risk score addresses the data gap on current prosthesis generations and provides a new, clinically motivated approach to calculating PPMI risk.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Between January 2019 and December 2020, 1039 patients underwent TAVI at our institution. We retrospectively evaluated clinical, electrocardiographic, echocardiographic, computed tomographic, and periprocedural data. Patients with prior PPMI were excluded. We developed a prediction model for PPMI occurrence, using 55 patient and procedural characteristics. With exclusion criteria applied, 836 patients (mean age 80.3±9.1 years; 50.6% female) were included. Of these, 149 (17.8%) required PPMI within 30 days after TAVI. Fourteen preprocedural parameters, including preexisting right bundle-branch block, atrioventricular block, left bundle-branch block, bradycardia, interventricular septum thickness, New York Heart Association class, and aortic annulus perimeter, were identified as PPMI risk factors and used to calculate the baseline risk in the first step of the TAVI PACER score. The second step includes intraprocedural variables to demonstrate how PPMI risk can vary based on valve type and implantation depth. The TAVI PACER score predicts PPMI with a sensitivity of 76% and specificity of 72% (area under the curve=0.8).
CONCLUSIONS: The TAVI PACER score provides a novel tool for daily clinical practice, predicting individual PPMI risk after TAVI based on various patient and procedural characteristics.","['Alexandra Janiszewski', 'Julia Lueg', 'Daniel Schulze', 'Benjamin Juri', 'Louis Morell', 'Maria Hajduczenia', 'Pierre Hennig', 'Aslihan Erbay', 'Alexander Lembcke', 'Stefan Niehues', 'Ulf Landmesser', 'Karl Stangl', 'David Leistner', 'Verena Tscholl', 'Henryk Dreger']",Journal of the American Heart Association,2025-05-20,10.1161/JAHA.124.039036,https://doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.124.039036,,Paid,A Two Step Risk Score for Prediction of Permanent Pacemaker Implantation After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation JANISZEWSKI 2025,Not available,"['Permanent Pacemaker Implantation', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Aortic Valve Implantation', 'Permanent Pacemaker', 'TAVI PACER score', 'Pacemaker Implantation', 'postoperative permanent pacemaker', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'Valve Implantation', 'PPMI']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['TAVI', 'aortic valve', 'pacemaker', 'risk score']"

However, higher post-procedural transprosthetic gradients are more common after ViV-TAVR than after TAVR for native aortic valve stenosis. We sought to evaluate the impact of type of implanted valve and balloon post-dilation on echocardiographic results and mortality in ViV-TAVR patients.
METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred and eleven consecutive patients were enrolled. A balloon-expandable valve, a self-expandable valve without balloon post-dilation, and a self-expandable valve with balloon post-dilation were performed in 35 (Group 1), 39 (Group 2), and 37 (Group 3) patients, respectively. All patients underwent comprehensive transthoracic echocardiography at baseline, discharge, and 6-12 months follow-up. Successful ViV-TAVR was performed in 110 patients (99%). Baseline transprosthetic gradients, left ventricular volumes, ejection fraction, and pulmonary artery systolic pressure were similar among groups. All groups experienced a significant reduction in post-procedural gradients at discharge and during the 6-12 months follow-up compared with baseline. At discharge, the lowest mean gradient was observed in Group 3 (12 ± 7 mmHg) compared with both Group 1 (20 ± 9 mmHg) and Group 2 (17 ± 8 mmHg, P = 0.001). This result was confirmed at 6-12 months follow-up (P = 0.012). Similar 5-year all-cause mortality was observed among groups (34%, 36%, 14%, respectively, P = 0.056).
CONCLUSION: In patients with failed surgical aortic prosthesis, ViV-TAVR is an effective treatment option associated with sustained improved haemodynamics regardless of transcatheter valve type and use of balloon post-dilation. However, self-expandable valves with balloon post-dilation showed lower transprosthetic gradients.","['Manuela Muratori', 'Laura Fusini', 'Gloria Tamborini', 'Paola Gripari', 'Sarah Ghulam Ali', 'Valentina Mantegazza', 'Anna Garlaschè', 'Francesco Doni', 'Andrea Baggiano', 'Francesco Cannata', 'Alberico Del Torto', 'Fabio Fazzari', 'Antonio Frappampina', 'Daniele Junod', 'Riccardo Maragna', 'Saima Mushtaq', 'Luigi Tassetti', 'Alessandra Volpe', 'Stefano Galli', 'Franco Fabbiocchi', 'Marco Gennari', 'Marco Agrifoglio', 'Antonio L Bartorelli', 'Federico De Marco', 'Mauro Pepi', 'Gianluca Pontone']",European heart journal.

40370003,Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement for Structural Valve Deterioration After Aortic Valve Neocuspidization.,"BACKGROUND: Evidence on structural valve deterioration (SVD) after aortic valve neocuspidization (AVNeo) remains limited. While transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) offers a less invasive option, its feasibility is unclear. This study aimed to characterize SVD patients post-AVNeo and to assess TAVR feasibility.
METHODS: This retrospective study included 11 patients who underwent TAVR for SVD after AVNeo in Sendai Kousei Hospital between June 2017 and August 2024. Four patients with aortic stenosis (AS) and seven with aortic regurgitation (AR) due to SVD were included.
RESULTS: AS-SVD group showed shorter time interval from AVNeo to TAVR (50.5 [28.3-98.3] vs. 107.0 [97.0-131.0] months, p = 0.04) and smaller aortic annulus area (316.5 [259.8-375.0] vs. 538.0 [440.0-582.0] mm2, p = 0.005) than AR-SVD group. In TAVR, technical success was achieved in 91% of cases. Although coronary obstruction is a concern due to the long leaflet, no case occurred. Misidentification of the basal ring plane caused by the slack cusp resulted in second valve implantation (one case) and new conduction disturbance (two cases) due to deep implantation, and aortic contained rupture (one case) for oversized valve selection.
CONCLUSIONS: Rapid AS-SVD progression and AR-SVD occurring later than previously reported were observed, highlighting the need for further studies on AVNeo durability. TAVR after AVNeo was feasible. Special precautions for coronary obstruction may be unnecessary. Careful hinge point placement at the boundary between pericardial cusps and the annulus was a key to CT-based basal ring determination in patients after AVNeo.","['Natsuko Satomi', 'Masaki Miyasaka', 'Yusuke Enta', 'Yoshiko Munehisa', 'Yusuke Toki', 'Masaki Nakashima', 'Makoto Saigan', 'Yuta Kobayashi', 'Yun Teng', 'Manabu Maeda', 'Momo Kosuga', 'Kazuo Abe', 'Masataka Taguri', 'Yukihiro Hayatsu', 'Masaki Hata', 'Norio Tada']",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,2025-05-14,10.1002/ccd.31583,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.31583,,Paid,Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement for Structural Valve Deterioration After Aortic Valve Neocuspidization SATOMI 2025,Not available,"['Structural Valve Deterioration', 'Aortic Valve Neocuspidization', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Valve Neocuspidization', 'Structural Valve', 'Valve Deterioration', 'Aortic Valve', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Valve', 'Valve Replacement']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['aortic valve neocuspidization', 'coronary obstruction', 'structural valve degeneration', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"
40367359,Impact of Device Type and Orientation on Post-Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Complications in Bicuspid Aortic Valve Patients: A Computational Study.,"Currently, no clinical modality reliably assists clinicians in selecting the optimal transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) device orientation. This is critical for the growing population of young bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) TAVR candidates, who are at high risk for post-procedural complications. We aim to develop a predictive computational modeling workflow to identify which TAVR device and orientation will minimize the risk of paravalvular leakage (PVL), coronary obstruction, and flow-induced thrombogenicity. We compared the risk of post-TAVR complications across more than 30 device orientation combinations by virtually implanting self-expandable and balloon-expandable TAVR devices in three BAV patients. PVL severity varied significantly with device orientation, reaching up to 22.03 mL/beat with certain self-expandable devices. For self-expandable devices, orientations that ensured the shortest distance between the taller skirt region and PVL regions minimized PVL. A shorter frame height in balloon-expandable devices was insufficient to cover PVL regions in certain patients. Pearson correlation demonstrated a negative relationship between device oversizing and PVL. The risk of flow-induced thrombogenicity was positively correlated with PVL severity. A patient-specific computational modeling workflow can identify the optimal TAVR device and orientation, minimizing life-threatening post-TAVR complications and facilitating future reinterventions for young BAV TAVR candidates.","['Salwa Anam', 'Brandon Kovarovic', 'Puja Parikh', 'Marvin Slepian', 'Ashraf Hamdan', 'Rami Haj-Ali', 'Danny Bluestein']",ASAIO journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs : 1992),2025-05-14,10.1097/MAT.0000000000002459,https://doi.org/10.1097/MAT.0000000000002459,,Paid,Impact of Device Type and Orientation on Post Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Complications in Bicuspid Aortic Valve Patients A Computational Study ANAM 2025,Not available,"['Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Bicuspid Aortic Valve', 'Aortic Valve', 'Post-Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Aortic Valve Patients', 'Valve Replacement Complications', 'Valve Replacement', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'Bicuspid Aortic', 'Computational Study']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['TAVR', 'bicuspid aortic valve', 'coronary obstruction', 'digital twin', 'paravalvular leakage', 'predictive computational modeling']"

PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases were searched until November 2024 for studies reporting PPI incidence within 30 days post-TAVR. A random-effect model was used to pool risk ratios (RR) and standardized mean differences (SDM) for binary and continuous risk factors. Network meta-analysis estimated pooled risk differences (ΔRR) for binary predictors with male sex as the reference. Significant predictors were ranked based on their surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) values. A total of 108 studies comprising 77,538 patients (14,560 requiring PPI) were included. Male sex (RR: 1.13), baseline atrial fibrillation (AF) (RR: 1.12), 2nd degree Mobitz I (RR: 5.16) and Mobitz II (RR: 2.30) atrioventricular blocks (AVB), 3rd degree AVB (RR: 13.46), left anterior (LAHB) (RR: 1.79) and posterior hemiblocks (LPHB) (RR: 2.57), bifascicular block (RR: 2.34), right bundle branch block (RBBB) (RR: 3.20) and intraprocedural AVB (RR: 4.15) were identified as predictors for PPI post-TAVR. The risk of PPI was higher with self-expandable valves (RR: 1.79), subclavian access (RR: 1.75), and 29 mm prostheses (RR: 1.33) compared to balloon-expandable valves, transfemoral access, and 23 mm prostheses. Network meta-analysis ranked 3rd degree AVB (SUCRA <0.01), Mobitz I AVB (SUCRA: 0.14), Mobitz II AVB (SUCRA: 0.33), intraprocedural AVB (SUCRA: 0.42), bifascicular block (SUCRA: 0.48), RBBB (SUCRA: 0.49) and LPHB (SUCRA: 0.54) as major predictors of PPI in descending order of significance. In conclusion, clinicians should closely monitor conduction abnormalities as key predictors of PPI following TAVR. Additionally, other risk factors such as subclavian access, self-expanding implantation, AF, large prosthesis diameter, and male sex should not be overlooked.","['Negin Sadat Hosseini Mohammadi', 'Kiarash Tavakoli', 'Morvarid Taebi', 'Ali Zafari', 'Mobina Riahi', 'Mohammad Mahdi Molaei', 'Mashood Ahmad Farooqi', 'Ramtin Khanipour', 'Houshang Bavandpour Karvane', 'Soraya Shahrzad', 'Marmar Vaseghi', 'Ghanunjaya R Lakkirrddy', 'Jishanth Mattumpuram', 'Stylianos Tzeis', 'Yaser Jenab', 'Kaveh Hosseini']",The American journal of cardiology,2025-05-21,10.1016/j.amjcard.2025.05.009,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjcard.2025.05.009,,Paid,Comparative Prognostic Value of Risk Factors for Predicting Pacemaker Implantation After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement A Systematic Review and Network Meta analysis MOHAMMADI 2025,Not available,"['Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Predicting Pacemaker Implantation', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Systematic Review', 'Permanent pacemaker implantation', 'Predicting Pacemaker', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'Valve Replacement', 'SUCRA', 'Aortic Valve']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['artificial', 'atrioventricular block', 'cardiac conduction disorders', 'pacemaker', 'risk factors', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"
40334981,Prevalence and clinical outcomes of permanent conduction disturbances after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.,"BACKGROUND: A new-onset conduction disturbance is a major concern in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) but can resolve over time. This study aimed to evaluate the recovery in conduction disturbances post-TAVR and its association with clinical outcomes.
METHODS: This retrospective study included 780 TAVR patients at St. Marianna University between January 2016 and March 2023. Patients were stratified into four groups based on conduction status at six months post-TAVR: no conduction disturbance, recovered conduction disturbance [defined as a post-procedural pacemaker implantation with cumulative right ventricular pacing <40 % or complete left bundle branch block (CLBBB) at discharge but not at six months], permanent conduction disturbance (defined as pacemaker implantation with cumulative right ventricular pacing ≥40 % or CLBBB at both discharge and six months), and preprocedural conduction disturbance. The primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalization. The secondary outcome was the change in cardiac damage from pre-procedure to one-year post-TAVR.
RESULTS: Of 780 patients, 220 (28 %) had new-onset CLBBB or required a pacemaker implantation at discharge. Among these, 99 (45 %) had permanent conduction disturbances at six months. Over a median follow-up of 788 days, both permanent and preprocedural conduction disturbances were significantly associated with a higher incidence of heart failure hospitalization [hazard ratio (HR) 3.63; 95 % confidence interval (CI): 2.04-6.47, p < 0.01 and HR 2.50; 95 % CI: 1.27-4.90, p < 0.01), although no difference in all-cause mortality was observed. In contrast, the prognosis of patients with recovered conduction disturbance was comparable with those with no conduction disturbance. Patients with permanent and preprocedural conduction disturbances showed significant worsening cardiac damage.
CONCLUSION: Permanent and preprocedural conduction disturbances after TAVR were associated with increased heart failure hospitalizations, while the prognostic impact of recovered conduction disturbance may be limited.","['Takahiko Kai', 'Masaki Izumo', 'Masahiro Sekiguchi', 'Tetsu Tanaka', 'Taishi Okuno', 'Yukio Sato', 'Shingo Kuwata', 'Masashi Koga', 'Ikutaro Nakajima', 'Kenichi Sasaki', 'Yasuhiro Tanabe', 'Tomoo Harada', 'Yoshihiro J Akashi']",Journal of cardiology,2025-05-19,10.1016/j.jjcc.2025.04.013,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jjcc.2025.04.013,,Paid,Prevalence and clinical outcomes of permanent conduction disturbances after Transcatheter aortic valve replacement KAI 2025,Not available,"['aortic valve replacement', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'conduction disturbance', 'conduction', 'preprocedural conduction disturbances', 'valve replacement', 'preprocedural conduction', 'recovered conduction disturbance', 'permanent conduction disturbances', 'aortic valve']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['Aortic stenosis', 'Conduction disturbance', 'Transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"
40252070,Valve Dragging Technique in Valve Migration After Self-Expanding Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) may be considered for patients with symptomatic severe aortic regurgitation at high surgical risk.
CASE SUMMARY: This article presents the case of a 74-year-old man who presented with dyspnea and was diagnosed with severe aortic regurgitation. TAVR with a self-expanding valve was performed but complicated with valve migration toward the left ventricle, resulting in severe paravalvular regurgitation. Ultimately, the valve dragging technique was used to reposition the initial valve and a second valve was implanted, achieving satisfactory final outcomes.
DISCUSSION: This technique provides a novel strategy for valve migration after TAVR, avoiding surgical reintervention.

40252068,Unusual Case of Acute Type A Aortic Dissection During TAVR Bailout With a Self-Expanding Valve.,"BACKGROUND: Over the past 2 decades, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has emerged as a widely accepted treatment for patients with severe aortic valve stenosis. Acute aortic dissection, although rare, is a life-threatening complication associated with TAVR.
CASE SUMMARY: An older man with severe aortic stenosis underwent TAVR. During valve deployment, catheter manipulation caused intimal disruption, leading to acute type A aortic dissection (TAAD). Remarkably, the dissection spontaneously sealed after prosthetic valve placement, thereby avoiding emergency surgery. A 6-month follow-up computed tomography angiography scan showed no extension of the dissection.
DISCUSSION: In the case we report, the dissection spontaneously sealed with the use of a prosthetic valve, a finding that reinforces the feasibility of nonsurgical management of iatrogenic TAAD during TAVR in select cases.

CASE SUMMARY: A 72-year-old man with type 0 BAV and sinus of Valsalva aneurysm underwent transapical J-Valve implantation for severe stenosis. Post-procedural incremental paravalvular leak (PVL) due to aneurysm-related malapposition was successfully treated with a self-expanding valve-in-valve (ViV) prosthesis (TaurusElite, 29 mm). Multimodal imaging, including echocardiography, computed tomography angiography, and 3-dimensional-printed modeling, ensured precise sealing with excellent hemodynamic results.
DISCUSSION: We report the first case of self-expanding ViV for PVL after J-Valve TAVR in type 0 BAV with aortic root aneurysm. This case underscores the feasibility of self-expanding ViV in complex BAV anatomy with concomitant aortic root pathology sighting into optimal device selection and imaging integration.

40035527,Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation in Brazilian Public Health System: A Single-Center Experience.,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has been established as the treatment of choice for severe aortic stenosis in high-risk patients as well as patients above 75 years old in all risk spectrums. Despite its worldwide adoption, implementation in lower-middle-income countries such as the Brazilian public health system (SUS, acronym in Portuguese) is incipient.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate TAVI exclusively within SUS patients.
METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study in a public tertiary hospital in southern Brazil. All patients who underwent TAVI between 2018 and 2024 were included. The cohort was divided into 2 temporal periods: from July 2018 to December 2022 (n = 60) and January 2023 to October 2024 (n = 65). The clinical and procedural characteristics and in-hospital, as well as 1 year of outcomes, were evaluated according to Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 (VARC-2) criteria.
RESULTS: During the study period, 125 patients underwent TAVI. The average age was 80 years (± 10), and 49.6% were male. The mean aortic valve area was 0.76 cm² and the mean gradient was 45 (±13) mm Hg. The mean STS predicted risk of mortality (STS-PROM) score was 4.6% (±3.6).

However, currently, available commercial bioprosthetic heart valves prepared from glutaraldehyde (GA)-crosslinked xenografts have limited durability because of various factors, including severe cytotoxicity, inflammatory response, poor pro-endothelialization ability and calcification. Therefore, the development of valve materials with better performance is urgent. In this work, we first synthesized Cu-doped carbon dots (CuCDs) with excellent biocompatibility and high stability using sodium citrate, ethylenediamine and copper chloride. Subsequently, oxidized chondroitin sulfate (OCS) was used to crosslink the decellularized bovine pericardium to obtain OCS-BP followed by loading CuCDs onto the surface of this OCS-fixed BP sample through amide bonds formed by an EDC/NHS-catalyzed reaction between the functional groups on CuCDs and OCS-BP to prepare the BHV (CuCDs-OCS-BP) with specific properties. Relevant experiments conducted both in vivo and in vitro indicate that CuCDs-OCS-BP with good stability showed improved mechanical properties, compliance and flexibility, encouraging HUVEC-cytocompatibility, excellent anti-blood cell adhesion, antithrombogenic properties, anti-inflammatory and anti-calcification properties, and a good endothelialisation ability due to the catalytic generation of endogenous nitric oxide. Overall, CuCDs-OCS-BP is a promising material for BHVs.","['Shubin Shi', 'Xu Wei', 'Xu Peng', 'Xinyun Pu', 'Shaoxiong Feng', 'Xi Gao', 'Xixun Yu']",Journal of materials chemistry.

Following the PRISMA guidelines, we included both non-randomized studies and randomized clinical trials that reported AKI criteria and patients' surgical risk in patients with aortic stenosis by searching PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science until late September. We executed a random-effects model in Review Manager to pool effect estimates of AKI incidence or the need for dialysis as an odds ratio (OR) and I2 heterogeneity, and we utilized R for meta-regression to address any heterogeneity with subgroup analysis for surgical risk, AKI criteria, and study design. We used the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS) and the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool (RoB-1) for risk of bias assessment and GRADE for certainty assessment. Involving 17 studies and a total of 13,777 patients, we found that the AKI incidence was significantly lower in TAVR compared to SAVR (OR = 0.36; 95% CI: [0.30, 0.44], I2 = 55%, P = 0.003), along with the need for dialysis (OR = 0.35; 95% CI: [0.19, 0.63], I2 = 0%, P = 0.92). The study also found that intermediate and low-risk patients had more favorable outcomes. However, the retrospective study design and VARC-2 criteria were associated with unfavorable outcomes.

The aim of the study is to investigate the clinical results of patients undergoing TAVR with or without concomitant significant TR. Methods: Patients undergoing TAVR were divided into two groups according to TR severity: none/mild TR (low-grade) and moderate/severe TR (significant). Data were analysed and compared. Primary endpoint was the mortality 1-year. Secondary endpoints were re-hospitalization and the degree of postoperative and 1-year TR. Results: TAVR procedures were performed in 345 patients between September 2011 and February 2020. Median STS score was 4.3% (IQR: 2.6-7.2), median LVEF was 59.0% (IQR: 45.0-62.0), median aortic area was 0.70cm2 (IQR: 0.60-0.86), median mean gradient was 43.0mmHg (IQR: 36.0-53.0). Before TAVR, 297 patients (86.1%) had low-grade TR and 48 (13.9%) significant TR. Mean age was 82.4 ± 5.7 and 83.8 ± 6.2 years in low-grade and significant TR group, respectively (p = 0.109), with 47.5% (low-grade TR) and 56.3% (significant TR) of female patients (p = 0.279). Patients showed differences in EuroSCORE-II (3.2% (IQR: 1.9-5.7) in low-grade TR vs. 5.6% (IQR: 3.7-8.1) in significant TR; p < 0.001), impaired right ventricular function (3.0% vs. 20.8%; p < 0.001) and pulmonary hypertension (9.1% vs. 39.6%; p < 0.001). Mean valve size was 27.7 ± 2.9 mm. Hospital mortality was 2.0% in low-grade TR and 4.2% in significantTR patients (p = 0.308). Among discharged patients (n = 337), seven patients died within 30 days (2.0% low-grade TR; 2.1% significant TR; logrank test p = 0.154) and 40 were re-hospitalized for heart failure (11.1% low-grade TR; 14.6% significant TR; p = 0.470). After one year, 26 patients died, corresponding to a mortality of 7.9 deaths per 100-person year (95% CI 5.2-12.0) in low-grade TR group and 9.1 deaths per 100-person year (95% CI 3.4-24.3) in significant TR group (logrank test p = 0.815), with HR (low grade vs. significant TR) of 0.87, 95% CI 0.26-2.89. Re-hospitalization for heart failure was 16.5% and 19.6% for low-grade and significant TR, respectively (p = 0.713). Echocardiographic and functional changes over time showed no significant interaction between TR and time.

Surgical aortic valve replacement remains the standard treatment for symptomatic patients. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is an alternative for those at high surgical risk; however, its use is limited by higher complication rates and the lack of suitable valve options. Previously, balloon-expandable valves were available only in sizes up to 32 mm, restricting their application in patients with larger aortic annuli. We report the first use of the 35 mm balloon-expandable Myval XXL valve with a long 24 French Python introducer sheath for TAVR in a patient with non-calcific aortic regurgitation and an annular area of 722 mm².

40421696,Effectiveness and Safety of Myval Versus Other Transcatheter Valves in Patients Undergoing TAVI: A Meta-Analysis.,"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has changed the treatment of aortic stenosis. The Myval transcatheter heart valve (THV), a novel balloon-expandable THV, has shown promising outcomes. Our aim is to compare the comparative safety and effectiveness of Myval THV against established THVs, such as Sapien and Evolut. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted, comparing the Myval THV with other contemporary THVs. Primary endpoints were periprocedural, 30-day and 1-year all-cause mortality. Seven studies involving 3106 patients (1027 Myval; 2079 other THVs) were included. No significant differences were observed in the primary endpoints. Myval demonstrated higher procedural success (RR: 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01-1.07, I² = 29%) and lower rates of permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI) during the index hospitalization (RR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.36-0.92, I² = 23%) and 30-days (RR: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.40-0.89, I² = 43%), compared to other THV. At 30-day, Myval was associated with lower rates of moderate or severe transvalvular aortic regurgitation (RR: 0.33, 95% CI: 0.11-0.98, I² = 57%) and minor vascular complications (RR: 0.45, 95% CI: 0.23-0.90, I² = 0%). When compared to self-expandable THV, Myval was associated with higher procedural and device success, higher early safety, lower risk for PPI, minor vascular complications and at least moderate transvalvular AR. When compared to Sapien, procedural success and risk for in-hospital PPI was borderline higher and lower in favor of Myval, respectively. The Myval THV demonstrates comparable safety and effectiveness to contemporary THVs, with advantages in procedural success, PPI, and vascular complications.","['Anastasios Apostolos', 'Nikolaos Ktenopoulos', 'Maria Drakopoulou', 'Alfonso Ielasi', 'Vasileios Panoulas', 'Andreas Baumbach', 'Konstantinos Tsioufis', 'Patrick Serruys', 'Konstantinos Toutouzas']",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,2025-05-27,10.1002/ccd.31611,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.31611,,Paid,Effectiveness and Safety of Myval Versus Other Transcatheter Valves in Patients Undergoing TAVI A Meta Analysis APOSTOLOS 2025,Not available,"['Patients Undergoing TAVI', 'Undergoing TAVI', 'Myval Versus', 'Myval', 'Myval THV', 'Patients Undergoing', 'THV', 'Myval transcatheter heart', 'TAVI', 'Transcatheter aortic valve']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['TAVR', 'aortic valve', 'balloon‐expandable', 'self‐expandable', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study on a cohort of consecutive patients who underwent TAVR utilizing Myval THV from September 2021 to August 2023 at a tertiary care cardiac center. We collected baseline characteristics, pre- and post-procedural echocardiographic findings, procedural details, in-hospital outcomes, VARC-3 technical success, and complications. Additionally, patients were followed up for 3 months concerning their clinical outcomes.
RESULTS: The study population comprised 92 TAVR patients with a mean age of 76.8 ± 7.3 years, 66.3% were male, and the mean STS score was 5.9 ± 3.2%. The most common valve sizes used were 24.5 mm (30.4%), 23 mm (26.1%), and 27.5 mm (17.4%). Pre-dilation was performed in 32 cases (34.8%), achieving a 93.5% technical success rate. In-hospital mortality occurred in three patients (3.3%), which included one annulus rupture. Permanent pacemaker implantation was required in six patients (6.5%). Three patients (3.3%) exhibited 3+ paravalvular leakage demonstrated by angiography. The New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class showed significant improvement from baseline to discharge (p < 0.0001). At the 3-month follow-up, five patients encountered mortality (5.4), and three experienced an episode of stroke or transient ischemic attack (3.2%). Two other patients were hospitalized due to cardiovascular events during the 3-month follow-up.

40421252,The Impact of Malnutrition on Perioperative Ischemic Stroke in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR): A Retrospective Cohort Study of the National Inpatient Sample.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Ischemic stroke is a serious risk for patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). The relationship between malnutrition and post-TAVR ischemic stroke remains unclear. This study investigates this association using the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) data.
METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted using NIS data from 2012 to 2021. We included patients who underwent TAVR and were diagnosed with malnutrition based on ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes. Patients under 18 years, with a history of preoperative stroke, with both ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, or with incomplete data were excluded. Logistic regression was performed to evaluate the association between malnutrition and ischemic stroke, adjusting for potential confounders. Sensitivity analyses included stratified analysis and propensity score matching.
RESULTS: Among 364,580 TAVR patients, 10,415 (2.86%) were diagnosed with malnutrition. Malnourished patients were older (78.04 vs. 77.40), predominantly white (85.69%), and had a higher incidence of ischemic stroke (11.47% vs. 7.25%, p < 0.001). After adjusting for common ischemic stroke risk factors, malnutrition was significantly associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke (aOR: 1.51; 95% CI: 1.31-1.74). This association remained significant in the propensity-matched cohort. Subgroup analyses consistently showed associations between malnutrition and stroke risk across various demographic and clinical factors. Time trend analysis showed no significant difference in the annual incidence of perioperative ischemic stroke between malnourished patients with or without cerebral embolic protection devices (p = 0.439).
CONCLUSION: Malnutrition is associated with a higher risk of ischemic stroke following TAVR, highlighting the need for targeted interventions.","['Haowei Li', 'Guangzhi Cong', 'Xueping Ma', 'Bo Shi', 'Congyan Ye', 'Rui Yan', 'Shizhe Fu', 'Kairu Wang', 'Shaobin Jia', 'Jingjing Wang']",Health science reports,2025-05-27,10.1002/hsr2.70860,https://doi.org/10.1002/hsr2.70860,PMC12104818,Free,The Impact of Malnutrition on Perioperative Ischemic Stroke in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement TAVR A Retrospective Cohort Study of the National Inpatient Sample LI 2025,pdfs\The Impact of Malnutrition on Perioperative Ischemic Stroke in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement TAVR A Retrospective Cohort Study of t.pdf,"['Ischemic Stroke', 'Ningxia Medical University', 'TAVR', 'TAVR ischemic stroke', 'National Inpatient Sample', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Ischemic', 'Stroke', 'Ningxia Medical', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['cerebral embolic protection', 'ischemic stroke', 'malnutrition', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"
40420013,Two birds with one stone: pre-TAVI coronary CT angiography combined with FFR helps screen for coronary stenosis.,"OBJECTIVES: Since coronary artery disease (CAD) is a common comorbidity in patients with aortic valve stenosis, invasive coronary angiography (ICA) can be avoided if significant CAD can be screened with the non-invasive coronary CT angiography (cCTA). This study aims to evaluate the ability of machine learning-based CT coronary fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR) derived from cCTA to aid in the diagnosis of comorbid CAD in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).
METHODS: A total of 100 patients who underwent both cCTA and ICA assessments prior to TAVI procedure between January 2021 and July 2023 were included. Coronary stenosis was assessed using both cCTA data and machine learning-generated CT-FFR image information for patients/major coronary vessels. Coronary lesions with CT-FFR ≤ 0.80 were defined as hemodynamically significant, with ICA serving as the diagnostic gold standard.
RESULTS: A total of 400 major coronary vessels were identified in 100 eligible patients who underwent TAVI. CT-FFR was 86.4% sensitive and 66.1% specific to diagnose CAD, with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 66.7% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 86.0%. The diagnostic accuracy (Acc) was 75.0%, with a false positive rate (FPR) of 33.9%. At the vessel level, CT-FFR showed a sensitivity of 77.6% and a specificity of 76.9%. The PPV was 44.0% and the NPV was 93.6%. The Acc was 77.0% and the FPR was 23.1%. For all patient/vessel units, CT-FFR outperformed cCTA.
CONCLUSION: Machine learning-based CT-FFR can effectively detect coronary hemodynamic abnormalities. Combined with preoperative cCTA in TAVI patients, it is an effective tool to rule out significant CAD, reducing unnecessary coronary angiography in this high-risk population.

40418351,Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) after transcatheter aortic valve implantation in aortic stenosis patients: exploring a novel threshold for clinically significant improvement after 12 months.,"AIM: The study aimed to determine the proportion of patients with significant improvements in Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) 12 months after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI), using a threshold for physical function (PF) and physical role (RP) domains of the SF-36 questionnaire. Additionally, we explored shared baseline characteristics of patients reporting these improvements.
METHODOLOGY: In this prospective observational study, 88 patients with symptomatic, severe aortic stenosis (AS) and preserved ejection fraction were enrolled between April 2017 and February 2020. Exclusion criteria were clinical instability, pacemaker, chronic AF, comorbidities with life expectancy < 1 year. HRQoL was evaluated before and 12 months after transfemoral TAVI using the Norwegian version 2.0 of SF-36, and presented as mean (95% confidence interval). Other outcome measures were 6-minute walking test and NYHA- classification. Independent samples t-test or Mann-Whitney U test was used for between-group comparisons as appropriate. Logistic regression or Chi2-test were used to explore associations between changes in PF and RP and clinical parameters. Statistical significance was set at p ≤ 0.05, and clinically significant changes in HRQoL were defined as increase of ≥ 15 points in the PF and RP categories.
RESULTS: Mean age of the cohort was 80 ± 6 years. 44 (50%) patients reported clinically significant improvement in PF, and 46 (52%) in the RP domain. Baseline scores were significantly lower in patients reporting clinical improvement after TAVI, with PF scores pre intervention 43.07 (37.37-48.78) vs. 65.34 (59.01-71.68), p < 0.001, and RP 36.01 (29.56-42.46) vs. 59.92 (50.91-68.92), p < 0.001. No significant associations were found between improvement in domain scores and parameters from the routine baseline examination, but having ≥ 15-point improvement correlated to baseline PF and RP scores.
CONCLUSION: Our study highlights the importance of defining a uniform threshold for clinically significant improvement in the SF-36 HRQoL questionnaire for patients undergoing TAVI. Half of the patients reported favorable long-term outcome for PF and RP aspects of SF-36. This emphasizes the importance of HRQoL assessment in the preoperative work up for patients undergoing TAVI.

Severe aortic stenosis is in the elderly treated with transcatheter aortic valve implantation, aiming to improve survival and relieve symptoms. Health- related quality of life is an important outcome to measure after the procedure. However, there are no defined values for what constitutes a significant improvement in this patient group when measuring quality of life using the widely used health-related quality of life questionnaire SF-36.Our study aimed to investigate how many patients had clinically important improvement in physical aspects of quality of life one year after valve implantation. Eighty-eight patients with an average age of 80 years were included. We proposed a new threshold of 15 points for improvement in the physical function and physical role domains of the questionnaire. We found that half of the patients improved in quality of life, and those who improved had lower scores before surgery.The study emphasizes the need for a clear standard for improvement in quality of life in these patients, highlighting the value of assessment of quality of life before and after TAVI.","['Marte Sævik', 'Marit Helen Andersen', 'Jan Otto Beitnes', 'Lars Aaberge', 'Per Steinar Halvorsen']",Journal of patient-reported outcomes,2025-05-26,10.1186/s41687-025-00894-1,https://doi.org/10.1186/s41687-025-00894-1,PMC10598915,Free,Health Related Quality of Life HRQoL after transcatheter aortic valve implantation in aortic stenosis patients exploring a novel threshold for clinically significant improvement after 12 months SÆVIK 2025,pdfs\Health Related Quality of Life HRQoL after transcatheter aortic valve implantation in aortic stenosis patients exploring a novel threshold f.pdf,"['aortic valve implantation', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'Quality of Life', 'aortic valve', 'surgical aortic valve', 'aortic valve replacement', 'TAVI', 'aortic', 'valve implantation', 'Quality']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['Aortic stenosis (AS)', 'Health related quality of life (HRQoL)', 'Minimal clinically important difference (MCID)', 'SF-36', 'Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI)']"
40417940,An evaluation of the SavvyWire as a support wire for TAVR procedures.,"Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) represents a minimally invasive alternative for the treatment of severe symptomatic aortic stenosis and is increasingly adopted in younger and lower-risk patients. A support guidewire placed in the left ventricle is required in all TAVR procedures, and rapid ventricular pacing is frequently used to ensure valve implant stability. Also, recent studies showed a correlation between post-TAVR hemodynamic gradients and clinical outcomes, underscoring the importance of accurate invasive measurements. The SavvyWire™ (Opsens Medical) is a novel support guidewire designed for TAVR procedures that integrates left ventricular pacing and invasive pressure measurement capabilities, enabling continuous hemodynamic monitoring and simplifying the procedure. This review outlines the SavvyWire's™ design features and summarizes clinical evidence supporting its use in TAVR procedures.
What is this article about?This Device Evaluation article focuses on the new transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) support guidewire, the SavvyWire™ (Opsens Medical), an innovative solution that, besides providing proper support for the TAVR procedure, features integrated dedicated ventricular pacing capabilities and a built-in pressure sensor in its distal tip. These functionalities allow its use for rapid pacing for valve implantation and intraprocedural invasive transvalvular assessment, thereby streamlining TAVR procedures and clinical decision-making processes.What were the results?The safety and efficacy of the SavvyWire™ have been demonstrated inthree prospective observational TAVR studies, with effective left ventricular rapid pacing and accurate pressure recordings in the vast majority of cases. Additionally, the support provided by the SavvyWire was comparable to or superior than that of other TAVR workhorse support wires.What do the results of the study mean?This novel TAVR support guidewire can provide safe and effective rapid pacing for valve implantation and accurate direct transvalvular hemodynamic measurements. These additional features make this guidewire an appealing option during TAVR since it can simplify the procedure and help to optimize procedural results.","['Julio I Farjat-Pasos', 'Marisa Avvedimento', 'Josep Rodes-Cabau']",Future cardiology,2025-05-26,10.1080/14796678.2025.2509458,https://doi.org/10.1080/14796678.2025.2509458,,Paid,An evaluation of the SavvyWire as a support wire for TAVR procedures FARJAT-PASOS 2025,Not available,"['TAVR procedures', 'TAVR', 'TAVR support guidewire', 'Opsens Medical', 'support', 'support guidewire', 'pacing', 'SavvyWire', 'procedures', 'ventricular pacing']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['Transcatheter aortic valve replacement', 'innovation', 'invasive hemodynamics', 'left ventricle pacing', 'support guidewire']"
40417790,Impact of Left Ventricular Diastolic Pressure Changes on Clinical Outcomes After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.,"UNLABELLED: Changes in left ventricular (LV) diastolic pressure after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) or their relationship with subsequent outcomes remain poorly clarified. Accordingly, we aimed to assess the changes in invasively measured LV diastolic pressure and their relationship with long-term outcomes in patients undergoing TAVR.
METHODS: In total, 509 patients with severe aortic stenosis who underwent TAVR at 3 tertiary centers were retrospectively included and divided into 2 groups according to changes in LV pre-A pressure after TAVR: Group 1, with no change or decrease in pre-A pressure, and Group 2, presenting an increase in pre-A pressure after TAVR. The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause death and rehospitalization for heart failure.
RESULTS: Group 1 included 39% (n=198) patients, and Group 2 had 61% (n=311) patients. More patients in Group 2 had diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and a larger aortic valve area than in Group 1. During the follow-up period (median, 28 months), 122 primary outcomes were recorded. In Kaplan-Meier analysis, the cumulative incidence of the primary outcome and all-cause death was significantly lower in Group 1 than in Group 2. In multivariable Cox hazard models, Group 1 was independently associated with a favorable primary outcome (hazard ratio, 0.52 [95% CI, 0.34-0.80]; P=0.003).
CONCLUSIONS: Increase in LV pre-A pressure after TAVR is common, and no change or decrease in LV pre-A pressure after TAVR is independently associated with favorable outcomes. Changes in LV pre-A pressure can help identify patient subsets who will maximally benefit from TAVR.","['Jiwon Seo', 'Ah-Ram Kim', 'Iksung Cho', 'Chi Young Shim', 'Geu-Ru Hong', 'Eui-Young Choi', 'Se-Joong Rim', 'Young-Guk Ko', 'Myeong-Ki Hong', 'Jae-Kwan Song', 'Jong-Won Ha']",Journal of the American Heart Association,2025-05-26,10.1161/JAHA.124.039372,https://doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.124.039372,,Paid,Impact of Left Ventricular Diastolic Pressure Changes on Clinical Outcomes After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement SEO 2025,Not available,"['Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Left Ventricular Diastolic', 'Ventricular Diastolic Pressure', 'Left Ventricular', 'pre-A pressure', 'Valve Replacement', 'Diastolic Pressure', 'Aortic Valve', 'TAVR']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['aortic stenosis', 'diastolic function', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"
40415983,A Retrospective Analysis Assessing Paravalvular Leak and Pacemaker Implantation Using TEE and Non-Contrast CT for CKD Patients Compared With CT Angiography for Annular Sizing Pre-TAVR.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become the treatment of choice for many patients with severe aortic stenosis. Proper pre-procedure sizing of the aortic annulus is crucial in preventing post-TAVR complications. This is typically performed with CT angiography, but the use of contrast is controversial in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).
METHODS: This study of 557 patients from 2016 to 2021 sought to evaluate a contrast-sparing protocol for balloon expandable TAVR evaluation in patients with CKD, in which patients with glomerular filtration rate of less than 40 would undergo transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) and CT without contrast (83 patients) for aortic annular sizing instead of CT angiography (445 patients).
RESULTS: We found that there was no significant difference in rates of greater than trace or greater than mild paravalvular leak between the two groups at hospital discharge, 30 days, or 1-year post-TAVR. We also found no difference in rates of permanent pacemaker implantation at these same time points.
CONCLUSIONS: This suggests that TEE and non-contrast CT could be a viable alternative to CTA in patients with CKD, although more research into other variables such as mortality and other post-procedural complications is necessary.","[""Michael O'Shaughnessy"", 'Roxana Tabrizi', 'Derek Pham', 'Nicholas Jackson', 'Olcay Aksoy', 'Andre Akhondi', 'Jeanne Huchting', 'Richard Shemin', 'Murray Kwon', 'Peyman Benharash', 'Brandon Kim', 'Amir Rabbani']",Health science reports,2025-05-27,10.1002/hsr2.70847,https://doi.org/10.1002/hsr2.70847,PMC12098966,Free,A Retrospective Analysis Assessing Paravalvular Leak and Pacemaker Implantation Using TEE and Non Contrast CT for CKD Patients Compared With CT Angiography for Annular Sizing Pre TAVR O'SHAUGHNESSY 2025,pdfs\A Retrospective Analysis Assessing Paravalvular Leak and Pacemaker Implantation Using TEE and Non Contrast CT for CKD Patients Compared With.pdf,"['Patients', 'TAVR', 'TEE', 'David Geffen School', 'Annular Sizing', 'CKD Patients Compared', 'contrast', 'Los Angeles', 'Paravalvular Leak', 'aortic annular sizing']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['TAVR', 'aortic stenosis', 'pacemaker implantation', 'paravalvular leak', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"
40414715,Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes of Cardiac Surgery and Transcatheter Procedures in Patients With Adult Congenital Heart Disease　- Insights From Japanese Registry Data.,"BACKGROUND: Adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) patients often require additional interventions or surgeries in adulthood, presenting new clinical challenges. However, clinical research on the current status and outcomes of cardiac procedures in ACHD patients remains limited.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We analyzed the Japanese Registry of All Cardiac and Vascular Diseases-Diagnosis Procedure Combination (JROAD-DPC) database between April 2013 and March 2021. Patients with ACHD (aged >15 years) who underwent major cardiac surgery and transcatheter procedures were included. We assessed clinical background, treatment, length of hospital stay, and in-hospital mortality. In all, 22,490 patients with ACHD (median age 56 years [interquartile range 36-69 years], 51.1% female) were enrolled. Emergency hospitalizations and in-hospital deaths were observed in 3.7% and 1.1% of cases, respectively. Congenital heart operations with high in-hospital mortality (>5.0%) included aortic arch repair, systemic-to-pulmonary artery shunts, cardiac tumor resection, coronary artery bypass grafting, 3-valve replacement, and ventricular assist device implantation. Although stent graft procedures had the highest in-hospital mortality rate (2.6%), other transcatheter procedures, such as transcatheter patent ductus arteriosus closure, atrial septal defect closure, and catheter ablation, had in-hospital mortality rates of <1.0%.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides fundamental insights into the current clinical characteristics and outcomes associated with procedures in patients with ACHD. The in-hospital mortality rates for both cardiac surgery and transcatheter procedures in Japanese ACHD patients were low, demonstrating acceptable outcomes.","['Takumi Osawa', 'Tomoko Machino-Ohtsuka', 'Ruriko Numata', 'Ayako Kuraoka', 'Mike Saji', 'Koshiro Kanaoka', 'Yoko Sumita', 'Naoto Kawamatsu', 'Hideyuki Kato', 'Yuji Hiramatsu', 'Tomoko Ishizu']",Circulation journal : official journal of the Japanese Circulation Society,2025-05-25,10.1253/circj.CJ-24-0843,https://doi.org/10.1253/circj.CJ-24-0843,,Paid,Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes of Cardiac Surgery and Transcatheter Procedures in Patients With Adult Congenital Heart Disease Insights From Japanese Registry Data OSAWA 2025,Not available,"['Adult Congenital Heart', 'Congenital Heart Disease', 'Japanese Registry Data', 'Adult Congenital', 'Registry Data', 'Congenital Heart', 'Heart Disease', 'Japanese ACHD patients', 'Japanese Registry', 'Transcatheter Procedures']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['Adult congenital heart disease', 'Cardiac surgery', 'Congenital heart disease', 'Japanese Registry of All Cardiac and Vascular Diseases-Diagnosis Procedure Combination (JROAD-DPC)', 'Percutaneous interventions']"
40414547,Balancing cost and care: analyzing commercial pricing for TAVR and SAVR.,"In a nationwide examination of commercial prices for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR), we observed substantial markups and variability across hospitals, payers and plan types-including differences exceeding $90,000 among insurers. Higher prices did not consistently correlate with better clinical outcomes, suggesting that factors beyond quality of care drive these pricing differences. These findings underscore the need for greater transparency and further investigation into how pricing structures and market forces affect both cost and quality of care.","['Chen Wei', 'Pranav Sharma', 'Ishan Paranjpe', 'Paul A Heidenreich', 'Kevin Schulman', 'Alexander Sandhu']",American heart journal,2025-05-23,10.1016/j.ahj.2025.05.011,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ahj.2025.05.011,,Paid,Balancing cost and care analyzing commercial pricing for TAVR and SAVR WEI 2025,Not available,"['aortic valve replacement', 'analyzing commercial pricing', 'analyzing commercial', 'valve replacement', 'Balancing cost', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'surgical aortic valve', 'aortic valve', 'SAVR', 'TAVR and SAVR']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['Price transparency', 'SAVR', 'TAVR', 'healthcare spending', 'price variation']"
40413055,Study protocol for an internahaational prospective non-randomised trial evaluating the long-term outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve implantation versus surgical aortic valve replacement for aortic-valve stenosis in patients at risk to severe valve obstruction: the TAVISAR trial.,"BACKGROUND: Aortic valve stenosis (AVS) represents the most prevalent primary valvular lesion necessitating surgical intervention or transcatheter intervention in Europe and North America. Its prevalence is increasing at a rapid rate as a consequence of the ageing population. A variety of mechanical interventions are available to determine the management of AVS; however, there is currently a paucity of robust data with which to perform a comparative analysis of the efficacy of surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) and that of conventional stented xenograft bioprostheses (BP) or sutureless aortic valves (SAV) and transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). The present study aims to compare the effectiveness and clinical outcomes of SAVR using BP or SAV technique and TAVI in patients with severe AVS.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A collaboration between three cardiac surgery centres across two European countries has resulted in the conception of the Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation vs Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement trial. This prospective non-randomised trial is designed to evaluate the long-term outcomes of TAVI in comparison to SAVR for AVS in patients at risk of severe valve obstruction. The registry will enrol successive patients who have undergone mechanical intervention for AVS between January 2015 and December 2025. Investigators will assess the difference between replacement procedures for both the standard surgical approach and the transcatheter procedure. The principal clinical outcome under consideration will be the composite degree of all-cause mortality, ischaemic stroke or rehospitalisation at 10 years. The present study will also have a number of secondary endpoints, including all-cause mortality, followed by functional status, hospitalisation, neurocognition, physiological measures (echocardiographic assessment), adverse events and reoperation.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: It is hypothesised that the nature of the trials will serve to minimise bias related to institutional volume and surgical experience. Each participating centre is required to have an aortic valve programme that enables proper follow-up and management of any late aortic events following replacement surgery for the AVS. The data collected will provide valuable insight into the comparative effectiveness of various surgical approaches, both standardised and advanced, in aortic valve surgery and TAVI. This comprehensive analysis will contribute significantly to the development of robust international guidelines.

40412426,"ACURATE neo2 valve versus commercially available transcatheter heart valves in patients with severe aortic stenosis (ACURATE IDE): a multicentre, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial.","BACKGROUND: ACURATE neo2 is an open-cell, supra-annular, self-expanding transcatheter heart valve that is commercially available in over 50 countries but has not previously been evaluated in a randomised trial. ACURATE-IDE aimed to prospectively evaluate the safety and efficacy of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with the ACURATE neo2 valve compared with commercially available valves for the treatment of severe symptomatic aortic stenosis.
METHODS: In this multicentre, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial, patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis and any level of surgical risk were recruited from 71 medical centres in the USA and Canada. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to TAVR with ACURATE neo2 or one of the control valves, SAPIEN 3 (SAPIEN 3 or SAPIEN 3 Ultra) or Evolut, using permuted block randomisation with a pseudo-random number generator, and stratified by the clinical investigation site and type of control valve. All devices were implanted according to the manufacturer's instructions. The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause mortality, all stroke, and rehospitalisation at 1 year, tested for non-inferiority using a Bayesian approach. The primary analysis was performed in the intention-to-treat population and sensitivity analyses were done in the implanted population. The non-inferiority margin was 8·0%. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03735667, and is ongoing.
FINDINGS: Between June 10, 2019, and April 19, 2023, 1500 patients were recruited, of whom 752 were randomly assigned to the ACURATE neo2 group and 748 to the control group. The median age of participants was 79 years (IQR 74-83). 778 (51·9%) of 1500 patients were female and 721 (48·1%) were male. At 1 year, the posterior median probability of the primary composite endpoint was higher in the ACURATE neo2 group (16·2% [95% Bayesian credible interval 13·4-19·1) than in the control group (9·5% [7·5-11·9]; between-group difference 6·6% [3·0-10·2]). The upper bound of treatment difference exceeded the prespecified non-inferiority margin of 8%, with a posterior probability of treatment difference of >0·999. At 1 year, the ACURATE neo2 group, had significantly higher Kaplan-Meier rates of the composite endpoint of all-cause mortality, all stroke, and rehospitalisation (14·8% [95% CI 12·5-17·6] vs 9·1% [7·2-11·4]; hazard ratio [HR] 1·71 [95% CI 1·26-2·33]; p=0·0005). At 1 year, all-cause mortality occurred in 36 of 752 patients in the ACURATE neo2 group versus 28 of 748 patients in the control group (HR 1·30 [95% CI 0·80-2·14]), stroke in 41 patients versus 25 patients (1·68 [1·02-2·75]), and rehospitalisation in 38 patients versus 25 patients (1·57 [0·95-2·61]). Cardiovascular mortality (3·7% vs 1·8%, p=0·024) and spontaneous myocardial infarction at 1 year (2·4% vs 0·7%, p=0·0092) were more frequent in the ACURATE neo2 group than in the control group. Prosthetic valve aortic regurgitation (central plus paravalvular) at 1 year was significantly more frequent in the ACURATE neo2 group than in the control group (mild aortic regurgitation 42·5% vs 24·8%, p<0·0001; moderate 4·4% vs 1·8%, p=0·0070; severe 0·5% vs 0%; p=0·12).
INTERPRETATION: In patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis, TAVR with ACURATE neo2 did not meet non-inferiority and resulted in significantly worse outcomes with respect to the primary endpoint of composite of all-cause mortality, all stroke, and rehospitalisation at 1 year when compared with commercial valves.

40410432,Efficacy and safety of transfemoral TAVR in pure aortic regurgitation patients: a single center study.,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) via the femoral approach in patients with pure aortic regurgitation (AR), with a focus on mortality, adverse event rates, cardiac function, and clinical symptom improvement. The study utilised a single-centre experience to provide insights and offer guidance for the management of TAVR in AR patients. Patients with aortic valve pathology who underwent TAVR at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, from January 2018 to March 2023 were enrolled. They were classified into two groups: pure AR and aortic stenosis (AS) based on preoperative transthoracic echocardiography. We compared baseline characteristics, imaging data, surgical outcomes, and follow-up conditions between them. We focused on the safety and efficacy of TAVR in patients with AR and evaluated these results using regression analysis. The study cohort comprised 87 patients, with 21 in the AR group and 63 in the AS group. We revealed that AR patients exhibited low mortality and adverse event rates following transfemoral TAVR, with notable improvements in postoperative cardiac function and substantial symptom relief. However, the rates of paravalvular leak (PVL), permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation, and valve-in-valve procedures were relatively elevated. While these findings suggest that TAVR may represent a viable therapeutic option for patients with AR, the elevated rates of PVL, PPM implantation, and readmission underscore the need for further investigation, with larger cohorts and extended follow-up, to more robustly evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of this approach.","['Jie Feng', 'Haixia Wei', 'Shiyuan Zhang', 'Yao Li', 'Hangyu Liu', 'Yanqing Wu']",Scientific reports,2025-05-23,10.1038/s41598-025-03214-1,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-03214-1,PMC12102353,Free,Efficacy and safety of transfemoral TAVR in pure aortic regurgitation patients a single center study FENG 2025,pdfs\Efficacy and safety of transfemoral TAVR in pure aortic regurgitation patients a single center study FENG 2025.pdf,"['TAVR', 'aortic valve', 'aortic', 'patients', 'valve', 'transfemoral TAVR', 'aortic regurgitation patients', 'pure aortic regurgitation', 'Affiliated Hospital', 'aortic valve replacement']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['Aortic regurgitation', 'Aortic stenosis', 'Perivalvular leakage', 'TAVR']"

CASE SUMMARY: An 81-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis and peripheral arterial disease (kissing iliac stents) presented for TAVR. Mild resistance was encountered when introducing the 14-F TAVR catheter through an 18-F sheath, but the catheter passed with gentle pressure. While the catheter was advancing up the aorta, a large, calcified mass was seen moving with the distal tip. Retraction of the catheter also retracted the seemingly attached calcific mass. Angiography revealed a catheter-induced avulsed atheroma but no perforation.
DISCUSSION: The TAVR delivery catheter was carefully removed, and the calcific lesion settled infrarenally. Kissing iliac stenting was performed, raising the aortic bifurcation to the juxtarenal aorta and covering the mobile plaque. Angiography showed patent stents with excellent distal aortic and lower extremity runoff.
TAKE-HOME MESSAGES: Although rare, aortic complications can be devastating.

40408797,Impact of Noncoaxial Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation on Clinical Outcomes.,"BACKGROUND: Noncoaxial placement of transcatheter heart valves (THVs) relative to the native aortic annulus is occasionally detected on fluoroscopy after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the impact of noncoaxial TAVR deployment on clinical outcomes.
METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated consecutive patients undergoing transfemoral TAVR in the Bern transcatheter aortic valve implantation registry. Coaxiality between the native annulus and the THV was measured using the 3-cusp view on fluoroscopic images and was defined as the angle between a line intersecting the lower points of native cusps and a line intersecting the lower hinge points of the prosthesis frame. Patients were categorized according to tertiles of coaxiality.
RESULTS: Among 2,025 patients (mean age 81.6 ± 6.5 years, mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality 4.2% ± 3.3%) undergoing TAVR with contemporary devices between February 2014 and June 2023, the mean axial angulation of the device relative to the native annulus was 4.1°. According to Valve Academic Research Consortium-3 criteria, patients in the highest tertile of THV axial angle (range, 4.8-21.7°) had reduced device early safety (56.2% vs 82.7%; aHR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.59-0.76; P < 0.001) and higher rates of stage-2 bioprosthetic valve failure at 1-year follow-up (1.5% vs 0.7%; HR: 3.47; 95% CI: 1.26-9.54; P = 0.016), compared to those with coaxial valve positioning (range, 0.1-3.0). Left ventricle outflow tract calcium volume, predilatation, and valve type were independent predictors of noncoaxial valve implantation.

Among patients with acute decompensated aortic stenosis, this study aimed to assess the impact of time to transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) on outcomes, hypothesizing that longer durations are associated with worse outcomes.
METHODS: Using a single-center registry, patients with their first presentation of acute decompensated aortic stenosis who underwent an urgent TAVI during their index admission were included. Time to TAVI was defined as the number of days between hospital admission and TAVI. The primary composite outcome was heart failure hospitalization or all-cause mortality. The secondary composite outcome was heart failure hospitalization or cardiovascular mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 276 patients were included in this study: age 84 (79-88) years, male sex 63.7%, patients requiring cardiopulmonary organ support 3.6%, aortic valve area 0.7 (0.5-0.8) cm2, and left ventricular ejection fraction 55 (37-57)%.

Over a follow-up of 4.6 (3.6-5.7) years, the primary and secondary outcomes occurred in 58% and 35% of patients, respectively. After adjusting for comorbidities, mean gradient, and cardiopulmonary organ support, time to TAVI was associated with both the primary (hazard ratio for every 5 days, 1.09 [95% CI, 1.04-1.16]; P=0.001) and secondary outcomes (hazard ratio for every 5 days, 1.08 [95% CI, 1.01-1.16]; P=0.023).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with acute decompensated aortic stenosis, longer time to TAVI was associated with an increased risk of adverse events at mid-term follow-up.","['Michael McKenna', 'Niromila Nadarajan', 'Sumanto Mukhopadhyay', 'Mick Ozkor', 'Thomas A Treibel', 'Guy Lloyd', 'Sanjeev Bhattacharyya', 'Anthony Mathur', 'Simon Kennon', 'Andreas Baumbach', 'Michael J Mullen', 'Kush P Patel']",Circulation.

40402187,Evolution and prognostic implications of cardiac damage in women after transcatheter aortic valve implantation.,"Recently, a cardiac damage staging system has been proposed in patients with severe AS to improve risk stratification, but there is still paucity of data in women. Accordingly, we aimed to characterize the change in cardiac damage after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), and to assess the prognostic value of cardiac damage staging in women. A total of 334 women (mean age 81 ± 7 years) with severe AS undergoing TAVI were included and retrospectively analyzed. Echocardiography was performed before and 6 months after TAVI. Patients were classified according to the following stages of cardiac damage: 0 = no damage; 1 = left ventricular damage; 2 = left atrial or mitral valve damage; 3 = pulmonary vasculature or tricuspid valve damage; and 4 = right ventricular damage. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. Most patients presented with advanced heart failure symptoms (62% in NYHA III-IV). TAVI consistently improved cardiac damage of at least one stage in 43% of patients at 6-month follow-up. During a median follow-up of 48 months, 79 patients (24%) died. Each increment of both baseline (HR per 1-stage increment 1.537, P = 0.001) and follow-up (HR per 1-stage increment 1.714, P = 0.01) cardiac damage stage were independently associated with all-cause death. Moreover, the re-assessment of cardiac damage at 6-month follow-up provided incremental prognostic value over baseline assessment (Chi-square change = 6.885; P = 0.009). TAVI has a beneficial effect on cardiac function and remodeling in women. Cardiac damage assessed before and 6 months after TAVI showed to be consistently and independently associated with prognosis.","['Rinchyenkhand Myagmardorj', 'Federico Fortuni', 'Xavier Galloo', 'Takeru Nabeta', 'Maria Chiara Meucci', 'Steele C Butcher', 'Frank van der Kley', 'Nina Ajmone Marsan', 'Jeroen J Bax']",The international journal of cardiovascular imaging,2025-05-22,10.1007/s10554-025-03424-8,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10554-025-03424-8,PMC7755038,Free,Evolution and prognostic implications of cardiac damage in women after transcatheter aortic valve implantation MYAGMARDORJ 2025,pdfs\Evolution and prognostic implications of cardiac damage in women after transcatheter aortic valve implantation MYAGMARDORJ 2025.pdf,"['cardiac damage', 'aortic valve implantation', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'cardiac damage staging', 'damage', 'cardiac', 'cardiac damage stage', 'valve damage', 'valve implantation', 'aortic valve']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['Aortic stenosis', 'Prognosis', 'Risk assessment', 'Transcatheter aortic valve implantation', 'Valvular heart disease', 'Women']"
40402169,Long-term results of transcatheter aortic valve replacement in degenerated surgical aortic valves-a propensity score matched analysis.,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to analyse long-term valve function and all-cause mortality of patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) due to degenerated surgical aortic valve (SAV) bioprostheses.
METHODS: In this single-center study, all consecutive patients undergoing TAVR between December 2012 and December 2020 were included. Long-term echocardiographic results, functional status and 5-year all-cause mortality were analysed in patients with TAV-in-SAV and native valve TAVR in a propensity score matched analysis.
RESULTS: Out of 3423 patients who were eligible for the study, 136 experienced bioprosthetic valve dysfunction, whereas 3287 patients underwent native valve TAVR. After 2:1 propensity score matching, baseline characteristics without relation to prior SAVR were comparable between both groups. Regarding 5-year all-cause mortality, no difference was observed between patients with prior SAVR and native valve TAVR, in either unadjusted analysis, or after propensity score matching (corresponding hazard ratio: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.70-1.30, p = 0.75). In addition, while pressure gradients were higher in patients with TAV-in-SAV in long-term echocardiographic follow-up, moderate or severe hemodynamic valve deterioration did not occur more often in this group.
CONCLUSIONS: In this propensity score matched analysis, long-term all-cause mortality and echocardiographic valve function of patients with TAVR in prior bioprosthesis were comparable to patients with native valve TAVR.","['Kornelia Löw', 'Julius Steffen', 'Nike Knufinke', 'Carolin Fröhlich', 'Julius Fischer', 'Magda Haum', 'Hans Theiss', 'Sven Peterss', 'Konstantin Stark', 'Jörg Hausleiter', 'Steffen Massberg', 'Simon Deseive']",Clinical research in cardiology : official journal of the German Cardiac Society,2025-05-22,10.1007/s00392-025-02670-z,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00392-025-02670-z,PMC10984572,Free,Long term results of transcatheter aortic valve replacement in degenerated surgical aortic valves a propensity score matched analysis LÖW 2025,pdfs\Long term results of transcatheter aortic valve replacement in degenerated surgical aortic valves a propensity score matched analysis LW 202.pdf,"['aortic valve', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'surgical aortic valve', 'valve', 'aortic valve implantation', 'severe aortic valve', 'aortic valve replacement', 'aortic', 'native valve TAVR', 'bioprosthetic aortic valves']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['Aortic stenosis', 'Bioprosthetic valve', 'Transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"
40401761,Economic option value associated with surgical aortic valve replacement using a novel bioprosthetic and a future transcatheter aortic valve-in-valve procedure.,"INTRODUCTION: Optimal lifetime management of surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) patients should account for the expected clinical and economic value of the index procedure as well as the future trajectory of health outcomes. This study estimates the discounted per surgery ""total value"" (from the time of initial SAVR operation through 25 years post-surgery) and the option value (after reoperation) that mechanical SAVR patients forego by choosing a device that does not allow for valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve reoperation (ViV/TAVR).
METHODS: The model adopts a US payer perspective and tracks major health events, anti-coagulant monitoring, maintenance, and expenditures associated with these events following initial SAVR procedures, inclusive of costs before and after a potential reoperation. We compare the expected utilization and expenditures for tissue valve patients and mechanical valve patients over a 25-year period. The model also compares the experience of mechanical SAVR patients after reoperation to a counterfactual group receiving ViV/TAVR to estimate option value. Monte Carlo simulation, sensitivity analyses, scenario analyses, and break-even analyses were conducted to account for variation in inputs.
RESULTS: Novel SAVR treatment for aortic stenosis followed by ViV TAVR for reoperation reduces 25-year payer expenditures relative to mechanical valves by either $34,621 (95% CI: 17,426-52,218), $31,363 (95% CI: $19,871 -$43,399) or $23,303 (95% CI: $16,906-$30,075) depending on the age of initial SAVR operation. During this period, the ""option value"" share of overall savings ranges from 8-17% and generally is lower for older patients. Reoperation and anti-coagulant monitoring are important drivers of overall savings and option value.
CONCLUSION: The deterministic and simulation models both demonstrate that novel SAVR tissue valves, followed by a ViV/TAVR, result in lower 25-year expected costs than a treatment strategy using mechanical SAVR valves, and option value is a component of these savings.","['Eric L Keuffel', 'Matt Reifenberger', 'Andrew Pellegrini', 'Pradeep Yadav', 'Vinod H Thourani']",Journal of medical economics,2025-12-27,10.1080/13696998.2025.2503664,https://doi.org/10.1080/13696998.2025.2503664,,Paid,Economic option value associated with surgical aortic valve replacement using a novel bioprosthetic and a future transcatheter aortic valve in valve procedure KEUFFEL 2025,Not available,"['surgical aortic valve', 'aortic valve replacement', 'SAVR', 'mechanical SAVR patients', 'initial SAVR', 'mechanical SAVR', 'initial SAVR operation', 'aortic valve', 'initial SAVR procedures', 'mechanical SAVR valves']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['I10', 'I11', 'I18', 'RESILIA', 'Surgical aortic valve replacement', 'bioprosthetic aortic valve', 'health economics', 'option value', 'outcomes research']"

40399991,Impact of SGLT2-inhibitors on acute kidney injury in diabetic patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).,"BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is associated with significantly worse outcomes, leading to increased short- and long-term mortality. We sought to evaluate the impact of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) on the risk of AKI in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and severe aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing TAVI.
METHODS: Multicenter international registry of consecutive T2DM patients with severe AS undergoing TAVI between 2021 and 2024. The study population was stratified by the presence of chronic kidney disease (CKD), defined according to the KDIGO guideline, and anti-diabetic therapy at hospital admission (SGLT2i versus no-SGLT2i users). AKI was defined according to the Valve Academy Research Consortium 3 (VARC-3) criteria.
RESULTS: The study population consisted of 514 patients stratified into those without CKD (n = 226, 44%), of whom 43 (19%) were treated with SGLT2i, and 288 (56%) with CKD, of whom 71 (24.7%) were on SGLT2i treatment. The median age was 81 [77-84] years, and 60.1% were males. SGLT2i use did not impact renal function in patients without CKD, with AKI occurring in 7.1% of the cases, regardless of SGLT2i use. Among CKD patients, AKI occurred more frequently in no-SGLT2i users compared to those receiving SGLT2i (19.8% versus 8.5%, p = 0.027), with a significant increase in post-TAVI and discharge serum creatinine values for no-SGLT2i users (p = 0.001 after TAVI and p < 0.001 at hospital discharge). Only in the CKD group, the use of SGLT2i was identified as an independent predictor of a lower rate of AKI (OR 0.70, 95%CI 0.42-0.91, p = 0.014). Patients who developed AKI had a higher incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events during follow-up, regardless of CKD (p < 0.025 for both groups).
CONCLUSION: In diabetic patients with CKD undergoing TAVI, SGLT2i therapy was associated with a lower occurrence of AKI compared to those not treated with SGLT2i, suggesting a potential nephroprotective effect in this high-risk population.","['Pasquale Paolisso', 'Marta Belmonte', 'Emanuele Gallinoro', 'Roberto Scarsini', 'Luca Bergamaschi', 'Leonardo Portolan', 'Matteo Armillotta', 'Giuseppe Esposito', 'Elisabetta Moscarella', 'Claudio Montalto', 'Elayne Kelen de Oliveira', 'Francesco Angeli', 'Mateusz Orzalkiewicz', 'Margherita Fabroni', 'Verdiana Galli', 'Nurcan Baydaroglu', 'Francesca Di Lenarda', 'Pasquale Policastro', 'Carlo Terrone', 'Davide Ausiello', 'Giose Vincelli', 'Matteo Casenghi', 'Lucia Scisciola', 'Raffaele Marfella', 'Felice Gragnano', 'Edoardo Conte', 'Dario Pellegrini', 'Alfonso Ielasi', 'Daniele Andreini', 'Jacopo Andrea Oreglia', 'Paolo Calabrò', 'Antonio L Bartorelli', 'Tullio Palmerini', 'Francesco Saia', 'Flavio Ribichini', 'Michelangela Barbieri', 'Marc Vanderheyden', 'Carmine Pizzi', 'Emanuele Barbato']",Cardiovascular diabetology,2025-05-21,10.1186/s12933-025-02773-x,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12933-025-02773-x,PMC12096646,Free,Impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on acute kidney injury in diabetic patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation TAVI PAOLISSO 2025,pdfs\Impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on acute kidney injury in diabetic patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve imp.pdf,"['CKD undergoing TAVI', 'AKI', 'CKD', 'undergoing TAVI', 'TAVI', 'patients', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'aortic valve implantation', 'acute kidney injury', 'aortic valve']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['Acute kidney injury', 'Aortic stenosis', 'Chronic kidney disease', 'SGLT2i', 'Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI)']"
40399075,Prognostic Value of the 6-Minute Walk Test in Patients With Severe Aortic Stenosis.,"BACKGROUND: The prognostic significance of the 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) has not been thoroughly investigated.
METHODS AND RESULTS: This study evaluated 998 patients with severe AS who underwent a 6-min walk test as part of a large multicenter prospective cohort. Patients were categorized as either fast walkers (6MWD ≥300 m; n=515) or slow walkers (6MWD <300 m; n=483). During a median follow-up of 2.3 years, 861 (86.3%) patients underwent surgical or transcatheter aortic valve replacement (AVR; 87.0% of fast walkers vs. 85.5% of slow walkers). The cumulative 3-year incidence of death was significantly lower among fast walkers than slow walkers (10.9% vs. 31.7%; P<0.001). After adjusting for confounders, slow walkers had a significantly higher risk of all-cause mortality than fast walkers (hazard ratio 2.36; 95% confidence interval 1.55-3.58; P<0.001). Stratified analysis by initial treatment strategy revealed that the cumulative 3-year incidence of all-cause death was consistently lower among fast walkers than slow walkers (initial AVR strategy: 10.1% vs. 28.1% [P<0.001]; conservative strategy: 13.4% vs. 46.7% [P<0.001]). Among asymptomatic patients managed conservatively, fast walkers demonstrated a remarkably low cumulative 3-year incidence of all-cause death (8.1%).

40398959,Survival and cause of death after isolated primary aortic valve replacement at Oslo University Hospital (2012-2021): a retrospective registry-based study.,"BACKGROUND: The treatment of aortic valve disease has changed following the introduction of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Hence, the selection of patients for surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR) is changing. Thus, we aimed to study survival and causes of death following surgical AVR at a large Scandinavian Centre in the period 2012-21.
METHODS: Information about the surgical procedure, survival and cause of death was obtained from the National Norwegian Health Registries. The latest clinical information about the deceased patients was made available from the local hospitals and examined to evaluate the causes of death from The Norwegian Cause of Death Registry.
RESULTS: From 2012 to 2021, the number of surgical implantations of aortic valve bioprostheses (AVR(b)) and patient age at the time of surgery decreased. Outcomes were excellent, with 30-day survival of 98.6% following AVR(b) and 99.8% following AVR(m). 1-year survival after AVR(b) improved from 96.4% in the first half to 98.4% in the second half of the study period, probably due to a reduction of operative risk during the study period. Non-cardiovascular mortality was the most frequent cause of death, followed by cancer, cardiovascular and valve-related death. Deaths due to cerebral bleeding or stroke were the least frequent with 10-year estimators of 1.3% and 1.6% following AVR(m) and AVR(b), respectively. The inter-rater reliability between The Norwegian Cause of Death Registry and the journal information provided was moderate, with an unweighted Cohen's kappa of 0.56 (0.47-0.64).
CONCLUSIONS: Valve-related death and death from cerebral bleeding or stroke was rare after surgical AVR. Survival was high and improved during the study period.

40397427,Hemodynamic Impact of Cipepofol vs Propofol During Anesthesia Induction in Patients With Severe Aortic Stenosis: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"IMPORTANCE: Postinduction hemodynamic instability is a frequent complication among patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS). Using cipepofol as the anesthesia agent may reduce the incidence and severity of hemodynamic instability.
OBJECTIVE: To assess whether cipepofol outperforms propofol in maintaining postinduction hemodynamic stability in patients with AS.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This single-center, randomized clinical trial was conducted from June 29, 2023, to July 8, 2024, at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine in China. Patients with AS scheduled for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) were eligible for inclusion.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either cipepofol or propofol as anesthesia induction agents at equipotent doses.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the area under the curve (AUC) of the mean arterial pressure (MAP) difference from baseline during the initial 15 minutes postinduction.
RESULTS: A total of 124 patients with AS scheduled for TAVR were randomized into either the cipepofol group (n = 62) or the propofol group (n = 62). Of 124 patients randomized, 1 patient from each group was excluded due to ineligibility for the TAVR procedure, and data were analyzed for 122 patients (61 patients per group) based on the intention-to-treat principle. Among 122 total patients, mean (SD) age was 72.2 (5.0) years, and 53 patients (43.4%) were female. The cipepofol group exhibited a significantly smaller median (IQR) AUC (-8505.0 mm Hg · s [-12 402.8 to -5130.0]) compared with the propofol group (-13 189.0 mm Hg · s [-17 006.7 to -7593.3]; P < .001). Moreover, compared with the propofol group, the cipepofol group demonstrated a significantly lower incidence of postinduction hypotension (70.5% vs 88.5%; P = .01) and required a smaller median (IQR) dose of norepinephrine during the first 15 minutes postinduction (6.0 μg [0.0-10.0] vs 10.0 μg [5.0-20.0]; P = .006). Additionally, the 2 groups' bispectral indices were comparable.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, cipepofol provided superior hemodynamic stability as an induction agent compared to propofol at equipotent doses and similar anesthesia depths for patients with AS. Therefore, cipepofol could serve as an alternative induction agent to propofol for patients at high cardiovascular risk.

40396898,Continued Versus Interrupted Oral Anticoagulation During Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation: A Meta-Analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: A substantial number of patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) require long-term oral anticoagulants (OAC) owing to comorbidities. This study examined whether continuing oral anticoagulation periprocedurally during TAVR is as safe and effective as interrupting it.
METHODS: A systematic search of the major databases was performed to identify relevant studies. Effect estimates were calculated using risk ratios (RR) and 95% CIs by pooling the data using the inverse-variance random effects model. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.
RESULTS: Four studies were included, with 2962 patients undergoing TAVR with continued OAC (n = 1318) and interrupted OAC (n = 1644). The pooled analysis demonstrated that TAVR with continued OAC had comparable risks for all-cause mortality (RR: 0.91; 95% CI, 0.62-1.34; P = 0.64), cardiovascular mortality (RR: 0.89; 95% CI, 0.43-1.84; P = 0.76), stroke (RR: 0.67; 95% CI, 0.42-1.08; P = 0.09), closure device failure (RR: 0.86; 95% CI, 0.47-1.59; P = 0.64), major/life-threatening bleeding (RR: 0.93; 95% CI, 0.74-1.15; P = 0.49), and major vascular complications (RR: 0.97; 95% CI, 0.79-1.20; P = 0.80) compared with TAVR with interrupted OAC.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing TAVR, continued OAC showed comparable safety and efficacy with interrupted OAC. These findings demonstrate that continuing OAC in the periprocedural period may be a viable option in patients with atrial fibrillation because of comorbidities requiring anticoagulants.","['Hritvik Jain', 'Nandan Patel', 'Muhammad Daoud Tariq', 'Ali Saad Al-Shammari', 'Rozi Khan', 'Jyoti Jain', 'Rahul Patel', 'Faizan Ahmed', 'Raheel Ahmed', 'Thomas Alexander']",American journal of therapeutics,2025-05-21,10.1097/MJT.0000000000001979,https://doi.org/10.1097/MJT.0000000000001979,,Paid,Continued Versus Interrupted Oral Anticoagulation During Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation A Meta Analysis JAIN 2025,Not available,"['Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Versus Interrupted Oral', 'Aortic Valve', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'Valve Replacement', 'undergoing transcatheter aortic', 'Continued Versus Interrupted', 'Versus Interrupted', 'Oral Anticoagulation']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['TAVR', 'anticoagulation', 'aortic stenosis', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"
40396229,Feasibility of Computed Tomography as a Gatekeeper for Invasive Angiography Before TAVR: A Pragmatic Real-World Experience.,"BACKGROUND: Although pretranscatheter aortic valve replacement-computed tomography angiography (TAVR-CTA) has shown a good correlation with invasive coronary angiography (ICA) for ruling out obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD), its clinical effectiveness and safety as a gatekeeper for ICA pre-transcatheter aortic valve replacement (pre-TAVR) remain unclear. This study aims to determine whether routine TAVR-CTA, without premedication, could safely defer and guide the need for ICA pre-TAVR.
METHODS: Patients who underwent TAVR evaluation with either TAVR-CTA or ICA to determine CAD between 2017 and 2022 were included. Patients with prior coronary artery bypass grafts were excluded, and the remaining patients were divided into CAD screening with TAVR-CTA or ICA groups. The primary outcome was symptom-driven revascularization at 1 year post-TAVR.
RESULTS: Among 1165 patients (median age, 81 years; 46% women), 464 were in TAVR-CTA group and 701 were in the ICA group. Prevalence of CAD was similar (37% versus 41%; P=0.2). A total of 53% of patients were exempted from ICA after TAVR-CTA, given the absence of proximal obstructive CAD, whereas 17% had inconclusive TAVR-CTA interpretation, 15% desired for ICA despite CAD exclusion by TAVR-CTA, and 14% had obstructive CAD requiring further ICA. Elevated coronary artery calcium score and the presence of stents were associated with need for ICA after TAVR-CTA. TAVR-CTA revealed a per-patient sensitivity of 89%, specificity of 75%, positive predictive value of 69%, and negative predictive value of 91% for identifying obstructive CAD. Importantly, symptom-driven revascularization, acute coronary syndrome, and unplanned ICA at 1 year after TAVR were all low and not different between TAVR-CTA versus ICA (0.8% versus 1.8%, P=0.158; 1.6% versus 1.7%, P=0.846; 2.7% versus 2.8%, P=0.767; respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: In comparison with routine ICA pre-TAVR, integration of TAVR-CTA in our program resulted in up to 53% of patients exempted from ICA, while maintaining patient safety. This approach could have important clinical implications to improve patient access, experience, value, and throughput.","['Asa Phichaphop', 'Paul Sorajja', 'Maurice Enriquez-Sarano', 'Miho Fukui', 'Atsushi Okada', 'Davide Margonato', 'Mohammed Abed', 'Takahiro Nishihara', 'Hideki Koike', 'Evan Walser-Kuntz', 'John R Lesser', 'Victor Y Cheng', 'Vinayak N Bapat', 'Nadira Hamid', 'João L Cavalcante']",Circulation.

40396187,A Case of Treatment With a Combination of Covered Stents and Artificial Blood Vessel for Iliac Artery Rupture During Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.,"Vascular complications (VCs) associated with Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR), particularly iliac artery rupture, pose significant challenges. We report a case of complete iliac artery disruption during TAVR. A combination of a covered stent and artificial blood vessel repair was employed to achieve revascularization of the iliac artery. In this case, the patient was placed on bed rest for 10 days to avoid stent dislodgement due to early movement and was discharged from the hospital 13 days later. After that, the patient stayed away from significant lower limb activity for 3 months after surgery and underwent enhanced follow-up. Regular follow-up indicated that the patient recovered well, with no significant discomfort in the right lower limb and consistent pulse in the dorsal foot artery on both sides. The treatment of such complications typically involves surgical intervention, while this method shows a new viable option for managing such VCs. By using this method, blood flow can be blocked more quickly than through surgery, which reduced the risk of massive bleeding, death, and limb loss and improved the prognosis.","['Wensheng Zhu', 'Hanqing Deng', 'Weiqing Hu', 'Shixun Wang']",Clinical case reports,2025-05-27,10.1002/ccr3.70523,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccr3.70523,PMC12090355,Free,A Case of Treatment With a Combination of Covered Stents and Artificial Blood Vessel for Iliac Artery Rupture During Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement ZHU 2025,pdfs\A Case of Treatment With a Combination of Covered Stents and Artificial Blood Vessel for Iliac Artery Rupture During Transcatheter Aortic Va.pdf,"['Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Aortic Valve', 'Valve Replacement', 'Clinical Case Reports', 'Iliac Artery Rupture', 'Iliac Artery', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'Artificial Blood Vessel', 'Artery']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['aortic stenosis', 'artery reconstruction', 'iliac artery rupture', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement', 'vascular complication']"
40395684,Perioperative management of transcatheter aortic valve implantation in acquired von Willebrand syndrome secondary to monoclonal gammopathy: a case report.,"BACKGROUND: Acquired von Willebrand syndrome (AvWS) is a rare bleeding disorder associated with conditions like monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). It results from monoclonal antibodies binding to von Willebrand factor (vWF), leading to rapid clearance of vWF and factor VIII (FVIII). Of note, any condition increasing shear stress, such as aortic stenosis (AS), can exacerbate AvWS.
CASE SUMMARY: We report the case of an 81-year-old man with AvWS secondary to MGUS who underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) for severe aortic stenosis. Pre-operative intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) were administered, which normalized FVIII and vWF levels. TAVI was performed without specific haemostatic measures other than vascular closure devices. There were no bleeding complications, and the patient was discharged without antiplatelet therapy. At one-year follow-up, he had no thrombotic or haemorrhagic events.
DISCUSSION: We report the management of a patient affected by AvWS secondary to MGUS who underwent TAVI for severe AS. IVIG were administered preoperatively to temporarily normalize coagulation, as their mechanism of action directly inhibits the increased consumption of vWF. Due to the increased bleeding risk associated with AvWS, antiplatelet therapy was not initiated upon discharge.","['Gaia Filiberti', 'Alessandro Giaj Levra', 'Mauro Chiarito', 'Bernhard Reimers', 'Gianluigi Condorelli']",European heart journal.

However, limited data exist on ViV-TAVR outcomes in patients with small aortic annuli, particularly among the relatively small-statured Japanese population.
METHODS: We analyzed data from the J-TVT (Japan Transcatheter Valve Therapy) registry, which included all TAVR institutions across Japan, with data collected from July 2018, when ViV-TAVR was approved, through December 2022. A small aortic annulus was defined as an aortic annulus area of ≤314 mm², measured using preoperative computed tomography for ViV-TAVR. Prosthesis-patient mismatch (PPM) was defined as an indexed effective orifice area <0.85 cm²/m², assessed using echocardiography within 30 days after ViV-TAVR. The composite endpoint was evaluated at 30 days and 1 year.
RESULTS: Among 47 800 individuals, 1029 underwent ViV-TAVR, resulting in a final sample of 405 patients. The mean indexed effective orifice area was 0.83 cm²/m² in the small annulus group (n=225) and 0.94 cm²/m² in the nonsmall group (n=180), with PPM rates of 59.2% and 44.4%, respectively. Small annuli were independently associated with PPM (hazard ratio, 1.9 [95% CI, 1.26-2.87]; P=0.002). No differences in 30-day and 1-year outcomes were observed between groups. Among the 225 patients with small annuli, the mean indexed effective orifice area was 0.76 cm2/m2 in the balloon-expandable valve group (n=61) and 0.86 cm2/m2 in the supraannular self-expanding valve group (n=164), with PPM rates of 67.2% and 56.1%, respectively. No differences in outcomes were noted based on the type of valve implanted.
CONCLUSIONS: ViV-TAVR for small aortic annuli in Japanese patients was associated with an increased risk of PPM; however, no differences in clinical outcomes were observed according to aortic annulus size or valve type. Due to the small size of our sample, further research is required to validate these findings.","['Yusuke Oba', 'Hiraku Kumamaru', 'Satoshi Hoshide', 'Shun Kohsaka', 'Kazuo Shimamura', 'Yohei Ohno', 'Masafumi Sato', 'Hisaya Kobayashi', 'Hiroshi Funayama', 'Kenji Harada', 'Koji Kawahito', 'Kazuomi Kario']",Circulation.

40393868,Anxiety during transcatheter aortic valve replacement under local anesthesia - the ART-VR trial.,"BACKGROUND: The use of local anesthesia during transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) could result in patient discomfort. Application of immersive virtual reality (VR) during TAVR might distract the patient and enhance the overall experience.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of an immersive VR environment on periprocedural anxiety and patient discomfort, compared to standard of care in patients undergoing transfemoral (TF) TAVR under local anesthesia.
METHODS: In this single-center, randomized controlled pilot study, patients were randomized to either VR immersion during TAVR or standard of care. The intervention was a VR headset to create 3D experiences during percutaneous transfemoral TAVR. The main outcome was patient-reported procedural anxiety assessed directly after the procedure on a visual analog scale (VAS). Secondary outcomes were procedural satisfaction, pain, and change in anxiety. Personality scores were obtained at baseline to explore associations between personality types and relevant outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 75 patients (VR = 37, control = 38) were included between September 2021 and January 2023. The median age was 79 (25th-75th: 75-84) years and 32 patients (43 %) were female. Overall procedural anxiety VAS was 1.0 (0.0-3.0) and satisfaction was 9.0 (8.0-10.0). There was no difference in procedural anxiety between VR and control (VAS: 1.0 [25th-75th: 0.0-3.0] versus 1.0 [25th-75th: 0.0-3.0], p = 0.59). Procedural satisfaction, pain perception and change in anxiety were not affected by VR use.
CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing TF-TAVR under local anesthesia experienced mild procedural anxiety and high satisfaction levels. Procedural VR use did not affect procedural anxiety or pain perception.","['Sraman Chatterjee', 'Joris Ooms', 'Marjo de Ronde', 'Stefan van Gorsel', 'Antonio Maarten Mattace-Raso', 'Jeannette Goudzwaard', 'Francesco Mattace-Raso', 'Isabella Kardys', 'Rutger-Jan Nuis', 'Joost Daemen', 'Nicolas Van Mieghem']",Cardiovascular revascularization medicine : including molecular interventions,2025-05-15,10.1016/j.carrev.2025.05.015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.carrev.2025.05.015,,Paid,Anxiety during transcatheter aortic valve replacement under local anesthesia the ART VR trial CHATTERJEE 2025,Not available,"['transcatheter aortic valve', 'aortic valve replacement', 'local anesthesia', 'transcatheter aortic', 'aortic valve', 'TAVR', 'valve replacement', 'Anxiety', 'ART-VR trial', 'procedural']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['Anesthesia', 'Anxiety', 'Pain', 'TAVR', 'VR']"
40393632,REdo transcatheter aortic VALVE implantation for the management of transcatheter aortic valve failure: Design and rationale of the REVALVE study.,"BACKGROUND: The expansion of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) into younger and lower risk patients increases the likelihood of future reintervention on the valve due to bioprosthetic valve failure (BVF). However, little is known about the feasibility and outcomes of redo TAVI for BVF.
METHODS: REVALVE is an investigator-initiated, open-label, prospective registry, enrolling 300 patients undergoing redo TAVI in approximately 75 centres in 11 countries in Europe and the Middle East. The primary endpoint is REVALVE success at 30-days, adapted from the Valve Academic Research Consortium-3 (VARC-3) criteria and defined as the correct positioning of a single prosthetic heart valve into the proper anatomic location, intended performance of the valve (mean gradient <20 mmHg, peak velocity < 3.0 m/s, doppler velocity index ≥0.25, <moderate aortic regurgitation), and freedom from mortality, coronary obstruction, unplanned coronary revascularisation, and surgery or intervention related to the device. The co-primary endpoint is a composite of freedom from mortality, stroke, and re-hospitalisation for valve or procedure-related causes at 1 year. Clinical and echocardiographic follow-up will continue to 5 years. Parallel cohorts will include patients presenting with TAV BVF who are managed by surgical explantation and aortic valve replacement (AVR), or by optimal medical therapy. Sub-studies will investigate computer-simulated modelling prior to redo TAVI, post-implant coronary catheterisation, and post-procedure multi-slice computed tomography.
CONCLUSIONS: The REVALVE study is a prospective multi-centre study investigating the management of TAV failure by redo TAVI, with parallel cohorts treated by surgical AVR and optimal medical therapy.

40392447,The relationship between chronic expansion of self-expandable valves and paravalvular leakage in transcatheter aortic valve implantation.,"Paravalvular leakage (PVL) is a clinical concern in transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Although PVL has been reported to gradually decrease after self-expandable valves (SEVs) implantation, the mechanism remains unclear. Furthermore, while gradual expansion of SEVs has been documented, studies assessing their morphological changes during the chronic phase are lacking. This study aims to evaluate whether SEVs expansion occurs during follow-up and if this expansion correlates with a reduction in PVL. We included 60 patients who underwent TAVI using SEVs (Evolut PRO/PRO+/FX) from October 2020 to August 2024. Morphological findings of SEVs were assessed using computed tomography (CT), and PVL was evaluated at discharge and chronic phase post-TAVI. PVL was graded on a five-point scale via transthoracic echocardiography, and the area ratio, defined as the ratio of the basal area of the implanted SEVs to that of phantom valves measured by CT, served as the index of SEVs expansion. Chronic expansion of SEVs was observed in all cases, with the area ratio increasing from 0.59 at discharge to 0.64 at the follow-up (P < 0.05). Among the 60 patients, 44 exhibited mild or greater PVL, with 17 showing improvement at the chronic phase. The degree of valve expansion (area ratio at chronic phase/area ratio at discharge) was significantly greater in the PVL improvement group compared to the non-improvement group (1.11 vs. 1.06, P < 0.05). This study demonstrates that SEVs expand during the chronic phase after TAVI, which could contribute to the reduction of PVL.","['Yuuki Muto', 'Daisuke Isomatsu', 'Yu Sato', 'Akihiko Sato', 'Takeshi Shimizu', 'Tomofumi Misaka', 'Masayoshi Oikawa', 'Atsushi Kobayashi', 'Akiomi Yoshihisa', 'Kazuhiko Nakazato', 'Takafumi Ishida', 'Hirofumi Sekino', 'Kenji Fukushima', 'Hiroshi Ito', 'Yasuchika Takeishi']",Cardiovascular intervention and therapeutics,2025-05-20,10.1007/s12928-025-01140-7,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12928-025-01140-7,PMC8837046,Free,The relationship between chronic expansion of self expandable valves and paravalvular leakage in transcatheter aortic valve implantation MUTO 2025,pdfs\The relationship between chronic expansion of self expandable valves and paravalvular leakage in transcatheter aortic valve implantation MUT.pdf,"['transcatheter aortic valve', 'PVL', 'transcatheter heart valves', 'aortic valve', 'Evolut PRO', 'transcatheter aortic', 'aortic valve implantation', 'valve', 'valves', 'Generation Transcatheter Aortic']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['Aortic stenosis', 'Computed tomography (CT)', 'Paravalvular leakage (PVL)', 'Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI)', 'Valve expansion']"
40392421,When surgery is not an option: case report of transcatheter valve-in-valve replacement for mitral valve dysfunction.,"BACKGROUND: Heart valve diseases affect over 100 million people globally, with mitral regurgitation being the most common in developed countries. Bioprosthetic heart valves, frequently used for replacement, typically last 10-15 years before degeneration. Repeat open-heart surgery for valve replacement poses high risks, especially in older or high-risk patients. Following the success of transcatheter aortic valve replacement, transcatheter mitral valve-in-valve replacement has emerged as a less invasive alternative for patients deemed inoperable due to high surgical risks.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 69-year-old male with a history of mitral bioprosthetic valve replacement and thoracic radiotherapy who presented with shortness of breath and NYHA class 3 functional capacity. Echocardiography revealed bioprosthetic valve dysfunction with a mean gradient of 13 mmHg and pulmonary artery pressure of 70 mmHg. Given his high surgical risk (The Society of Thoracic Surgeons score 10.9%, EuroScore2 9.8%) and prior thoracic radiotherapy, a transcatheter valve-in-valve procedure was planned. A 29 mm MyVal valve was successfully implanted via a transseptal approach, resulting in complete resolution of mitral regurgitation and a mean gradient of 3 mmHg post-procedure. The patient was discharged without complications and reported improved functional capacity (NYHA class 1) at follow-up.
CONCLUSION: This case highlights the successful application of transcatheter valve-in-valve replacement for a patient with bioprosthetic mitral valve dysfunction who was at high surgical risk. The procedure, performed using a transseptal approach with a 29 mm MyVal valve, resulted in significant symptomatic and hemodynamic improvement with no complications. The patient's functional capacity improved dramatically, and follow-up imaging confirmed the effective functioning of the new valve. This case supports the viability of transcatheter techniques as a preferred alternative for inoperable patients with mitral valve dysfunction, contributing valuable insights to the growing field of minimally invasive cardiac interventions. As technology advances, transcatheter solutions are expected to offer safer and more effective treatments for bioprosthetic valve failures.","['Yakup Alsancak', 'Hasan Kan', 'Ahmet Seyfettin Gürbüz', 'Nergiz Aydın', 'Muhammed Fatih Kaleli']",The Egyptian heart journal : (EHJ) : official bulletin of the Egyptian Society of Cardiology,2025-05-20,10.1186/s43044-025-00646-y,https://doi.org/10.1186/s43044-025-00646-y,PMC12092925,Free,When surgery is not an option case report of transcatheter valve in valve replacement for mitral valve dysfunction ALSANCAK 2025,pdfs\When surgery is not an option case report of transcatheter valve in valve replacement for mitral valve dysfunction ALSANCAK 2025.pdf,"['valve', 'mitral valve', 'mitral valve dysfunction', 'valve replacement', 'bioprosthetic valve', 'mitral', 'mitral bioprosthetic valve', 'valve dysfunction', 'bioprosthetic valve replacement', 'bioprosthetic valve dysfunction']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['Bioprosthetic valve dysfunction', 'Thoracic radiotherapy', 'Transcatheter mitral valve replacement', 'Transseptal approach', 'Valve-in-valve']"

40391859,Impact of Periprocedural Statin Therapy on Mortality and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: A Meta-Analysis and Meta-Regression.,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) stands as a notable alternative to surgical valve replacement for severe aortic stenosis (AS). Despite the established benefits of statins in cardiovascular pathologies, their specific impact in patients with severe AS undergoing TAVR remains uncertain.
AIMS: Our meta-analysis aims to assess whether periprocedural statin therapy improves survival and outcomes post-TAVR, thus addressing this gap in literature.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search using various databases with relevant keywords terms was conducted to identify studies on the impact of periprocedural statin therapy on TAVR outcomes. We assessed the primary outcome of all-cause mortality alongside various secondary outcomes including stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA), myocardial infarction, acute kidney injury (AKI), 30-day mortality, in-hospital mortality, rehospitalization, cardiovascular complications, and pacemaker requirement. A random-effects model using Comprehensive Meta Analysis Software was employed to analyze the data for each outcome. Statistical significance was set at a p < 0.05.
RESULTS: Our analysis of 19 observational studies revealed that periprocedural statin therapy significantly reduces all-cause mortality following TAVR surgery (OR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.61-0.83, p < 0.001). However, the influence of statins on other outcomes remains inconclusive. These outcomes include stroke/TIA (OR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.68-1.19, p = 0.455), risk of MI (OR = 1.72, 95% CI: 0.73-4.04, p = 0.214), AKI (OR = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.75-1.31, p = 0.968), 30-day mortality (OR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.46-1.10, p = 0.126), in-hospital mortality (OR = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.13-1.38, p = 0.151), rehospitalization (OR = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.66-1.29, p = 0.645), cardiovascular complications (OR = 1.12, 95% CI: 0.91-1.37, p = 0.297), and pacemaker requirement (OR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.65-1.06, p = 0.133).
CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis indicates a potentially promising role for periprocedural statin therapy in enhancing patient outcomes post-TAVR surgery. We found a notable association between statin therapy and a reduction in all-cause mortality. However, the effects on secondary outcomes did not reach statistical significance, which warrants further investigation through larger, well-designed, randomized controlled trials.","['Aman Goyal', 'Surabhi Maheshwari', 'Yusra Mashkoor', 'Ajeet Singh', 'Faryal Rafique', 'Abu Baker Sheikh', 'Kamna Bansal']",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,2025-05-20,10.1002/ccd.31607,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.31607,,Paid,Impact of Periprocedural Statin Therapy on Mortality and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement A Meta Analysis and Meta Regression GOYAL 2025,Not available,"['Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Valve Replacement', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'Periprocedural Statin Therapy', 'Aortic Valve', 'surgical valve replacement', 'Statin Therapy', 'Periprocedural Statin', 'Statin']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['TAVI', 'TAVR', 'cardiology', 'complications', 'meta‐analysis', 'mortality', 'statins', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"

40389818,Clinical outcomes of transcatheter edge-to-edge repair in patients with acute mitral regurgitation complicated by cardiogenic shock: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Acute mitral regurgitation (AMR) complicated by cardiogenic shock (CS) is a critical cardiovascular emergency associated with high morbidity and mortality. Surgical intervention is often not feasible due to the unstable clinical status of these patients. Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) has emerged as a minimally invasive alternative, yet its safety and efficacy in this specific population remain uncertain. This study aimed to systematically evaluate and synthesize the evidence on the clinical outcomes of TEER in patients with AMR complicated by CS.
METHODS: Databases including PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were searched through March 4, 2025. Eligible studies included adult patients with AMR and CS undergoing TEER and reporting clinical outcomes. Data were synthesized using a random-effects model.
RESULTS: The pooled in-hospital mortality rate following TEER was 17.8% (95% CI: 11.2-25.2%). One-month mortality was 7.9% (95% CI: 1.1-16.8%), six-month mortality was 21.0% (95% CI: 11.2-32.7%), and one-year mortality was 36.5% (95% CI: 34.9-38.2%). Among patients with degenerative MR, the one-year mortality was 7.9% (95% CI: 0.8-19.0%), while for functional MR it was 9.4% (95% CI: 1.3-21.5%). Postprocedural MR reduction to ≤ grade 2 was achieved in 86.2% of patients (95% CI: 70.7-97.3%). The intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) application rate was 57.9% (95% CI: 24.2%-88.5%). Compared to usual care, TEER significantly reduced in-hospital mortality (OR = 0.64; 95% CI: 0.51-0.81; P < 0.01). However, no significant reduction was found in rehospitalization risk (OR = 0.65; 95% CI: 0.14-3.03; P = 0.59).
CONCLUSION: TEER appears to be a promising therapeutic option for patients with AMR complicated by CS. Compared to usual care, it is associated with significantly lower in-hospital mortality.

40388768,Heyde syndrome: Experiences with the use of semiautomatic vWF multimer analysis for diagnosis and TAVI for treatment - case report.,"RATIONALE: Aortic stenosis (AS) is currently the most frequent valve disorder. In addition, the angiodysplasias are the most common vascular malformations of the gastrointestinal tract. Heyde syndrome (HS) is a rare disease which links these 2 pathological conditions.
PATIENT CONCERNS: Currently, there are no clearly defined guidelines for the confirmation of HS diagnosis and for timing of aortic valve replacement in patients with confirmed HS, despite the fact that HS is connected with increased mortality and the need for numerous rehospitalizations and multiple blood transfusions. Therefore, the aim of this study was to report (our) first experiences with novel diagnostic method for acquired von Willebrand (vW) syndrome and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for treatment of HS.
DIAGNOSES: We report a case of a 68-year-old man who was diagnosed with HS with the use of semiautomatic vW factor multimer analysis.
INTERVENTIONS: A successful TAVR was used for treatment of AS.
OUTCOMES: After the interventional treatment of AS, the patient did not have a recurrence of the anemic syndrome.
LESSONS: This is a unique case of a patient with HS in whom semiautomatic vW factor multimer analysis was used for diagnosis of acquired vW syndrome together with TAVR procedure for HS treatment.","['Boris Focko', 'Zuzana Miertová', 'Ingrid Škorňová', 'Martin Hudec', 'Martin Jozef Péč', 'Jakub Jurica', 'Marek Cingel', 'Tomáš Bolek', 'Juraj Sokol', 'Petra Poliačiková', 'Marián Mokáň', 'Matej Samoš']",Medicine,2025-05-16,10.1097/MD.0000000000042486,https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000042486,PMC12091634,Free,Heyde syndrome Experiences with the use of semiautomatic vWF multimer analysis for diagnosis and TAVI for treatment case report FOCKO 2025,pdfs\Heyde syndrome Experiences with the use of semiautomatic vWF multimer analysis for diagnosis and TAVI for treatment case report FOCKO 2025.p.pdf,"['acquired von Willebrand', 'aortic valve', 'aortic valve replacement', 'von Willebrand syndrome', 'von Willebrand', 'multimer analysis', 'vWF multimer analysis', 'University Hospital Martin', 'factor multimer analysis', 'transcatheter aortic valve']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['Heyde syndrome', 'acquired von Willebrand syndrome', 'aortic stenosis', 'semiautomatic von Willebrand factor multimer analysis']"
40388090,Advances in Clinical Cardiology 2024: A Summary of Key Clinical Trials.,"INTRODUCTION: In 2024, numerous key clinical trials in the field of clinical cardiology have been published or presented at major international conferences. This review seeks to collate and summarise these trials and reflect on their clinical context.
METHODS: The authors evaluated all clinical trials presented at major cardiology conferences during 2024 with a focus on clinical trials which would influence and/or change current clinical practice. We reviewed clinical trials presented at all major international conferences including the American College of Cardiology (ACC), European Association for Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions (EuroPCR), European Society of Cardiology (ESC), Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics (TCT), American Heart Association (AHA), European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA), Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI), TVT-The Heart Summit (TVT) and Cardiovascular Research Technologies (CRT). Trials considered to have highest impact and/or broad relevance across the field of clinical cardiology, with a high likelihood to change or impact upon clinical practice were included.
RESULTS: Over 90 key cardiology clinical trials were identified across the spectrum of clinical cardiology. Important updates in percutaneous coronary intervention were reviewed including new ESC guidance and several key trials in the field of coronary physiology (FAVOR III), drug-coated balloons (REGCAGE-FREE, AGENT-IDE), shock, and acute coronary syndromes (SENIOR-RITA, DanGer-Shock). Structural trials included major updates in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) from EARLY-TAVR, TAVR-UNLOAD and NOTION 3, as well as seminal trials in tricuspid (TRISCEND II) and mitral intervention (MATTERHORN). Key updates in preventative cardiology included new data in lipoprotein (a) pharmacotherapy, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol reduction and hypertension management (BPROAD, BedMed, KRAKEN), as well as several key trials in heart failure (SUMMIT, FINEARTS) hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (SEQUOIA-HCM) and cardiac amyloid (HELIOS-B).
CONCLUSION: The review presents a concise summary of the key clinical cardiology trials published or presented during the past year and should be of interest to clinicians and researchers in the field of cardiology.","['Patrick Savage', 'Michael Campbell', 'Meadhbh Hogg', 'Daniel McElhatton', 'Ian Menown']",Advances in therapy,2025-05-19,10.1007/s12325-025-03220-9,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12325-025-03220-9,PMC11213809,Free,Advances in Clinical Cardiology 2024 A Summary of Key Clinical Trials SAVAGE 2025,pdfs\Advances in Clinical Cardiology 2024 A Summary of Key Clinical Trials SAVAGE 2025.pdf,"['Clinical Trials', 'Key Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Cardiology', 'Cardiology', 'clinical trials presented', 'Clinical', 'cardiology clinical trials', 'clinical cardiology trials', 'Trials', 'Heart Rhythm Association']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['Acute coronary syndromes', 'Cardiology', 'Clinical trials', 'Electrophysiology', 'Heart failure', 'Intervention', 'Prevention', 'Structural']"
40387044,Totally endoscopic aortic valve replacement after open surgical and subsequent transcatheter aortic valve replacement.,"Transcatheter aortic valve replacement is increasingly being offered to younger and lower risk patients, including patients with previous surgical aortic valve replacement. The long-term outcome of valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve replacement after surgical valve replacement remains uncertain. We present the case of a fully thoracoscopic redo aortic valve replacement for symptomatic valve-in-valve stenosis after previous open surgical aortic valve replacement and secondary valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve replacement. This procedure has proven to be difficult and high risk, in part due to the redo nature of the operation and the extensive neo- endothelialization over the transcatheter aortic valve replacement stent frame. This article demonstrates the feasibility of a minimally invasive approach for transcatheter aortic valve replacement and bioprosthetic valve explant while simultaneously highlighting the essential role of the heart team in selecting the correct treatment strategy for patients with bioprosthetic valve degeneration.","['Silke Van Genechten', 'William Hillen', 'Jade Claessens', 'Loren Packlé', 'Hanne Oosterbos', 'Samuel Heuts', 'Alaaddin Yilmaz']",Multimedia manual of cardiothoracic surgery : MMCTS,2025-05-19,10.1510/mmcts.2024.126,https://doi.org/10.1510/mmcts.2024.126,,Paid,Totally endoscopic aortic valve replacement after open surgical and subsequent transcatheter aortic valve replacement GENECHTEN 2025,Not available,"['aortic valve replacement', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'aortic valve', 'valve replacement', 'surgical aortic valve', 'Totally endoscopic aortic', 'endoscopic aortic valve', 'transcatheter aortic', 'valve', 'subsequent transcatheter aortic']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['Aortic valve replacement', 'Endoscopic surgery', 'Redo cardiac surgery']"
40384343,Continuation Versus Interruption of Oral Anticoagulation During TAVI: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Oral Anticoagulation Management in TAVI.,"Patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) often require long-term oral anticoagulation (OAC), but it is unclear whether to continue or interrupt OAC during the procedure. This meta-analysis compares clinical outcomes of continuing versus interrupting OAC during TAVI. PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central databases were searched from inception to September 2024 for studies comparing continuation versus interruption of OAC in patients undergoing TAVI with an indication for OAC, including vitamin K antagonists and direct oral anticoagulants. Risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were pooled using a random-effects model. Sensitivity analysis was performed using the Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman method. Three studies were included, one randomized controlled trial and two cohort studies, with 2773 patients, of whom 1314 (47.4%) continued OAC during TAVI. At a 30-day follow-up after TAVI, there were no significant differences between groups in all-cause mortality (RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.45-1.20; p = 0.22), any bleeding (RR 1.08; 95% CI 0.81-1.43; p = 0.60), and major bleeding (RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.67-1.21; p = 0.48). However, the continued OAC group was associated with a lower stroke rate (RR 0.65; 95% CI 0.42-1.01; p = 0.053), also attested after a sensitivity analysis (RR 0.65; 95% CI 0.47-0.90; p < 0.03). In patients with an indication for OAC undergoing TAVI, uninterrupted anticoagulation is associated with similar thrombotic and hemorrhagic outcomes compared to interrupted OAC. Stroke risk was lower in the continued OAC group, with a significant reduction, as demonstrated in sensitivity analysis.","['Jefferson Manoel Borges Martins', 'Rafael Dos Santos Borges', 'Giovanni Gosch Berton', 'Paula Larissa Ferreira Vieira', 'Pedro Antônio Machado Gomes de Sousa', 'Ana Livia Chaves Vieira', 'Christian Ken Fukunaga', 'Vanessa Karlinski Vizentin', 'Esthefani Monique Rodrigues Macedo', 'Camila Mota Guida']",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,2025-05-19,10.1002/ccd.31599,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.31599,,Paid,Continuation Versus Interruption of Oral Anticoagulation During TAVI A Systematic Review and Meta Analysis Oral Anticoagulation Management in TAVI MARTINS 2025,Not available,"['Oral Anticoagulation Management', 'Systematic Review', 'Oral Anticoagulation', 'Anticoagulation Management', 'Meta-Analysis Oral Anticoagulation', 'Continuation Versus Interruption', 'OAC', 'TAVI', 'long-term oral anticoagulation', 'OAC undergoing TAVI']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['direct oral anticoagulants', 'perioperative care', 'stroke', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement', 'treatment interruption', 'vitamin K antagonists']"
40383183,The safety and feasibility of same day discharge for patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Next day discharge (NDD) after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has been shown to be safe in appropriately selected patients and has since been implemented into clinical practice. As the demand for TAVR grows, improving its accessibility is crucial. Several studies have trialled same day discharge (SDD) after TAVR, but a review has not been performed.
METHODS: Five databases were searched. Baseline demographics, study characteristics and the assessment criteria used to determine eligibility for SDD were extracted and compared. Proportional meta-analysis was used to compare post-TAVI outcomes between SDD and NDD patients.
RESULTS: Six studies were included from 1734 screened articles. Of 3519 patients, 318 (9.0%) underwent SDD (mean age 78.2 ± 8.7 years; 59.3% male). Balloon-expanding valves were used in 91.6% of cases, and self-expanding valves in the remaining 8.4%. Patients that underwent SDD experienced lower rates of mortality (OR 0.104, 95% CI: 0.015 - 0.998), all-cause readmission (OR 0.194, 95% CI 0.052 - 0.717), cardiovascular readmissions (OR 0.155, 95% CI 0.026 - 0.971), and new pacemaker requirement (OR 0.167, 95% 0.028 - 0.995) at 30 days after TAVR, compared to patients that underwent NDD. There was no difference in rates of stroke (OR 0.407, 95% CI: 0.015 - 16.694) or major vascular complications (0.0% vs 0.0%).
CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence supports the safety and feasibility of SDD after elective, transfemoral TAVR in appropriately selected patients. Heterogeneity between eligibility criteria used to select patients for SDD, especially related to conduction disease, poses a barrier to implementation. Further research on self-expanding valves is needed.","['Princess Neila Litkouhi', 'Karan Rao', 'Alexandra Baer', 'Peter S Hansen', 'Ravinay Bhindi']",The Canadian journal of cardiology,2025-05-16,10.1016/j.cjca.2025.05.007,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2025.05.007,,Paid,The safety and feasibility of same day discharge for patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement a systematic review and meta analysis LITKOUHI 2025,Not available,"['aortic valve replacement', 'undergoing transcatheter aortic', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'transcatheter aortic', 'day discharge', 'SDD', 'TAVR', 'patients undergoing transcatheter', 'valve replacement', 'patients']",2025-05-27,Pending,[]

40382742,Transcatheter Versus Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement in Patients with Polyvascular Disease.,"INTRODUCTION: There is a paucity of data regarding the trends and comparative outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) versus surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) among patients with polyvascular disease (PVD).
METHODS: The Nationwide Readmissions Database (2016-2020) was queried for patients undergoing AVR. Propensity score matching was used to compare the outcomes of TAVR versus SAVR among patients with PVD, and for comparing TAVR among those with versus without PVD. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality.
RESULTS: The final cohort included 545,409 hospitalizations for AVR. During the study years, there was an increase in the utilization of TAVR versus SAVR among patients with PVD. Patients with PVD undergoing TAVR were older and more likely to be women compared with patients with PVD undergoing SAVR. Compared with SAVR, patients with PVD undergoing TAVR had lower odds of in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.26; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19-0.35), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, and major bleeding, but higher odds of pacemaker and non-elective 90-day readmissions (aOR 1.13; 95% CI 1.01-1.26). TAVR among patients with versus without PVD showed similar in-hospital mortality (aOR 1.10; 95% CI 0.94-1.20), while there were higher odds of AMI, ischemic stroke, and vascular complications after TAVR in patients with PVD. A higher burden of atherosclerotic vascular beds conferred higher mortality with SAVR more than with TAVR, while a higher burden of atherosclerotic vascular beds conferred a higher risk of ischemic stroke and readmissions after both TAVR and SAVR.
CONCLUSIONS: Nationwide data demonstrated that patients with PVD who undergo TAVR were associated with lower in-hospital mortality and major cardiovascular complications compared with those who undergo SAVR. Patients with PVD have similar mortality to those with no PVD undergoing TAVR, but were associated with a higher risk for complications and readmission.
The Nationwide Readmissions Database (2016–2020) was queried for patients undergoing aortic valve replacement AVR (n = 545,409).

Patients with polyvascular disease undergoing TAVR had lower odds of in-hospital mortality, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, and major bleeding compared with SAVR, but higher odds of pacemaker and non-elective 90-day readmissions. TAVR among patients with versus without polyvascular disease showed similar in-hospital mortality, while there were higher odds of myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and vascular complications after TAVR in patients with polyvascular disease.

40379374,Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Severe Horizontal Heart With Acute Aortic Angulation.,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become a first-line treatment for elderly patients with severe aortic stenosis since its first successful implementation in 2002. However, performing TAVR in patients with extreme horizontal heart orientation and acute aortic angulation is technically challenging and carries higher procedural risks.
CASE SUMMARY: This case report describes a patient with severe aortic stenosis complicated by an extreme horizontal heart position and acute aortic angulation. Under the support of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), femoral artery long sheaths, and snare traction, the TAVR procedure was successfully completed.
DISCUSSION: The success of this case provides valuable insights for managing complex TAVR procedures.
TAKE-HOME MESSAGES: CPB provides critical hemodynamic support during TAVR in patients with extreme horizontal cardiac orientation, effectively preventing intraoperative circulatory collapse.

40376780,Aortic Valve Calcium Score Quantification by Contrast Cardiac CT: Correlations With Echocardiography and Optimal Thresholds.,"BACKGROUND: Aortic valve calcium score (AVCa) measured on noncontrast computed tomography (CT) is well-established for grading aortic stenosis (AS) severity. However, thresholds for AVCa measured on contrast CT remain uncertain. We evaluated correlations, associated factors, and severity thresholds of AVCa measured on contrast CT against transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) measures of AS.
METHODS: Patients with native AS undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement evaluation from 2019 to 2020 who underwent TTE and contrast-enhanced CT were retrospectively studied (n=1035, age 79±9 years, 429 (41.5%) women, 906 (87.5%) severe and 129 (12.5%) moderate AS by TTE). AVCa was measured using the modified Agatston method with the minimum threshold of 4 SD above the mean ascending aorta blood pool Hounsfield units. Receiver-operating characteristics analysis and Youden index were used to define sex-specific optimal AVCa thresholds for identifying severe AS defined by TTE (aortic valve area by continuity equation ≤1.0 cm2) in the derivation cohort and assessed when applied to the validation cohort.
RESULTS: Mean aortic valve area on TTE was 0.79±0.21 cm2, while mean AVCa score, volume, and mass were 2152±1102 modified AU, 1853±1592 mm3, and 673±485 mg, respectively. Multivariable linear regression identified women to be associated with lower AVCa (β-coefficient, -358), while chronic kidney disease was associated with a higher AVCa (β-coefficient, 171). Optimal severe AS thresholds of ≥1840 modified AU for men and ≥1430 modified AU for women were determined, with area under curve (95% CIs) and sensitivities/specificities of 0.809 (0.749-0.869, 71.3%, 82.2%) for men and 0.822 (0.751-0.892), 73.4%/78.9% for women in the derivation cohort, and 0.830 (0.786-0.875), 75.9%/87.5% for men and 0.780 (0.670-0.890), 77.5%/71.4% for women in the validation cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: AVCa by contrast CT is a useful tool for identifying severe AS by TTE, with sex-specific thresholds for severe AS identified. Further studies are necessary to externally validate our findings and evaluate their prognostic significance.","['Tiffany Dong', 'Elio Haroun', 'Aro Daniela Arockiam', 'Rishabh Khurana', 'Joseph El Dahdah', 'Ankit Agrawal', 'Yuichiro Okushi', 'David Moros', 'Kashyap Bodi', 'Ushasi Saraswati', 'Mohammad Alamer', 'Abdelrahman Abushouk', 'Agam Bansal', 'Serge Harb', 'Zoran Popovic', 'Leonardo Rodriguez', 'Rishi Puri', 'Grant Reed', 'Amar Krishnaswamy', 'Brian Griffin', 'Samir Kapadia', 'Tom Kai Ming Wang']",Circulation.

40375767,Leaflet modification techniques to mitigate coronary obstruction risk during transcatheter aortic valve implantation.,"Coronary obstruction is a rare but serious complication during transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), particularly in valve-in-valve procedures, which is associated with high mortality. This review explores various leaflet modification techniques designed to mitigate this risk. Among the most studied methods is Bioprosthetic or native Aortic Scallop Intentional Laceration to prevent Iatrogenic Coronary Artery obstruction (BASILICA), which uses transcatheter electrosurgery to lacerate the aortic valve leaflet and maintain coronary perfusion. Other promising techniques include ShortCut, a mechanical leaflet splitting device, and Undermining Iatrogenic Coronary Obstruction with Radiofrequency Needle (UNICORN), which utilises radiofrequency energy to achieve leaflet laceration. These approaches differ in their procedural complexity, equipment requirements, and clinical outcomes.

40375761,Long-term structural valve deterioration after TAVI: insights from the EORP ESC Valve Durability TAVI Registry.,"BACKGROUND: Valve durability is a key consideration as the patient population eligible for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) expands to include lower-risk and younger individuals who are expected to live many years after the procedure.
AIMS: This registry aimed to assess the incidence of long-term structural valve deterioration (SVD) beyond 5 years post-TAVI.
METHODS: Consecutive living patients who underwent TAVI up until 2014 using any commercially available transcatheter heart valve (THV) at 22 participant centres were enrolled in the European Valve Durability TAVI Registry. All patients underwent comprehensive echocardiographic assessments (61% were evaluated independently by a central core laboratory) within 6 months of enrolment and at least 5 years post-TAVI; SVD was defined according to Valve Academic Research Consortium 3 definitions.
RESULTS: A total of 597 patients (aged 79.6±7.1 years at the time of TAVI; 47.2% male, mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons score 5.0%) were included. At a median of 6.1 years of follow-up (interquartile range 5.2-7.3 years), the crude incidence of moderate/severe SVD was 9.5% (n=57; moderate: 6.2%, n=37; severe: 3.4%, n=20). Predictors of SVD identified by Cox regression analysis were use of an intra-annular THV (hazard ratio [HR] 38.44, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 10.8-136.3; p<0.001), a small THV size (HR 4.82, 95% CI: 2.42-9.60; p<0.001) and moderate/severe postprocedural paravalvular leak (HR 3.64, 95% CI: 1.59-8.32; p=0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of moderate/severe SVD during long-term follow-up after TAVI is low, with severe SVD being even rarer than moderate SVD. SVD occurs more frequently in patients treated with older-generation intra-annular valves and in those with small-sized THVs.","['Cristina Giannini', 'Davide Capodanno', 'Gabor G Toth', 'Stephan Windecker', 'Stefanie Schüpke', 'Daniel J Blackman', 'Stéphane Noble', 'Hélène Eltchaninoff', 'Claudia Fiorina', 'Alaide Chieffo', 'Antonio L Bartorelli', 'Albrecht Schmidt', 'Ole De Backer', 'Martine Gilard', 'Elizabeth Curtis', ""Guillaume L'Official"", 'Erwan Donal', 'Cécile Laroche', 'Bernard Prendergast', 'Anna Sonia Petronio', 'On Behalf The European Valve Durability Tavi Registry Investigators']",EuroIntervention : journal of EuroPCR in collaboration with the Working Group on Interventional Cardiology of the European Society of Cardiology,2025-05-16,10.4244/EIJ-D-24-00662,https://doi.org/10.4244/EIJ-D-24-00662,PMC12063547,Paid,Long term structural valve deterioration after TAVI insights from the EORP ESC Valve Durability TAVI Registry GIANNINI 2025,Not downloaded,"['EORP ESC Valve', 'ESC Valve Durability', 'EORP ESC', 'Durability TAVI Registry', 'Valve Durability TAVI', 'Valve Durability', 'Durability TAVI', 'European Valve Durability', 'ESC Valve', 'structural valve deterioration']",2025-05-27,Pending,[]
40372482,Mid- to long-term outcomes of covered balloon-expandable stent implantation for the management of vascular injuries in patients undergoing transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation: the BE-SAFE Registry : for the RECOVER (REsults after percutaneous interventions with COVERed stents) Investigators.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Vascular complications occur in a non-negligible proportion of transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation (Tf-TAVI) procedures. There is only limited evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of covered balloon-expandable (CBE) stents in the management of Tf-TAVI related vascular complications. We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of CBE stent implantation to treat access-related vascular complications in patients undergoing Tf-TAVI.
METHODS: The present retrospective analysis included patients undergoing CBE stent implantation following Tf-TAVI from April 2012 to January 2023 at our centre. The primary endpoint was technical success defined as successful device delivery and implantation at the intended location with angiographic confirmation of vessel patency and absence of residual bleeding. Clinical outcomes and color Doppler ultrasonography findings were evaluated at discharge, 30 days and longest available follow-up.
RESULTS: Among 3331 Tf-TAVI procedures, 93 patients (2.8%) required covered stent implantation for the treatment of access related vascular complications. Technical success was achieved in 92 patients (98.9%). BeGraft and Atrium Advanta V12 CBE stents were implanted in 76 (81.7%) and 17 (18.3%) patients, respectively. Median clinical follow-up was 455 [304; 798] days, with both in-hospital and 30-days mortality equaling 4.3% and 1-year mortality 15.1%. Pre-discharge Doppler ultrasonography was performed in 98.9% patients, with normal findings in 79.8% and minor findings (such as pseudoaneurysm, non-flow-limiting dissection, arterio-venous fistula) in the remaining patients. Clinical follow-up was available in 96.2% patients; no cases of new-onset claudication, need for repeat surgical or transcatheter vascular interventions were recorded. Follow-up Doppler ultrasonography (54.4% patients) showed persistent patency and no signs of stent failure in all patients.
CONCLUSIONS: CBE stent implantation for the treatment of access site related vascular complications after Tf-TAVI is associated with excellent technical success rates, optimal short- to mid-term patency rates as well as satisfactory long-term clinical outcomes.","['Hector A Alvarez-Covarrubias', 'Martin Jurisic', 'Finn Syryca', 'Charlotte Duesmann', 'Costanza Pellegrini', 'Tobias Rheude', 'N Patrick Mayr', 'Niklas Altaner', 'Moritz Kühlein', 'Tobias Lenz', 'Edna Blum', 'Yousuke Taniguchi', 'Gjin Ndrepepa', 'Christian Thilo', 'Heribert Schunkert', 'Adnan Kastrati', 'Sebastian Kufner', 'Salvatore Cassese', 'Michael Joner', 'Erion Xhepa']",Clinical research in cardiology : official journal of the German Cardiac Society,2025-05-15,10.1007/s00392-025-02651-2,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00392-025-02651-2,PMC7578005,Paid,Mid to long term outcomes of covered balloon expandable stent implantation for the management of vascular injuries in patients undergoing transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation the BE SAFE Registry for the RECOVER REsults after percutaneous interventions with COVERed stents Investigators ALVAREZ-COVARRUBIAS 2025,Not downloaded,"['CBE stent implantation', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'BE-SAFE Registry', 'transfemoral transcatheter aortic', 'aortic valve implantation', 'Vascular complications', 'CBE stent', 'stent implantation', 'related vascular complications', 'patients']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['Covered balloon-expandable stent', 'Transcatheter aortic valve implantation', 'Transfemoral access', 'Vascular complication']"
40371620,Rationale and Design of the REPEAT Trial: A Multicenter Randomized Trial Comparing Redo Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement to Valve-in-Valve Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.,"BACKGROUND: Redo surgical aortic valve replacement (rSAVR) has for long been the therapeutic reference standard for degenerated surgical aortic bioprostheses. Valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve replacement (ViV-TAVR) has emerged as an alternative for patients at high surgical risk due to its lower invasiveness. The long-term clinical efficacy of ViV-TAVR in patients at low to intermediate surgical risk remains unknown.
METHODS AND RESULTS: To compare clinical outcomes of redo surgical aortic valve replacement versus ViV-TAVR in low- to intermediate-risk patients with degenerated surgical aortic bioprostheses. REPEAT (Repeat Intervention for Deteriorated Surgical Bioprosthetic Aortic Valves) is an investigator-initiated, international, multicenter, randomized, parallel, open-label trial. A total of 890 patients aged <75 years with a failed surgical aortic bioprosthesis due to structural valve degeneration and low to intermediate surgical risk (ie, Society of Thoracic Surgeons predicted risk of death of <8%) will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either redo surgical aortic valve replacement or ViV-TAVR. The primary end point of REPEAT is a composite of all-cause death, stroke (including both disabling and nondisabling), myocardial infarction, and rehospitalization for heart failure or aortic valve reintervention at 5 years, based on Valve Academic Research Consortium-3 definitions. Secondary end points include each of the individual components of the primary composite end point, Valve Academic Research Consortium-3-based conduction disturbances and arrhythmia, Valve Academic Research Consortium-3-based wound and bleeding complications, functional status (ie, 6-minute walk test, Kansas City Cardiomyopathy questionnaire), and treatment costs.
CONCLUSIONS: The REPEAT trial has been designed to test the hypothesis that redo surgical aortic valve replacement is superior to ViV-TAVR regarding clinical outcomes at 5 years in patients with degenerated surgical aortic bioprostheses and low to intermediate surgical risk.","['Matthias Raschpichler', 'Suzanne de Waha', 'Stefan Blankenberg', 'Marcio A Diniz', 'Emilia Bagiella', 'Annetine C Gelijns', 'Vinicius F Calsavara', 'Aakriti Gupta', 'Niklas Schofer', 'Tsuyoshi Kaneko', 'Mohamed Abdel-Wahab', 'Holger Thiele', 'Raj Makkar', 'Michael A Borger']",Journal of the American Heart Association,2025-05-20,10.1161/JAHA.125.040954,https://doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.125.040954,,Paid,Rationale and Design of the REPEAT Trial A Multicenter Randomized Trial Comparing Redo Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement to Valve in Valve Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement RASCHPICHLER 2025,Not available,"['Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Surgical Aortic Valve', 'Redo Surgical Aortic', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Aortic Valve', 'Surgical Aortic', 'Comparing Redo Surgical', 'Valve Academic Research', 'Valve Replacement', 'Trial Comparing Redo']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['aortic stenosis', 'failed surgical aortic bioprosthesis', 'redo surgical aortic valve replacement', 'structural valve deterioration', 'valve‐in‐valve transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"
40371611,Comparing Major Gastrointestinal Bleeding in Patients Receiving Edoxaban Versus Warfarin After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: Results From the Randomized ENVISAGE-TAVI AF Trial.,"BACKGROUND: Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants are recommended over vitamin K antagonists in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF). However, the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding may be higher with non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants versus vitamin K antagonists. Patients after successful transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) who are elderly and frail have worse outcomes with major gastrointestinal bleeding (MGIB), including death. This study evaluated incidence, predictors, and impact of MGIB among patients with AF after successful TAVR.
METHODS: This on-treatment analysis of ENVISAGE-TAVI AF (Edoxaban Compared to Standard Care After Heart Valve Replacement Using a Catheter in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation) included patients who received ≥1 dose of the study drug. Demographic, clinical, and procedural characteristics were compared between patients with versus without an MGIB event. Cox multivariable regression analysis identified predictors of MGIB.
RESULTS: Of 1377 patients in this analysis, 83 (6.0%) experienced MGIB, with 56 (67.5%) of these patients receiving edoxaban. Patients with versus without MGIB were more likely to have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention ≤30 days before TAVR (9.6% versus 4.2%; P=0.03), a higher ejection fraction (mean±SD, 58.0±10.4 versus 55.3±11.5; P=0.04), and carotid artery disease (13.3% versus 6.6%; P=0.04). Edoxaban without dose adjustment versus vitamin K antagonist use (P=0.003), smoking (P=0.01), low hemoglobin levels (P<0.0001), and percutaneous coronary intervention ≤30 days before TAVR (P=0.01) emerged as predictors of MGIB.
CONCLUSIONS: In this ENVISAGE-TAVI AF subanalysis, MGIB occurred in 6.0% of patients with prevalent or incident AF undergoing TAVR, and those receiving edoxaban versus vitamin K antagonists had a higher risk of MGIB. A priori identification of risk factors for MGIB may help optimize outcomes for patients with AF undergoing TAVR.

40371608,Sex-Associated Disparities in Surgical and Percutaneous Management of Aortic Stenosis With Severe Features: Retrospective Analysis From the National Readmission Database.,"BACKGROUND: Referral for valve intervention for severe aortic stenosis (AS) may exhibit sex-associated disparities independent of the growth of transcatheter interventions. This study aimed to determine whether there were sex-associated differences in the use of aortic valve replacement (AVR), either surgical or transcatheter, in patients with aortic stenosis and severe features from a national cohort of patients.
METHODS: Using the National Readmission Database, all patients with an index diagnosis of AS between January 2015 and December 2019 were included and stratified by their 90-day readmission status and sex. AS with severe features was defined as the combination of primary- or secondary-coded diagnosis of AS in combination with heart failure, syncope, angina pectoris, cardiac arrest, or cardiogenic shock. A 1:1 nested case-control matching was performed to account for competing risk. The main investigated outcome was the sex-associated rate of AVR in the 90 days after index hospitalization.
RESULTS: A total of 31 712 matched weighted discharges were included in the analysis, 16 597 men (52.3%) and 15 116 women (47.7%). At 90 days, the rate of AVR was significantly lower in women (45.7% versus 53.6%, P<0.001) with significant difference for both surgical (P<0.001) and transcatheter (P=0.010) interventions. After multivariable adjustment, these differences persisted with women significantly less likely to receive AVR (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.67 [95% CI, 0.63-0.71], P<0.001), either surgical AVR (aOR, 0.48 [95% CI, 0.43-0.54], P<0.001) or transcatheter aortic valve implantation (aOR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.75-0.84], P<0.001).

40371597,Anatomical and Functional Predictors of Permanent Pacemaker Implantation After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.,"BACKGROUND: High-degree atrioventricular block with the need for permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation represents a frequent complication after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Extension of indication for TAVI toward subjects with lower surgical risk requires reduction of the likelihood for the need for PPM implantation. The aim of the current analysis was to identify predictors of the need for PPM implantation after TAVI.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In a cohort of 1500 consecutive patients without a PPM undergoing transfemoral TAVI, clinical and procedural characteristics as well as parameters derived from cardiac computed tomography, such as membranous septal length and calcium volumes of the aortic valve cusps and the left ventricular outflow tract were assessed. Median calcium volume of the aortic valve was 552 mm3 (interquartile range [IQR]: 340-811 mm3) in the group of subjects requiring a PPM, which was higher than in the group of subjects not requiring PPM implantation (455 mm3 [IQR: 245-723 mm3], Padj=0.001). The same was true for calcification of the noncoronary cusp (Padj=0.027), left coronary cusp (Padj=0.033), and right coronary cusp (Padj=0.006). In multivariable analysis, calcium volume of the noncoronary cusp (P=0.039; odds ratio [OR], 1.089 per 100 mm3), preexisting complete right bundle-branch block (P<0.001; OR, 9.402), and implantation of a self-expandable prosthesis (P<0.001; OR, 1.856) were significantly associated with PPM implantation after TAVI.
CONCLUSIONS: The current analysis offers a detailed examination of predictors for the need for PPM implantation after TAVI. Our results may contribute to improved risk stratification on the need for PPM implantation after TAVI.","['Susanne Jung', 'Markus Kondruweit', 'Mohamed Marwan', 'Stephan Achenbach']",Journal of the American Heart Association,2025-05-20,10.1161/JAHA.124.039020,https://doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.124.039020,,Paid,Anatomical and Functional Predictors of Permanent Pacemaker Implantation After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation JUNG 2025,Not available,"['PPM implantation', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Permanent Pacemaker Implantation', 'Aortic Valve Implantation', 'Anatomical and Functional', 'Permanent Pacemaker', 'PPM', 'Aortic Valve', 'Implantation', 'Transcatheter Aortic']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['atrioventricular block', 'cardiac computed tomography', 'permanent pacemaker', 'transcatheter aortic valve implantation']"
40371590,A Two-Step Risk Score for Prediction of Permanent Pacemaker Implantation After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.,"BACKGROUND: The need for postoperative permanent pacemaker implantation (PPMI) remains one of the most frequent complications after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). This study aimed to develop a novel, 2-step risk score to predict PPMI probability after TAVI and implement it into a user-friendly website. Our risk score addresses the data gap on current prosthesis generations and provides a new, clinically motivated approach to calculating PPMI risk.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Between January 2019 and December 2020, 1039 patients underwent TAVI at our institution. We retrospectively evaluated clinical, electrocardiographic, echocardiographic, computed tomographic, and periprocedural data. Patients with prior PPMI were excluded. We developed a prediction model for PPMI occurrence, using 55 patient and procedural characteristics. With exclusion criteria applied, 836 patients (mean age 80.3±9.1 years; 50.6% female) were included. Of these, 149 (17.8%) required PPMI within 30 days after TAVI. Fourteen preprocedural parameters, including preexisting right bundle-branch block, atrioventricular block, left bundle-branch block, bradycardia, interventricular septum thickness, New York Heart Association class, and aortic annulus perimeter, were identified as PPMI risk factors and used to calculate the baseline risk in the first step of the TAVI PACER score. The second step includes intraprocedural variables to demonstrate how PPMI risk can vary based on valve type and implantation depth. The TAVI PACER score predicts PPMI with a sensitivity of 76% and specificity of 72% (area under the curve=0.8).
CONCLUSIONS: The TAVI PACER score provides a novel tool for daily clinical practice, predicting individual PPMI risk after TAVI based on various patient and procedural characteristics.","['Alexandra Janiszewski', 'Julia Lueg', 'Daniel Schulze', 'Benjamin Juri', 'Louis Morell', 'Maria Hajduczenia', 'Pierre Hennig', 'Aslihan Erbay', 'Alexander Lembcke', 'Stefan Niehues', 'Ulf Landmesser', 'Karl Stangl', 'David Leistner', 'Verena Tscholl', 'Henryk Dreger']",Journal of the American Heart Association,2025-05-20,10.1161/JAHA.124.039036,https://doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.124.039036,,Paid,A Two Step Risk Score for Prediction of Permanent Pacemaker Implantation After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation JANISZEWSKI 2025,Not available,"['Permanent Pacemaker Implantation', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Aortic Valve Implantation', 'Permanent Pacemaker', 'TAVI PACER score', 'Pacemaker Implantation', 'postoperative permanent pacemaker', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'Valve Implantation', 'PPMI']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['TAVI', 'aortic valve', 'pacemaker', 'risk score']"
40370817,Valve type and post-dilation impact on transprosthetic gradients in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve-in-valve procedure.,"AIMS: Valve-in-Valve transcatheter aortic valve replacement (ViV-TAVR) is an appealing treatment option for patients with degenerated aortic bioprosthetic valves. However, higher post-procedural transprosthetic gradients are more common after ViV-TAVR than after TAVR for native aortic valve stenosis. We sought to evaluate the impact of type of implanted valve and balloon post-dilation on echocardiographic results and mortality in ViV-TAVR patients.
METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred and eleven consecutive patients were enrolled. A balloon-expandable valve, a self-expandable valve without balloon post-dilation, and a self-expandable valve with balloon post-dilation were performed in 35 (Group 1), 39 (Group 2), and 37 (Group 3) patients, respectively. All patients underwent comprehensive transthoracic echocardiography at baseline, discharge, and 6-12 months follow-up. Successful ViV-TAVR was performed in 110 patients (99%). Baseline transprosthetic gradients, left ventricular volumes, ejection fraction, and pulmonary artery systolic pressure were similar among groups. All groups experienced a significant reduction in post-procedural gradients at discharge and during the 6-12 months follow-up compared with baseline. At discharge, the lowest mean gradient was observed in Group 3 (12 ± 7 mmHg) compared with both Group 1 (20 ± 9 mmHg) and Group 2 (17 ± 8 mmHg, P = 0.001). This result was confirmed at 6-12 months follow-up (P = 0.012). Similar 5-year all-cause mortality was observed among groups (34%, 36%, 14%, respectively, P = 0.056).
CONCLUSION: In patients with failed surgical aortic prosthesis, ViV-TAVR is an effective treatment option associated with sustained improved haemodynamics regardless of transcatheter valve type and use of balloon post-dilation. However, self-expandable valves with balloon post-dilation showed lower transprosthetic gradients.","['Manuela Muratori', 'Laura Fusini', 'Gloria Tamborini', 'Paola Gripari', 'Sarah Ghulam Ali', 'Valentina Mantegazza', 'Anna Garlaschè', 'Francesco Doni', 'Andrea Baggiano', 'Francesco Cannata', 'Alberico Del Torto', 'Fabio Fazzari', 'Antonio Frappampina', 'Daniele Junod', 'Riccardo Maragna', 'Saima Mushtaq', 'Luigi Tassetti', 'Alessandra Volpe', 'Stefano Galli', 'Franco Fabbiocchi', 'Marco Gennari', 'Marco Agrifoglio', 'Antonio L Bartorelli', 'Federico De Marco', 'Mauro Pepi', 'Gianluca Pontone']",European heart journal.

40370003,Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement for Structural Valve Deterioration After Aortic Valve Neocuspidization.,"BACKGROUND: Evidence on structural valve deterioration (SVD) after aortic valve neocuspidization (AVNeo) remains limited. While transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) offers a less invasive option, its feasibility is unclear. This study aimed to characterize SVD patients post-AVNeo and to assess TAVR feasibility.
METHODS: This retrospective study included 11 patients who underwent TAVR for SVD after AVNeo in Sendai Kousei Hospital between June 2017 and August 2024. Four patients with aortic stenosis (AS) and seven with aortic regurgitation (AR) due to SVD were included.
RESULTS: AS-SVD group showed shorter time interval from AVNeo to TAVR (50.5 [28.3-98.3] vs. 107.0 [97.0-131.0] months, p = 0.04) and smaller aortic annulus area (316.5 [259.8-375.0] vs. 538.0 [440.0-582.0] mm2, p = 0.005) than AR-SVD group. In TAVR, technical success was achieved in 91% of cases. Although coronary obstruction is a concern due to the long leaflet, no case occurred. Misidentification of the basal ring plane caused by the slack cusp resulted in second valve implantation (one case) and new conduction disturbance (two cases) due to deep implantation, and aortic contained rupture (one case) for oversized valve selection.
CONCLUSIONS: Rapid AS-SVD progression and AR-SVD occurring later than previously reported were observed, highlighting the need for further studies on AVNeo durability. TAVR after AVNeo was feasible.

40367359,Impact of Device Type and Orientation on Post-Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Complications in Bicuspid Aortic Valve Patients: A Computational Study.,"Currently, no clinical modality reliably assists clinicians in selecting the optimal transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) device orientation. This is critical for the growing population of young bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) TAVR candidates, who are at high risk for post-procedural complications. We aim to develop a predictive computational modeling workflow to identify which TAVR device and orientation will minimize the risk of paravalvular leakage (PVL), coronary obstruction, and flow-induced thrombogenicity. We compared the risk of post-TAVR complications across more than 30 device orientation combinations by virtually implanting self-expandable and balloon-expandable TAVR devices in three BAV patients. PVL severity varied significantly with device orientation, reaching up to 22.03 mL/beat with certain self-expandable devices. For self-expandable devices, orientations that ensured the shortest distance between the taller skirt region and PVL regions minimized PVL. A shorter frame height in balloon-expandable devices was insufficient to cover PVL regions in certain patients. Pearson correlation demonstrated a negative relationship between device oversizing and PVL. The risk of flow-induced thrombogenicity was positively correlated with PVL severity. A patient-specific computational modeling workflow can identify the optimal TAVR device and orientation, minimizing life-threatening post-TAVR complications and facilitating future reinterventions for young BAV TAVR candidates.","['Salwa Anam', 'Brandon Kovarovic', 'Puja Parikh', 'Marvin Slepian', 'Ashraf Hamdan', 'Rami Haj-Ali', 'Danny Bluestein']",ASAIO journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs : 1992),2025-05-14,10.1097/MAT.0000000000002459,https://doi.org/10.1097/MAT.0000000000002459,,Paid,Impact of Device Type and Orientation on Post Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Complications in Bicuspid Aortic Valve Patients A Computational Study ANAM 2025,Not available,"['Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Bicuspid Aortic Valve', 'Aortic Valve', 'Post-Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Aortic Valve Patients', 'Valve Replacement Complications', 'Valve Replacement', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'Bicuspid Aortic', 'Computational Study']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['TAVR', 'bicuspid aortic valve', 'coronary obstruction', 'digital twin', 'paravalvular leakage', 'predictive computational modeling']"

PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases were searched until November 2024 for studies reporting PPI incidence within 30 days post-TAVR. A random-effect model was used to pool risk ratios (RR) and standardized mean differences (SDM) for binary and continuous risk factors. Network meta-analysis estimated pooled risk differences (ΔRR) for binary predictors with male sex as the reference. Significant predictors were ranked based on their surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) values. A total of 108 studies comprising 77,538 patients (14,560 requiring PPI) were included. Male sex (RR: 1.13), baseline atrial fibrillation (AF) (RR: 1.12), 2nd degree Mobitz I (RR: 5.16) and Mobitz II (RR: 2.30) atrioventricular blocks (AVB), 3rd degree AVB (RR: 13.46), left anterior (LAHB) (RR: 1.79) and posterior hemiblocks (LPHB) (RR: 2.57), bifascicular block (RR: 2.34), right bundle branch block (RBBB) (RR: 3.20) and intraprocedural AVB (RR: 4.15) were identified as predictors for PPI post-TAVR. The risk of PPI was higher with self-expandable valves (RR: 1.79), subclavian access (RR: 1.75), and 29 mm prostheses (RR: 1.33) compared to balloon-expandable valves, transfemoral access, and 23 mm prostheses. Network meta-analysis ranked 3rd degree AVB (SUCRA <0.01), Mobitz I AVB (SUCRA: 0.14), Mobitz II AVB (SUCRA: 0.33), intraprocedural AVB (SUCRA: 0.42), bifascicular block (SUCRA: 0.48), RBBB (SUCRA: 0.49) and LPHB (SUCRA: 0.54) as major predictors of PPI in descending order of significance. In conclusion, clinicians should closely monitor conduction abnormalities as key predictors of PPI following TAVR. Additionally, other risk factors such as subclavian access, self-expanding implantation, AF, large prosthesis diameter, and male sex should not be overlooked.","['Negin Sadat Hosseini Mohammadi', 'Kiarash Tavakoli', 'Morvarid Taebi', 'Ali Zafari', 'Mobina Riahi', 'Mohammad Mahdi Molaei', 'Mashood Ahmad Farooqi', 'Ramtin Khanipour', 'Houshang Bavandpour Karvane', 'Soraya Shahrzad', 'Marmar Vaseghi', 'Ghanunjaya R Lakkirrddy', 'Jishanth Mattumpuram', 'Stylianos Tzeis', 'Yaser Jenab', 'Kaveh Hosseini']",The American journal of cardiology,2025-05-21,10.1016/j.amjcard.2025.05.009,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjcard.2025.05.009,,Paid,Comparative Prognostic Value of Risk Factors for Predicting Pacemaker Implantation After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement A Systematic Review and Network Meta analysis MOHAMMADI 2025,Not available,"['Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Predicting Pacemaker Implantation', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Systematic Review', 'Permanent pacemaker implantation', 'Predicting Pacemaker', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'Valve Replacement', 'SUCRA', 'Aortic Valve']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['artificial', 'atrioventricular block', 'cardiac conduction disorders', 'pacemaker', 'risk factors', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"
40334981,Prevalence and clinical outcomes of permanent conduction disturbances after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.,"BACKGROUND: A new-onset conduction disturbance is a major concern in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) but can resolve over time. This study aimed to evaluate the recovery in conduction disturbances post-TAVR and its association with clinical outcomes.
METHODS: This retrospective study included 780 TAVR patients at St. Marianna University between January 2016 and March 2023. Patients were stratified into four groups based on conduction status at six months post-TAVR: no conduction disturbance, recovered conduction disturbance [defined as a post-procedural pacemaker implantation with cumulative right ventricular pacing <40 % or complete left bundle branch block (CLBBB) at discharge but not at six months], permanent conduction disturbance (defined as pacemaker implantation with cumulative right ventricular pacing ≥40 % or CLBBB at both discharge and six months), and preprocedural conduction disturbance. The primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalization. The secondary outcome was the change in cardiac damage from pre-procedure to one-year post-TAVR.
RESULTS: Of 780 patients, 220 (28 %) had new-onset CLBBB or required a pacemaker implantation at discharge. Among these, 99 (45 %) had permanent conduction disturbances at six months. Over a median follow-up of 788 days, both permanent and preprocedural conduction disturbances were significantly associated with a higher incidence of heart failure hospitalization [hazard ratio (HR) 3.63; 95 % confidence interval (CI): 2.04-6.47, p < 0.01 and HR 2.50; 95 % CI: 1.27-4.90, p < 0.01), although no difference in all-cause mortality was observed. In contrast, the prognosis of patients with recovered conduction disturbance was comparable with those with no conduction disturbance. Patients with permanent and preprocedural conduction disturbances showed significant worsening cardiac damage.
CONCLUSION: Permanent and preprocedural conduction disturbances after TAVR were associated with increased heart failure hospitalizations, while the prognostic impact of recovered conduction disturbance may be limited.","['Takahiko Kai', 'Masaki Izumo', 'Masahiro Sekiguchi', 'Tetsu Tanaka', 'Taishi Okuno', 'Yukio Sato', 'Shingo Kuwata', 'Masashi Koga', 'Ikutaro Nakajima', 'Kenichi Sasaki', 'Yasuhiro Tanabe', 'Tomoo Harada', 'Yoshihiro J Akashi']",Journal of cardiology,2025-05-19,10.1016/j.jjcc.2025.04.013,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jjcc.2025.04.013,,Paid,Prevalence and clinical outcomes of permanent conduction disturbances after Transcatheter aortic valve replacement KAI 2025,Not available,"['aortic valve replacement', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'conduction disturbance', 'conduction', 'preprocedural conduction disturbances', 'valve replacement', 'preprocedural conduction', 'recovered conduction disturbance', 'permanent conduction disturbances', 'aortic valve']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['Aortic stenosis', 'Conduction disturbance', 'Transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"
40252070,Valve Dragging Technique in Valve Migration After Self-Expanding Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) may be considered for patients with symptomatic severe aortic regurgitation at high surgical risk.
CASE SUMMARY: This article presents the case of a 74-year-old man who presented with dyspnea and was diagnosed with severe aortic regurgitation. TAVR with a self-expanding valve was performed but complicated with valve migration toward the left ventricle, resulting in severe paravalvular regurgitation. Ultimately, the valve dragging technique was used to reposition the initial valve and a second valve was implanted, achieving satisfactory final outcomes.
DISCUSSION: This technique provides a novel strategy for valve migration after TAVR, avoiding surgical reintervention.

40252068,Unusual Case of Acute Type A Aortic Dissection During TAVR Bailout With a Self-Expanding Valve.,"BACKGROUND: Over the past 2 decades, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has emerged as a widely accepted treatment for patients with severe aortic valve stenosis. Acute aortic dissection, although rare, is a life-threatening complication associated with TAVR.
CASE SUMMARY: An older man with severe aortic stenosis underwent TAVR. During valve deployment, catheter manipulation caused intimal disruption, leading to acute type A aortic dissection (TAAD). Remarkably, the dissection spontaneously sealed after prosthetic valve placement, thereby avoiding emergency surgery. A 6-month follow-up computed tomography angiography scan showed no extension of the dissection.
DISCUSSION: In the case we report, the dissection spontaneously sealed with the use of a prosthetic valve, a finding that reinforces the feasibility of nonsurgical management of iatrogenic TAAD during TAVR in select cases.

It involved initiation of extracorporeal circulatory support, followed by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and, subsequently, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) using a TaurusElite valve (Peijia Medical). This strategy resulted in marked hemodynamic improvement.
DISCUSSION: This case highlights the efficacy and safety of concurrent PCI and TAVR as a lifesaving strategy for cardiogenic shock patients with concomitant severe CAD and AS.

Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is also recommended for penetrating aortic ulcer. Especially in older patients with severe AS and penetrating aortic ulcer at the same time, the surgical method brings significant risk.

CASE SUMMARY: We report successful noncoronary sinus pivot implantation (NCPI) of a 29-mm self-expanding valve in a high-risk PAR patient (Society of Thoracic Surgeons 8.2%) with extreme root dilatation and no calcification under the STABLE protocol. Post-procedure imaging confirmed hemodynamic success, no paravalvular leak, ventricular recovery, and optimal root remodeling.
DISCUSSION: This case highlights the role of annular-subannular anchoring (NCPI technique) and multimodality imaging in TAVR PAR with sinus of Valsalva aneurysm, addressing migration risks and expanding procedural feasibility beyond calcific stenosis-a critical advancement in an understudied population.

CASE SUMMARY: A 72-year-old man with type 0 BAV and sinus of Valsalva aneurysm underwent transapical J-Valve implantation for severe stenosis. Post-procedural incremental paravalvular leak (PVL) due to aneurysm-related malapposition was successfully treated with a self-expanding valve-in-valve (ViV) prosthesis (TaurusElite, 29 mm). Multimodal imaging, including echocardiography, computed tomography angiography, and 3-dimensional-printed modeling, ensured precise sealing with excellent hemodynamic results.
DISCUSSION: We report the first case of self-expanding ViV for PVL after J-Valve TAVR in type 0 BAV with aortic root aneurysm. This case underscores the feasibility of self-expanding ViV in complex BAV anatomy with concomitant aortic root pathology sighting into optimal device selection and imaging integration.

40035527,Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation in Brazilian Public Health System: A Single-Center Experience.,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has been established as the treatment of choice for severe aortic stenosis in high-risk patients as well as patients above 75 years old in all risk spectrums. Despite its worldwide adoption, implementation in lower-middle-income countries such as the Brazilian public health system (SUS, acronym in Portuguese) is incipient.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate TAVI exclusively within SUS patients.
METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study in a public tertiary hospital in southern Brazil. All patients who underwent TAVI between 2018 and 2024 were included. The cohort was divided into 2 temporal periods: from July 2018 to December 2022 (n = 60) and January 2023 to October 2024 (n = 65). The clinical and procedural characteristics and in-hospital, as well as 1 year of outcomes, were evaluated according to Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 (VARC-2) criteria.
RESULTS: During the study period, 125 patients underwent TAVI. The average age was 80 years (± 10), and 49.6% were male. The mean aortic valve area was 0.76 cm² and the mean gradient was 45 (±13) mm Hg. The mean STS predicted risk of mortality (STS-PROM) score was 4.6% (±3.6). Device success was achieved in 119 patients (95.2%). In-hospital mortality was 2 (1.6%). A new permanent pacemaker was required in 16 (12.8%). Demographic and clinical characteristics between the first and the second periods were similar.
CONCLUSIONS: The mortality and complications rate of TAVI performed within the scope of the Brazilian public health system were consistent with the clinical experience of other international registries.","['Guilherme Pinheiro Machado', 'Pedro Castilhos Crivelaro', 'Gustavo Neves de Araujo', 'Alan Pagnoncelli', 'Julia Carvalho da Silva', 'Camila Porto Cardoso', 'Wagner Tadeu Azeredo Azevedo', 'Rodrigo Petersen Saadi', 'Eduardo Keller Saadi', 'Orlando Wender', 'Marco Wainstein', 'Felipe Costa Fuchs']",Critical pathways in cardiology,2025-06-01,10.1097/HPC.0000000000000387,https://doi.org/10.1097/HPC.0000000000000387,,Paid,Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation in Brazilian Public Health System A Single Center Experience MACHADO 2025,Not available,"['Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Brazilian Public Health', 'Aortic Valve Implantation', 'Public Health System', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'Brazilian Public', 'Aortic Valve', 'Health System', 'Public Health', 'Valve Implantation']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['aortic stenosis', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement', 'unified health system']"
40412426,"ACURATE neo2 valve versus commercially available transcatheter heart valves in patients with severe aortic stenosis (ACURATE IDE): a multicentre, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial.","BACKGROUND: ACURATE neo2 is an open-cell, supra-annular, self-expanding transcatheter heart valve that is commercially available in over 50 countries but has not previously been evaluated in a randomised trial. ACURATE-IDE aimed to prospectively evaluate the safety and efficacy of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with the ACURATE neo2 valve compared with commercially available valves for the treatment of severe symptomatic aortic stenosis.
METHODS: In this multicentre, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial, patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis and any level of surgical risk were recruited from 71 medical centres in the USA and Canada. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to TAVR with ACURATE neo2 or one of the control valves, SAPIEN 3 (SAPIEN 3 or SAPIEN 3 Ultra) or Evolut, using permuted block randomisation with a pseudo-random number generator, and stratified by the clinical investigation site and type of control valve. All devices were implanted according to the manufacturer's instructions. The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause mortality, all stroke, and rehospitalisation at 1 year, tested for non-inferiority using a Bayesian approach. The primary analysis was performed in the intention-to-treat population and sensitivity analyses were done in the implanted population. The non-inferiority margin was 8·0%. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03735667, and is ongoing.
FINDINGS: Between June 10, 2019, and April 19, 2023, 1500 patients were recruited, of whom 752 were randomly assigned to the ACURATE neo2 group and 748 to the control group. The median age of participants was 79 years (IQR 74-83). 778 (51·9%) of 1500 patients were female and 721 (48·1%) were male. At 1 year, the posterior median probability of the primary composite endpoint was higher in the ACURATE neo2 group (16·2% [95% Bayesian credible interval 13·4-19·1) than in the control group (9·5% [7·5-11·9]; between-group difference 6·6% [3·0-10·2]). The upper bound of treatment difference exceeded the prespecified non-inferiority margin of 8%, with a posterior probability of treatment difference of >0·999. At 1 year, the ACURATE neo2 group, had significantly higher Kaplan-Meier rates of the composite endpoint of all-cause mortality, all stroke, and rehospitalisation (14·8% [95% CI 12·5-17·6] vs 9·1% [7·2-11·4]; hazard ratio [HR] 1·71 [95% CI 1·26-2·33]; p=0·0005). At 1 year, all-cause mortality occurred in 36 of 752 patients in the ACURATE neo2 group versus 28 of 748 patients in the control group (HR 1·30 [95% CI 0·80-2·14]), stroke in 41 patients versus 25 patients (1·68 [1·02-2·75]), and rehospitalisation in 38 patients versus 25 patients (1·57 [0·95-2·61]). Cardiovascular mortality (3·7% vs 1·8%, p=0·024) and spontaneous myocardial infarction at 1 year (2·4% vs 0·7%, p=0·0092) were more frequent in the ACURATE neo2 group than in the control group. Prosthetic valve aortic regurgitation (central plus paravalvular) at 1 year was significantly more frequent in the ACURATE neo2 group than in the control group (mild aortic regurgitation 42·5% vs 24·8%, p<0·0001; moderate 4·4% vs 1·8%, p=0·0070; severe 0·5% vs 0%; p=0·12).
INTERPRETATION: In patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis, TAVR with ACURATE neo2 did not meet non-inferiority and resulted in significantly worse outcomes with respect to the primary endpoint of composite of all-cause mortality, all stroke, and rehospitalisation at 1 year when compared with commercial valves.

40411760,"Mitral valve surgery after failed transcatheter intervention for mitral regurgitation: surgical techniques, challenges, and outcomes.","OBJECTIVES: This review article aims to examine the surgical approach to patients with failed mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (M-TEER), focusing on operative challenges, decision-making, and contemporary outcome data. Technical considerations, including device removal and the management of complex mitral valve (MV) anatomy is discussed.
METHODS: We performed a comprehensive literature review and gathered the experience from high-volume centers in the surgical management of failed M-TEER.
RESULTS: MV surgery after failed M-TEER is a complex but increasingly necessary procedure as the use of M-TEER grows. It occurs in up to 6% of patients, with a median age of 70-76 years at the moment of failure and a median time to failure of < 6 months. MV surgery following M-TEER is associated with high mortality and morbidity, with a reported 30-day mortality ranging from 10-40% and 1-year survival below 60%. Functional device failure, structural device failure, MV disease progression and infective endocarditis are frequent mechanisms of M-TEER failure. Surgical MV repair is the preferred management strategy; however, due to the technical and anatomical complexity, MV replacement is performed much more frequently (MV repair rates <10%).
CONCLUSIONS: MV surgery after failed M-TEER poses technical challenges due to the presence of altered anatomy, the need for concomitant procedures, and the patient's comorbidities. While surgical intervention carries increased risks, it remains the definitive treatment for failed M-TEER, offering durable relief from MR. Due to the technical complexities associated with these procedures, strong consideration should be given to transferring patients requiring MV surgery after failed M-TEER to high-volume MV centers.","['Mateo Marin-Cuartas', 'Syed Zaid', 'Jörg Kempfert', 'Michael A Borger', 'Serdar Akansel', 'Thilo Noack', 'David Holzhey', 'Tsuyoshi Kaneko', 'Isaac George', 'Gorav Ailawadi', 'Robert L Smith', 'Arnar Geirrson', 'Ahmed El-Eshmawi', 'Dimosthenis Pandis', 'Suzanne De Waha', 'Nikolaos Bonaros', 'Fabien Praz', 'Maurizio Taramasso', 'Michele De Bonis', 'Lenard Conradi', 'Christian Hagl', 'Nicolas Doll', 'Mahmoud Wehbe', 'Alexey Dashkevich', 'Manuela De La Cuesta', 'Jagdip Kang', 'Zara Dietze', 'Philipp Kiefer', 'Gilbert H L Tang']",European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery,2025-05-24,10.1093/ejcts/ezaf179,https://doi.org/10.1093/ejcts/ezaf179,,Paid,Mitral valve surgery after failed transcatheter intervention for mitral regurgitation surgical techniques challenges and outcomes MARIN-CUARTAS 2025,Not available,"['failed M-TEER', 'failed mitral transcatheter', 'M-TEER', 'failed', 'Mitral valve surgery', 'Mitral valve', 'mitral regurgitation', 'surgery', 'surgery after failed', 'Mitral']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['Mitral regurgitation', 'Mitral valve repair', 'Mitral valve replacement', 'mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair']"

40392421,When surgery is not an option: case report of transcatheter valve-in-valve replacement for mitral valve dysfunction.,"BACKGROUND: Heart valve diseases affect over 100 million people globally, with mitral regurgitation being the most common in developed countries. Bioprosthetic heart valves, frequently used for replacement, typically last 10-15 years before degeneration. Repeat open-heart surgery for valve replacement poses high risks, especially in older or high-risk patients. Following the success of transcatheter aortic valve replacement, transcatheter mitral valve-in-valve replacement has emerged as a less invasive alternative for patients deemed inoperable due to high surgical risks.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 69-year-old male with a history of mitral bioprosthetic valve replacement and thoracic radiotherapy who presented with shortness of breath and NYHA class 3 functional capacity. Echocardiography revealed bioprosthetic valve dysfunction with a mean gradient of 13 mmHg and pulmonary artery pressure of 70 mmHg. Given his high surgical risk (The Society of Thoracic Surgeons score 10.9%, EuroScore2 9.8%) and prior thoracic radiotherapy, a transcatheter valve-in-valve procedure was planned. A 29 mm MyVal valve was successfully implanted via a transseptal approach, resulting in complete resolution of mitral regurgitation and a mean gradient of 3 mmHg post-procedure. The patient was discharged without complications and reported improved functional capacity (NYHA class 1) at follow-up.
CONCLUSION: This case highlights the successful application of transcatheter valve-in-valve replacement for a patient with bioprosthetic mitral valve dysfunction who was at high surgical risk. The procedure, performed using a transseptal approach with a 29 mm MyVal valve, resulted in significant symptomatic and hemodynamic improvement with no complications. The patient's functional capacity improved dramatically, and follow-up imaging confirmed the effective functioning of the new valve. This case supports the viability of transcatheter techniques as a preferred alternative for inoperable patients with mitral valve dysfunction, contributing valuable insights to the growing field of minimally invasive cardiac interventions. As technology advances, transcatheter solutions are expected to offer safer and more effective treatments for bioprosthetic valve failures.","['Yakup Alsancak', 'Hasan Kan', 'Ahmet Seyfettin Gürbüz', 'Nergiz Aydın', 'Muhammed Fatih Kaleli']",The Egyptian heart journal : (EHJ) : official bulletin of the Egyptian Society of Cardiology,2025-05-20,10.1186/s43044-025-00646-y,https://doi.org/10.1186/s43044-025-00646-y,PMC12092925,Free,When surgery is not an option case report of transcatheter valve in valve replacement for mitral valve dysfunction ALSANCAK 2025,pdfs\When surgery is not an option case report of transcatheter valve in valve replacement for mitral valve dysfunction ALSANCAK 2025.pdf,"['valve', 'mitral valve', 'mitral valve dysfunction', 'valve replacement', 'bioprosthetic valve', 'mitral', 'mitral bioprosthetic valve', 'valve dysfunction', 'bioprosthetic valve replacement', 'bioprosthetic valve dysfunction']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['Bioprosthetic valve dysfunction', 'Thoracic radiotherapy', 'Transcatheter mitral valve replacement', 'Transseptal approach', 'Valve-in-valve']"
40388090,Advances in Clinical Cardiology 2024: A Summary of Key Clinical Trials.,"INTRODUCTION: In 2024, numerous key clinical trials in the field of clinical cardiology have been published or presented at major international conferences. This review seeks to collate and summarise these trials and reflect on their clinical context.
METHODS: The authors evaluated all clinical trials presented at major cardiology conferences during 2024 with a focus on clinical trials which would influence and/or change current clinical practice. We reviewed clinical trials presented at all major international conferences including the American College of Cardiology (ACC), European Association for Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions (EuroPCR), European Society of Cardiology (ESC), Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics (TCT), American Heart Association (AHA), European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA), Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI), TVT-The Heart Summit (TVT) and Cardiovascular Research Technologies (CRT). Trials considered to have highest impact and/or broad relevance across the field of clinical cardiology, with a high likelihood to change or impact upon clinical practice were included.
RESULTS: Over 90 key cardiology clinical trials were identified across the spectrum of clinical cardiology. Important updates in percutaneous coronary intervention were reviewed including new ESC guidance and several key trials in the field of coronary physiology (FAVOR III), drug-coated balloons (REGCAGE-FREE, AGENT-IDE), shock, and acute coronary syndromes (SENIOR-RITA, DanGer-Shock). Structural trials included major updates in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) from EARLY-TAVR, TAVR-UNLOAD and NOTION 3, as well as seminal trials in tricuspid (TRISCEND II) and mitral intervention (MATTERHORN). Key updates in preventative cardiology included new data in lipoprotein (a) pharmacotherapy, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol reduction and hypertension management (BPROAD, BedMed, KRAKEN), as well as several key trials in heart failure (SUMMIT, FINEARTS) hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (SEQUOIA-HCM) and cardiac amyloid (HELIOS-B).
CONCLUSION: The review presents a concise summary of the key clinical cardiology trials published or presented during the past year and should be of interest to clinicians and researchers in the field of cardiology.","['Patrick Savage', 'Michael Campbell', 'Meadhbh Hogg', 'Daniel McElhatton', 'Ian Menown']",Advances in therapy,2025-05-19,10.1007/s12325-025-03220-9,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12325-025-03220-9,PMC11213809,Free,Advances in Clinical Cardiology 2024 A Summary of Key Clinical Trials SAVAGE 2025,pdfs\Advances in Clinical Cardiology 2024 A Summary of Key Clinical Trials SAVAGE 2025.pdf,"['Clinical Trials', 'Key Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Cardiology', 'Cardiology', 'clinical trials presented', 'Clinical', 'cardiology clinical trials', 'clinical cardiology trials', 'Trials', 'Heart Rhythm Association']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['Acute coronary syndromes', 'Cardiology', 'Clinical trials', 'Electrophysiology', 'Heart failure', 'Intervention', 'Prevention', 'Structural']"

CASE SUMMARY: We present a 71-year-old woman with recurrent heart failure and severe mixed functional mitral regurgitation and a small neo-left ventricular outflow tract, at risk of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Given her surgical risk and complex anatomy, we chose TMVR with the Peijia HighLife Clarity valve, which features an ""open-window"" design to reduce left ventricular outflow tract obstruction risk.

40422955,One-Year Outcome of Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement with Concomitant SignificantTricuspid Regurgitation.,"Background: The outcome of patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) can be affected by coexisting tricuspid regurgitation (TR). The aim of the study is to investigate the clinical results of patients undergoing TAVR with or without concomitant significant TR. Methods: Patients undergoing TAVR were divided into two groups according to TR severity: none/mild TR (low-grade) and moderate/severe TR (significant). Data were analysed and compared. Primary endpoint was the mortality 1-year. Secondary endpoints were re-hospitalization and the degree of postoperative and 1-year TR. Results: TAVR procedures were performed in 345 patients between September 2011 and February 2020. Median STS score was 4.3% (IQR: 2.6-7.2), median LVEF was 59.0% (IQR: 45.0-62.0), median aortic area was 0.70cm2 (IQR: 0.60-0.86), median mean gradient was 43.0mmHg (IQR: 36.0-53.0). Before TAVR, 297 patients (86.1%) had low-grade TR and 48 (13.9%) significant TR. Mean age was 82.4 ± 5.7 and 83.8 ± 6.2 years in low-grade and significant TR group, respectively (p = 0.109), with 47.5% (low-grade TR) and 56.3% (significant TR) of female patients (p = 0.279). Patients showed differences in EuroSCORE-II (3.2% (IQR: 1.9-5.7) in low-grade TR vs. 5.6% (IQR: 3.7-8.1) in significant TR; p < 0.001), impaired right ventricular function (3.0% vs. 20.8%; p < 0.001) and pulmonary hypertension (9.1% vs. 39.6%; p < 0.001). Mean valve size was 27.7 ± 2.9 mm. Hospital mortality was 2.0% in low-grade TR and 4.2% in significantTR patients (p = 0.308). Among discharged patients (n = 337), seven patients died within 30 days (2.0% low-grade TR; 2.1% significant TR; logrank test p = 0.154) and 40 were re-hospitalized for heart failure (11.1% low-grade TR; 14.6% significant TR; p = 0.470). After one year, 26 patients died, corresponding to a mortality of 7.9 deaths per 100-person year (95% CI 5.2-12.0) in low-grade TR group and 9.1 deaths per 100-person year (95% CI 3.4-24.3) in significant TR group (logrank test p = 0.815), with HR (low grade vs. significant TR) of 0.87, 95% CI 0.26-2.89. Re-hospitalization for heart failure was 16.5% and 19.6% for low-grade and significant TR, respectively (p = 0.713). Echocardiographic and functional changes over time showed no significant interaction between TR and time. Conclusions: In our experience, patients undergoing TAVR showed similar 30-day and 1-year outcome and re-hospitalization rate, regardless of the degree of concomitant tricuspid regurgitation.","['Enrico Ferrari', 'Alberto Pozzoli', 'Catherine Klersy', 'Elena Caporali', 'Stefanos Demertzis', 'Giovanni Pedrazzini']",Journal of cardiovascular development and disease,2025-05-14,10.3390/jcdd12050184,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcdd12050184,,Paid,One Year Outcome of Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement with Concomitant SignificantTricuspid Regurgitation FERRARI 2025,Not available,"['Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'patients undergoing TAVR', 'Patients Undergoing Transcatheter', 'Patients Undergoing', 'undergoing TAVR', 'Concomitant SignificantTricuspid Regurgitation', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'Undergoing Transcatheter']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['aortic valve stenosis', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement', 'tricuspid valve regurgitation']"
40414715,Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes of Cardiac Surgery and Transcatheter Procedures in Patients With Adult Congenital Heart Disease　- Insights From Japanese Registry Data.,"BACKGROUND: Adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) patients often require additional interventions or surgeries in adulthood, presenting new clinical challenges. However, clinical research on the current status and outcomes of cardiac procedures in ACHD patients remains limited.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We analyzed the Japanese Registry of All Cardiac and Vascular Diseases-Diagnosis Procedure Combination (JROAD-DPC) database between April 2013 and March 2021. Patients with ACHD (aged >15 years) who underwent major cardiac surgery and transcatheter procedures were included. We assessed clinical background, treatment, length of hospital stay, and in-hospital mortality. In all, 22,490 patients with ACHD (median age 56 years [interquartile range 36-69 years], 51.1% female) were enrolled. Emergency hospitalizations and in-hospital deaths were observed in 3.7% and 1.1% of cases, respectively. Congenital heart operations with high in-hospital mortality (>5.0%) included aortic arch repair, systemic-to-pulmonary artery shunts, cardiac tumor resection, coronary artery bypass grafting, 3-valve replacement, and ventricular assist device implantation. Although stent graft procedures had the highest in-hospital mortality rate (2.6%), other transcatheter procedures, such as transcatheter patent ductus arteriosus closure, atrial septal defect closure, and catheter ablation, had in-hospital mortality rates of <1.0%.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides fundamental insights into the current clinical characteristics and outcomes associated with procedures in patients with ACHD. The in-hospital mortality rates for both cardiac surgery and transcatheter procedures in Japanese ACHD patients were low, demonstrating acceptable outcomes.","['Takumi Osawa', 'Tomoko Machino-Ohtsuka', 'Ruriko Numata', 'Ayako Kuraoka', 'Mike Saji', 'Koshiro Kanaoka', 'Yoko Sumita', 'Naoto Kawamatsu', 'Hideyuki Kato', 'Yuji Hiramatsu', 'Tomoko Ishizu']",Circulation journal : official journal of the Japanese Circulation Society,2025-05-25,10.1253/circj.CJ-24-0843,https://doi.org/10.1253/circj.CJ-24-0843,,Paid,Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes of Cardiac Surgery and Transcatheter Procedures in Patients With Adult Congenital Heart Disease Insights From Japanese Registry Data OSAWA 2025,Not available,"['Adult Congenital Heart', 'Congenital Heart Disease', 'Japanese Registry Data', 'Adult Congenital', 'Registry Data', 'Congenital Heart', 'Heart Disease', 'Japanese ACHD patients', 'Japanese Registry', 'Transcatheter Procedures']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['Adult congenital heart disease', 'Cardiac surgery', 'Congenital heart disease', 'Japanese Registry of All Cardiac and Vascular Diseases-Diagnosis Procedure Combination (JROAD-DPC)', 'Percutaneous interventions']"

The accurate assessment of RV function is however limited by the presence of concomitant tricuspid regurgitation (TR). Implantation of a novel transcatheter tricuspid valve device in this case highlights the importance of recognizing these limitations, and the need to define alternative ways to measure RV systolic function, contextualized to pulmonary pressure in patients with severe TR. It also demonstrates the clinical potential of perforation of the pop-off zone in this prosthesis, to create mild residual TR, thereby reducing the increase in RV afterload of this intervention, and its impact on RV systolic function.","['Hannah Kempton', 'Mayooran Namasivayam', 'Thomas Meredith', 'Martin Shaw', 'Paul Jansz', 'David W M Muller']",JACC.

40394915,Short-term outcomes of transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement with Venus-P valve in patients with moderate-to-severe pulmonary regurgitation and right ventricular systolic dysfunction.,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the short-term outcomes of transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement (TPVR) using the Venus-P valve in patients with moderate-to-severe pulmonary regurgitation and right ventricular systolic dysfunction (RVSD) following surgical repair of complex congenital heart disease.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on patients undergoing Venus-P valve implantation (TPVR group, n=28) or surgical pulmonary valve replacement (SPVR group, n=19) at Fuwai Hospital between February 2014 and February 2024. All patients had moderate-to-severe pulmonary regurgitation with right ventricular ejection fraction less than 45% preoperatively. Postoperative pulmonary valve function and ventricular parameters were assessed at discharge and during 6-month follow-up.
RESULTS: All procedures were successfully completed with no early mortality. At 6 months, the TPVR group demonstrated significantly lower pulmonary valve transvalvular pressure gradients compared to the SPVR group (P<0.05). Both groups exhibited significant improvements from baseline in NYHA functional class, biventricular ejection fractions, and right ventricular end-diastolic volume index (all P<0.05). The reduction in right ventricular end-diastolic diameter differed between the two groups (P<0.01); however, multivariable analysis revealed no association between this difference and surgical approach (β=4.4, P>0.05). In the TPVR group, QRS duration shortened significantly postoperatively (P<0.01), with improvements in left ventricular end-diastolic volume index and cardiac index (both P<0.01), but these improvements did not differ significantly from the SPVR group (all P>0.05). During the follow-up, one patient in each group developed infective endocarditis within 1-month post-procedure; both were successfully treated with antibiotics. No other major complications were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: For patients with moderate-to-severe pulmonary regurgitation and RVSD, TPVR using the Venus-P valve effectively improves short-term pulmonary valve function and ventricular performance with a favorable safety profile, which shows potential as a minimally invasive alternative to SPVR .
目的: 评估Venus-P瓣膜经导管肺动脉瓣置换术（TPVR）治疗复杂先天性心脏病术后中重度肺动脉瓣反流合并右心室收缩功能不全患者的近期疗效。方法: 回顾性纳入2014年2月至2024年2月于阜外医院接受Venus-P瓣膜TPVR治疗（28例）或外科肺动脉瓣置换术（SPVR）治疗（19例）的患者。所有患者术前均存在中重度肺动脉瓣反流且右心室射血分数小于45%。评估患者出院时及随访期间（随访至术后6个月）肺动脉瓣功能与心室功能的变化，并比较两种术式的疗效差异。结果: 所有患者均顺利完成手术，术后无早期死亡。术后6个月，TPVR组肺动脉瓣跨瓣压差显著低于SPVR组（P<0.05）。两组患者的纽约心脏协会心功能分级、双心室射血分数及右心室舒张末期容积指数较术前均显著改善（均P<0.05）。术后右心室舒张末期横径改善幅度在两组间存在显著差异（P<0.01），多变量分析提示该差异与术式无关（β=4.4，P>0.05）。TPVR组术后QRS时限显著缩短（P<0.01），左心室舒张末期容积指数及心脏指数亦有改善（均P<0.01），但改善幅度与SPVR组差异无统计学意义（均P>0.05）。随访期间，两组各有1例患者术后1个月发生感染性心内膜炎，经抗感染治疗痊愈，未见其他严重并发症。结论: 对于中重度肺动脉瓣反流合并右心室收缩功能不全的患者，Venus-P瓣膜TPVR可有效改善短期肺动脉瓣功能及心室功能，且安全性良好，具有成为SPVR微创替代方案的潜力。.","['Haiyue Xie', 'Wenhao Zhu', 'Zhiyuan Xia', 'Gejun Zhang']",Zhejiang da xue xue bao.

40394913,Comparison Between Gated Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Angiography and Computed Tomography Angiography for Harmony Valve Anatomic Fit Analysis.,"AIMS: To determine if electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) can be used to assess candidacy for transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement with the Harmony valve.
BACKGROUND: Anatomic fit assessment for the Harmony valve is conducted with retrospectively gated computed tomography angiography (CTA). The suitability of MRA for this purpose has not been assessed.
METHODS: We analyzed patients who were screened for Harmony valve candidacy at our institution through July 2024 and had both ECG-gated MRA and CTA. Measurements included RVOT centerline length and RVOT perimeters and diameters at 5 mm increments. The Medtronic fit algorithm was applied to CTA and MRA measurements. Correlation between CTA and MRA measurements was determined with intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bland-Altman analysis.
RESULTS: The study included 36 patients who met the inclusion criteria. The ICC between CTA and MRA was 0.99 for RVOT length, 0.92 for minimum perimeter-derived diameter, and 0.71 for proximal perimeter-derived diameter (all p < 0.001). MRA fit analysis was concordant with the Medtronic CTA-derived fit analysis in 72% of patients and was concordant with fit analysis based on internal CTA measurements in 75%.
CONCLUSION: RVOT measurements on ECG-gated MRA images correlate well with those made from retrospectively gated CTA. Although perimeter plots generated from ECG-gated MRA and CTA measurements were discordant in some patients, the differences were minor and could still be interpreted to indicate implantable anatomy by the operator. These findings suggest that ECG-gated MRA may be an acceptable surrogate for CTA during the anatomic screening process.","['Zsofia B Long', 'Doff B McElhinney', 'Ayush Jaggi', 'Ali B Syed', 'Frandics P Chan', 'Shiraz A Maskatia']",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,2025-05-20,10.1002/ccd.31594,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.31594,,Paid,Comparison Between Gated Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Angiography and Computed Tomography Angiography for Harmony Valve Anatomic Fit Analysis LONG 2025,Not available,"['Cardiac Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Angiography', 'Gated Cardiac Magnetic', 'Computed Tomography Angiography', 'Harmony Valve', 'gated magnetic resonance', 'Harmony Valve Anatomic', 'Cardiac Magnetic', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Resonance Angiography']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['pulmonary regurgitation', 'pulmonary stenosis', 'tetralogy of fallot', 'transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement']"
40392782,Comparative effects of transcatheter versus surgical pulmonary valve replacement: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: Transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement (TPVR) is developed as a non-surgical, minimally invasive procedure to reduce the need for re-do cardiac surgical interventions. However, its impacts on patient outcomes are less clear. This study aims to investigate the effects of TPVR among patients with pulmonary valve or right ventricular outflow tract dysfunctions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, EMBASE, CINAHL Complete, and Web of Science, from database inception to March 1, 2024, to identify studies that assessed the comparative effectiveness of transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement (TPVR) and surgical pulmonary valve replacement (SPVR). The key outcomes of interest included mortality, pulmonary regurgitation (PR), infective endocarditis (IE), re-intervention, improvements in cardiac failure based on the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification, and adverse events. Meta-analyses using a random-effects model were performed.
RESULTS: A total of 28 studies (n = 16,150) were included. The meta-analyses depicted that when compared with SPVR, TPVR reduced risks of mortality by 36% (odds ratio [OR] = 0.64 [95% confidence interval, CI: 0.43, 0.95]), but conferred a three-fold greater odd of IE over the follow-up duration (OR = 3.10 [95% CI: 2.22, 4.33]). No significant differences were observed for 30-day mortality, and the early PR, IE and re-intervention, as well as the PR and re-intervention during follow-up. Meta-analyzed results across the outcome measures varied according to geographical region, publication year cut-off, and income status of country. All patients who had undergone valve replacement showed improvements in heart function and experienced relevant post-procedural complications.
CONCLUSIONS: TPVR afforded significant clinical benefits in patient survival, but nonetheless, it was associated with an elevated risk for infective endocarditis.","['Bunchai Chongmelaxme', 'Kok Pim Kua', 'Chanokpol Amornvetchayakul', 'Nichapond Chawviriyathep', 'Thunyapat Kerdklinhom']",PloS one,2025-05-27,10.1371/journal.pone.0322041,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0322041,PMC12091831,Free,Comparative effects of transcatheter versus surgical pulmonary valve replacement A systematic review and meta analysis CHONGMELAXME 2025,pdfs\Comparative effects of transcatheter versus surgical pulmonary valve replacement A systematic review and meta analysis CHONGMELAXME 2025.pdf,"['pulmonary valve replacement', 'Transcatheter pulmonary valve', 'surgical pulmonary valve', 'pulmonary valve', 'valve replacement', 'versus surgical pulmonary', 'transcatheter versus surgical', 'pulmonary valve requiring', 'valve', 'transcatheter valve Femoral']",2025-05-27,Pending,[]
40392421,When surgery is not an option: case report of transcatheter valve-in-valve replacement for mitral valve dysfunction.,"BACKGROUND: Heart valve diseases affect over 100 million people globally, with mitral regurgitation being the most common in developed countries. Bioprosthetic heart valves, frequently used for replacement, typically last 10-15 years before degeneration. Repeat open-heart surgery for valve replacement poses high risks, especially in older or high-risk patients. Following the success of transcatheter aortic valve replacement, transcatheter mitral valve-in-valve replacement has emerged as a less invasive alternative for patients deemed inoperable due to high surgical risks.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 69-year-old male with a history of mitral bioprosthetic valve replacement and thoracic radiotherapy who presented with shortness of breath and NYHA class 3 functional capacity. Echocardiography revealed bioprosthetic valve dysfunction with a mean gradient of 13 mmHg and pulmonary artery pressure of 70 mmHg. Given his high surgical risk (The Society of Thoracic Surgeons score 10.9%, EuroScore2 9.8%) and prior thoracic radiotherapy, a transcatheter valve-in-valve procedure was planned. A 29 mm MyVal valve was successfully implanted via a transseptal approach, resulting in complete resolution of mitral regurgitation and a mean gradient of 3 mmHg post-procedure. The patient was discharged without complications and reported improved functional capacity (NYHA class 1) at follow-up.
CONCLUSION: This case highlights the successful application of transcatheter valve-in-valve replacement for a patient with bioprosthetic mitral valve dysfunction who was at high surgical risk. The procedure, performed using a transseptal approach with a 29 mm MyVal valve, resulted in significant symptomatic and hemodynamic improvement with no complications. The patient's functional capacity improved dramatically, and follow-up imaging confirmed the effective functioning of the new valve. This case supports the viability of transcatheter techniques as a preferred alternative for inoperable patients with mitral valve dysfunction, contributing valuable insights to the growing field of minimally invasive cardiac interventions. As technology advances, transcatheter solutions are expected to offer safer and more effective treatments for bioprosthetic valve failures.","['Yakup Alsancak', 'Hasan Kan', 'Ahmet Seyfettin Gürbüz', 'Nergiz Aydın', 'Muhammed Fatih Kaleli']",The Egyptian heart journal : (EHJ) : official bulletin of the Egyptian Society of Cardiology,2025-05-20,10.1186/s43044-025-00646-y,https://doi.org/10.1186/s43044-025-00646-y,PMC12092925,Free,When surgery is not an option case report of transcatheter valve in valve replacement for mitral valve dysfunction ALSANCAK 2025,pdfs\When surgery is not an option case report of transcatheter valve in valve replacement for mitral valve dysfunction ALSANCAK 2025.pdf,"['valve', 'mitral valve', 'mitral valve dysfunction', 'valve replacement', 'bioprosthetic valve', 'mitral', 'mitral bioprosthetic valve', 'valve dysfunction', 'bioprosthetic valve replacement', 'bioprosthetic valve dysfunction']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['Bioprosthetic valve dysfunction', 'Thoracic radiotherapy', 'Transcatheter mitral valve replacement', 'Transseptal approach', 'Valve-in-valve']"
40370817,Valve type and post-dilation impact on transprosthetic gradients in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve-in-valve procedure.,"AIMS: Valve-in-Valve transcatheter aortic valve replacement (ViV-TAVR) is an appealing treatment option for patients with degenerated aortic bioprosthetic valves. However, higher post-procedural transprosthetic gradients are more common after ViV-TAVR than after TAVR for native aortic valve stenosis. We sought to evaluate the impact of type of implanted valve and balloon post-dilation on echocardiographic results and mortality in ViV-TAVR patients.
METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred and eleven consecutive patients were enrolled. A balloon-expandable valve, a self-expandable valve without balloon post-dilation, and a self-expandable valve with balloon post-dilation were performed in 35 (Group 1), 39 (Group 2), and 37 (Group 3) patients, respectively. All patients underwent comprehensive transthoracic echocardiography at baseline, discharge, and 6-12 months follow-up. Successful ViV-TAVR was performed in 110 patients (99%). Baseline transprosthetic gradients, left ventricular volumes, ejection fraction, and pulmonary artery systolic pressure were similar among groups. All groups experienced a significant reduction in post-procedural gradients at discharge and during the 6-12 months follow-up compared with baseline. At discharge, the lowest mean gradient was observed in Group 3 (12 ± 7 mmHg) compared with both Group 1 (20 ± 9 mmHg) and Group 2 (17 ± 8 mmHg, P = 0.001). This result was confirmed at 6-12 months follow-up (P = 0.012). Similar 5-year all-cause mortality was observed among groups (34%, 36%, 14%, respectively, P = 0.056).
CONCLUSION: In patients with failed surgical aortic prosthesis, ViV-TAVR is an effective treatment option associated with sustained improved haemodynamics regardless of transcatheter valve type and use of balloon post-dilation. However, self-expandable valves with balloon post-dilation showed lower transprosthetic gradients.","['Manuela Muratori', 'Laura Fusini', 'Gloria Tamborini', 'Paola Gripari', 'Sarah Ghulam Ali', 'Valentina Mantegazza', 'Anna Garlaschè', 'Francesco Doni', 'Andrea Baggiano', 'Francesco Cannata', 'Alberico Del Torto', 'Fabio Fazzari', 'Antonio Frappampina', 'Daniele Junod', 'Riccardo Maragna', 'Saima Mushtaq', 'Luigi Tassetti', 'Alessandra Volpe', 'Stefano Galli', 'Franco Fabbiocchi', 'Marco Gennari', 'Marco Agrifoglio', 'Antonio L Bartorelli', 'Federico De Marco', 'Mauro Pepi', 'Gianluca Pontone']",European heart journal.

CASE SUMMARY: A 42-year-old man with a history of tetralogy of Fallot who underwent atrial septal defect repair and unclogging of the RVOT 10 years ago and pericardiectomy with valvuloplasty 2 years ago for constrictive pericarditis presented with progressive bilateral lower limb pitting edema, along with exertional dyspnea. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed RVOT stenosis, massive PR, and right ventricular dysfunction. Transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement VenusP-Valve significantly improved ventricular function.
DISCUSSION: This case illustrates the efficacy of transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement in the management of RVOT obstruction and PR after complex cardiac surgery.

40422955,One-Year Outcome of Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement with Concomitant SignificantTricuspid Regurgitation.,"Background: The outcome of patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) can be affected by coexisting tricuspid regurgitation (TR). The aim of the study is to investigate the clinical results of patients undergoing TAVR with or without concomitant significant TR. Methods: Patients undergoing TAVR were divided into two groups according to TR severity: none/mild TR (low-grade) and moderate/severe TR (significant). Data were analysed and compared. Primary endpoint was the mortality 1-year. Secondary endpoints were re-hospitalization and the degree of postoperative and 1-year TR. Results: TAVR procedures were performed in 345 patients between September 2011 and February 2020. Median STS score was 4.3% (IQR: 2.6-7.2), median LVEF was 59.0% (IQR: 45.0-62.0), median aortic area was 0.70cm2 (IQR: 0.60-0.86), median mean gradient was 43.0mmHg (IQR: 36.0-53.0). Before TAVR, 297 patients (86.1%) had low-grade TR and 48 (13.9%) significant TR. Mean age was 82.4 ± 5.7 and 83.8 ± 6.2 years in low-grade and significant TR group, respectively (p = 0.109), with 47.5% (low-grade TR) and 56.3% (significant TR) of female patients (p = 0.279). Patients showed differences in EuroSCORE-II (3.2% (IQR: 1.9-5.7) in low-grade TR vs. 5.6% (IQR: 3.7-8.1) in significant TR; p < 0.001), impaired right ventricular function (3.0% vs. 20.8%; p < 0.001) and pulmonary hypertension (9.1% vs. 39.6%; p < 0.001). Mean valve size was 27.7 ± 2.9 mm. Hospital mortality was 2.0% in low-grade TR and 4.2% in significantTR patients (p = 0.308). Among discharged patients (n = 337), seven patients died within 30 days (2.0% low-grade TR; 2.1% significant TR; logrank test p = 0.154) and 40 were re-hospitalized for heart failure (11.1% low-grade TR; 14.6% significant TR; p = 0.470). After one year, 26 patients died, corresponding to a mortality of 7.9 deaths per 100-person year (95% CI 5.2-12.0) in low-grade TR group and 9.1 deaths per 100-person year (95% CI 3.4-24.3) in significant TR group (logrank test p = 0.815), with HR (low grade vs. significant TR) of 0.87, 95% CI 0.26-2.89. Re-hospitalization for heart failure was 16.5% and 19.6% for low-grade and significant TR, respectively (p = 0.713). Echocardiographic and functional changes over time showed no significant interaction between TR and time. Conclusions: In our experience, patients undergoing TAVR showed similar 30-day and 1-year outcome and re-hospitalization rate, regardless of the degree of concomitant tricuspid regurgitation.","['Enrico Ferrari', 'Alberto Pozzoli', 'Catherine Klersy', 'Elena Caporali', 'Stefanos Demertzis', 'Giovanni Pedrazzini']",Journal of cardiovascular development and disease,2025-05-14,10.3390/jcdd12050184,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcdd12050184,,Paid,One Year Outcome of Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement with Concomitant SignificantTricuspid Regurgitation FERRARI 2025,Not available,"['Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'patients undergoing TAVR', 'Patients Undergoing Transcatheter', 'Patients Undergoing', 'undergoing TAVR', 'Concomitant SignificantTricuspid Regurgitation', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'Undergoing Transcatheter']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['aortic valve stenosis', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement', 'tricuspid valve regurgitation']"
40412426,"ACURATE neo2 valve versus commercially available transcatheter heart valves in patients with severe aortic stenosis (ACURATE IDE): a multicentre, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial.","BACKGROUND: ACURATE neo2 is an open-cell, supra-annular, self-expanding transcatheter heart valve that is commercially available in over 50 countries but has not previously been evaluated in a randomised trial. ACURATE-IDE aimed to prospectively evaluate the safety and efficacy of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with the ACURATE neo2 valve compared with commercially available valves for the treatment of severe symptomatic aortic stenosis.
METHODS: In this multicentre, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial, patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis and any level of surgical risk were recruited from 71 medical centres in the USA and Canada. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to TAVR with ACURATE neo2 or one of the control valves, SAPIEN 3 (SAPIEN 3 or SAPIEN 3 Ultra) or Evolut, using permuted block randomisation with a pseudo-random number generator, and stratified by the clinical investigation site and type of control valve. All devices were implanted according to the manufacturer's instructions. The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause mortality, all stroke, and rehospitalisation at 1 year, tested for non-inferiority using a Bayesian approach. The primary analysis was performed in the intention-to-treat population and sensitivity analyses were done in the implanted population. The non-inferiority margin was 8·0%. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03735667, and is ongoing.
FINDINGS: Between June 10, 2019, and April 19, 2023, 1500 patients were recruited, of whom 752 were randomly assigned to the ACURATE neo2 group and 748 to the control group. The median age of participants was 79 years (IQR 74-83). 778 (51·9%) of 1500 patients were female and 721 (48·1%) were male. At 1 year, the posterior median probability of the primary composite endpoint was higher in the ACURATE neo2 group (16·2% [95% Bayesian credible interval 13·4-19·1) than in the control group (9·5% [7·5-11·9]; between-group difference 6·6% [3·0-10·2]). The upper bound of treatment difference exceeded the prespecified non-inferiority margin of 8%, with a posterior probability of treatment difference of >0·999. At 1 year, the ACURATE neo2 group, had significantly higher Kaplan-Meier rates of the composite endpoint of all-cause mortality, all stroke, and rehospitalisation (14·8% [95% CI 12·5-17·6] vs 9·1% [7·2-11·4]; hazard ratio [HR] 1·71 [95% CI 1·26-2·33]; p=0·0005). At 1 year, all-cause mortality occurred in 36 of 752 patients in the ACURATE neo2 group versus 28 of 748 patients in the control group (HR 1·30 [95% CI 0·80-2·14]), stroke in 41 patients versus 25 patients (1·68 [1·02-2·75]), and rehospitalisation in 38 patients versus 25 patients (1·57 [0·95-2·61]). Cardiovascular mortality (3·7% vs 1·8%, p=0·024) and spontaneous myocardial infarction at 1 year (2·4% vs 0·7%, p=0·0092) were more frequent in the ACURATE neo2 group than in the control group. Prosthetic valve aortic regurgitation (central plus paravalvular) at 1 year was significantly more frequent in the ACURATE neo2 group than in the control group (mild aortic regurgitation 42·5% vs 24·8%, p<0·0001; moderate 4·4% vs 1·8%, p=0·0070; severe 0·5% vs 0%; p=0·12).
INTERPRETATION: In patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis, TAVR with ACURATE neo2 did not meet non-inferiority and resulted in significantly worse outcomes with respect to the primary endpoint of composite of all-cause mortality, all stroke, and rehospitalisation at 1 year when compared with commercial valves.

The accurate assessment of RV function is however limited by the presence of concomitant tricuspid regurgitation (TR). Implantation of a novel transcatheter tricuspid valve device in this case highlights the importance of recognizing these limitations, and the need to define alternative ways to measure RV systolic function, contextualized to pulmonary pressure in patients with severe TR. It also demonstrates the clinical potential of perforation of the pop-off zone in this prosthesis, to create mild residual TR, thereby reducing the increase in RV afterload of this intervention, and its impact on RV systolic function.","['Hannah Kempton', 'Mayooran Namasivayam', 'Thomas Meredith', 'Martin Shaw', 'Paul Jansz', 'David W M Muller']",JACC.

Ventricular dysfunction, splanchnic overload, renal failure, and liver congestion contribute to its morbi-mortality. The most common etiology of TR is secondary to right atrial or ventricular dilatation. The TRI-SCORE, a risk score assessing the intrahospital mortality of isolated TR surgery, should be available in the heart team discussion. Surgical valve repair improves survival with low or intermediate TRI-SCORE, but not with high TRI-SCORE. Transcatheter repair and replacement showed TR reduction and improved life quality scores, but without differences in death or heart failure hospitalizations. TR intervention should be performed before the disease is too advanced (low or intermediate TRI-SCORE).
La prévalence de l’insuffisance tricuspide (IT) augmente avec l’âge et le sexe féminin. La dysfonction ventriculaire, l’insuffisance rénale et la congestion hépatique contribuent à sa morbimortalité.

Le TRI-SCORE, score de risque pour évaluer la mortalité intrahospitalière d’une chirurgie isolée de l’IT, devrait être utilisé lors de heart team. La chirurgie de réparation valvulaire améliore la survie lorsque le TRI-SCORE est bas ou intermédiaire.

40388090,Advances in Clinical Cardiology 2024: A Summary of Key Clinical Trials.,"INTRODUCTION: In 2024, numerous key clinical trials in the field of clinical cardiology have been published or presented at major international conferences. This review seeks to collate and summarise these trials and reflect on their clinical context.
METHODS: The authors evaluated all clinical trials presented at major cardiology conferences during 2024 with a focus on clinical trials which would influence and/or change current clinical practice. We reviewed clinical trials presented at all major international conferences including the American College of Cardiology (ACC), European Association for Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions (EuroPCR), European Society of Cardiology (ESC), Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics (TCT), American Heart Association (AHA), European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA), Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI), TVT-The Heart Summit (TVT) and Cardiovascular Research Technologies (CRT). Trials considered to have highest impact and/or broad relevance across the field of clinical cardiology, with a high likelihood to change or impact upon clinical practice were included.
RESULTS: Over 90 key cardiology clinical trials were identified across the spectrum of clinical cardiology. Important updates in percutaneous coronary intervention were reviewed including new ESC guidance and several key trials in the field of coronary physiology (FAVOR III), drug-coated balloons (REGCAGE-FREE, AGENT-IDE), shock, and acute coronary syndromes (SENIOR-RITA, DanGer-Shock). Structural trials included major updates in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) from EARLY-TAVR, TAVR-UNLOAD and NOTION 3, as well as seminal trials in tricuspid (TRISCEND II) and mitral intervention (MATTERHORN). Key updates in preventative cardiology included new data in lipoprotein (a) pharmacotherapy, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol reduction and hypertension management (BPROAD, BedMed, KRAKEN), as well as several key trials in heart failure (SUMMIT, FINEARTS) hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (SEQUOIA-HCM) and cardiac amyloid (HELIOS-B).
CONCLUSION: The review presents a concise summary of the key clinical cardiology trials published or presented during the past year and should be of interest to clinicians and researchers in the field of cardiology.","['Patrick Savage', 'Michael Campbell', 'Meadhbh Hogg', 'Daniel McElhatton', 'Ian Menown']",Advances in therapy,2025-05-19,10.1007/s12325-025-03220-9,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12325-025-03220-9,PMC11213809,Free,Advances in Clinical Cardiology 2024 A Summary of Key Clinical Trials SAVAGE 2025,pdfs\Advances in Clinical Cardiology 2024 A Summary of Key Clinical Trials SAVAGE 2025.pdf,"['Clinical Trials', 'Key Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Cardiology', 'Cardiology', 'clinical trials presented', 'Clinical', 'cardiology clinical trials', 'clinical cardiology trials', 'Trials', 'Heart Rhythm Association']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['Acute coronary syndromes', 'Cardiology', 'Clinical trials', 'Electrophysiology', 'Heart failure', 'Intervention', 'Prevention', 'Structural']"
40366146,Minimally Invasive Tricuspid Valve Surgery: An Alternative Surgical Approach in the Era of Transcatheter Interventions.,"There has been significant growth in minimally invasive valve surgery over the past 2 decades, with novel approaches including video-assisted minithoracotomy, totally endoscopic, and robotic assisted. Outcomes of these techniques suggest that they can improve patient-reported outcomes, enhance mobility, reduce blood loss, and facilitate earlier discharge and return to work. Minimally invasive tricuspid valve surgery now provides surgeons and patients with an alternative option for treating tricuspid valve disease. These operations can be conducted safely and yield favorable outcomes with carefully selected patients. Herein, we provide a comprehensive overview of minimally invasive tricuspid valve surgery, including a summary of the current literature on minithoracotomy valve repair or replacement, beating heart, redo, and multiple-valve surgery. Finally, we contextualize how minimally invasive tricuspid valve surgery can play an important role in the era of emerging transcatheter strategies.","['Ali Fatehi Hassanabad', 'Angela Kim', 'Daniyil Svystonyuk', 'Gianluigi Bisleri', 'Corey Adams', 'William D T Kent']",Cardiology in review,2025-05-14,10.1097/CRD.0000000000000951,https://doi.org/10.1097/CRD.0000000000000951,,Paid,Minimally Invasive Tricuspid Valve Surgery An Alternative Surgical Approach in the Era of Transcatheter Interventions HASSANABAD 2025,Not available,"['Alternative Surgical Approach', 'Surgical Approach', 'Invasive Tricuspid Valve', 'Minimally Invasive Tricuspid', 'Tricuspid Valve Surgery', 'Tricuspid Valve', 'Invasive Tricuspid', 'Alternative Surgical', 'Minimally Invasive', 'Transcatheter Interventions']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['minimally invasive cardiac surgery', 'minimally invasive tricuspid valve surgery', 'tricuspid valve disease', 'tricuspid valve surgery']"

However, currently, available commercial bioprosthetic heart valves prepared from glutaraldehyde (GA)-crosslinked xenografts have limited durability because of various factors, including severe cytotoxicity, inflammatory response, poor pro-endothelialization ability and calcification. Therefore, the development of valve materials with better performance is urgent. In this work, we first synthesized Cu-doped carbon dots (CuCDs) with excellent biocompatibility and high stability using sodium citrate, ethylenediamine and copper chloride. Subsequently, oxidized chondroitin sulfate (OCS) was used to crosslink the decellularized bovine pericardium to obtain OCS-BP followed by loading CuCDs onto the surface of this OCS-fixed BP sample through amide bonds formed by an EDC/NHS-catalyzed reaction between the functional groups on CuCDs and OCS-BP to prepare the BHV (CuCDs-OCS-BP) with specific properties. Relevant experiments conducted both in vivo and in vitro indicate that CuCDs-OCS-BP with good stability showed improved mechanical properties, compliance and flexibility, encouraging HUVEC-cytocompatibility, excellent anti-blood cell adhesion, antithrombogenic properties, anti-inflammatory and anti-calcification properties, and a good endothelialisation ability due to the catalytic generation of endogenous nitric oxide. Overall, CuCDs-OCS-BP is a promising material for BHVs.","['Shubin Shi', 'Xu Wei', 'Xu Peng', 'Xinyun Pu', 'Shaoxiong Feng', 'Xi Gao', 'Xixun Yu']",Journal of materials chemistry.

Following the PRISMA guidelines, we included both non-randomized studies and randomized clinical trials that reported AKI criteria and patients' surgical risk in patients with aortic stenosis by searching PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science until late September. We executed a random-effects model in Review Manager to pool effect estimates of AKI incidence or the need for dialysis as an odds ratio (OR) and I2 heterogeneity, and we utilized R for meta-regression to address any heterogeneity with subgroup analysis for surgical risk, AKI criteria, and study design. We used the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS) and the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool (RoB-1) for risk of bias assessment and GRADE for certainty assessment. Involving 17 studies and a total of 13,777 patients, we found that the AKI incidence was significantly lower in TAVR compared to SAVR (OR = 0.36; 95% CI: [0.30, 0.44], I2 = 55%, P = 0.003), along with the need for dialysis (OR = 0.35; 95% CI: [0.19, 0.63], I2 = 0%, P = 0.92). The study also found that intermediate and low-risk patients had more favorable outcomes. However, the retrospective study design and VARC-2 criteria were associated with unfavorable outcomes. TAVR effectively reduced the risk of AKI in all surgical risk categories and the need for dialysis compared to SAVR in patients with AS.","['Ahmad Alazzam', 'Yacoub Aldroubi', 'Tariq Alhusban', 'Mosab Said']",Cardiovascular intervention and therapeutics,2025-05-27,10.1007/s12928-025-01144-3,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12928-025-01144-3,PMC8054375,Free,Comprehensive analysis of acute kidney injury incidence following transcatheter versus surgical aortic valve replacement in aortic stenosis a systematic review and meta analysis of 13 777 patients ALAZZAM 2025,pdfs\Comprehensive analysis of acute kidney injury incidence following transcatheter versus surgical aortic valve replacement in aortic stenosis .pdf,"['acute kidney injury', 'TAVI', 'surgical aortic valve', 'aortic valve', 'aortic valve replacement', 'patients', 'Cardiovascular Intervention Society', 'valve', 'British Cardiovascular Intervention', 'transcatheter aortic valve']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['AKI', 'Dialysis', 'Meta-analysis', 'SAVR', 'TAVI', 'TAVR']"
40422955,One-Year Outcome of Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement with Concomitant SignificantTricuspid Regurgitation.,"Background: The outcome of patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) can be affected by coexisting tricuspid regurgitation (TR). The aim of the study is to investigate the clinical results of patients undergoing TAVR with or without concomitant significant TR. Methods: Patients undergoing TAVR were divided into two groups according to TR severity: none/mild TR (low-grade) and moderate/severe TR (significant). Data were analysed and compared. Primary endpoint was the mortality 1-year. Secondary endpoints were re-hospitalization and the degree of postoperative and 1-year TR. Results: TAVR procedures were performed in 345 patients between September 2011 and February 2020. Median STS score was 4.3% (IQR: 2.6-7.2), median LVEF was 59.0% (IQR: 45.0-62.0), median aortic area was 0.70cm2 (IQR: 0.60-0.86), median mean gradient was 43.0mmHg (IQR: 36.0-53.0). Before TAVR, 297 patients (86.1%) had low-grade TR and 48 (13.9%) significant TR. Mean age was 82.4 ± 5.7 and 83.8 ± 6.2 years in low-grade and significant TR group, respectively (p = 0.109), with 47.5% (low-grade TR) and 56.3% (significant TR) of female patients (p = 0.279). Patients showed differences in EuroSCORE-II (3.2% (IQR: 1.9-5.7) in low-grade TR vs. 5.6% (IQR: 3.7-8.1) in significant TR; p < 0.001), impaired right ventricular function (3.0% vs. 20.8%; p < 0.001) and pulmonary hypertension (9.1% vs. 39.6%; p < 0.001). Mean valve size was 27.7 ± 2.9 mm. Hospital mortality was 2.0% in low-grade TR and 4.2% in significantTR patients (p = 0.308). Among discharged patients (n = 337), seven patients died within 30 days (2.0% low-grade TR; 2.1% significant TR; logrank test p = 0.154) and 40 were re-hospitalized for heart failure (11.1% low-grade TR; 14.6% significant TR; p = 0.470). After one year, 26 patients died, corresponding to a mortality of 7.9 deaths per 100-person year (95% CI 5.2-12.0) in low-grade TR group and 9.1 deaths per 100-person year (95% CI 3.4-24.3) in significant TR group (logrank test p = 0.815), with HR (low grade vs. significant TR) of 0.87, 95% CI 0.26-2.89. Re-hospitalization for heart failure was 16.5% and 19.6% for low-grade and significant TR, respectively (p = 0.713). Echocardiographic and functional changes over time showed no significant interaction between TR and time. Conclusions: In our experience, patients undergoing TAVR showed similar 30-day and 1-year outcome and re-hospitalization rate, regardless of the degree of concomitant tricuspid regurgitation.","['Enrico Ferrari', 'Alberto Pozzoli', 'Catherine Klersy', 'Elena Caporali', 'Stefanos Demertzis', 'Giovanni Pedrazzini']",Journal of cardiovascular development and disease,2025-05-14,10.3390/jcdd12050184,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcdd12050184,,Paid,One Year Outcome of Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement with Concomitant SignificantTricuspid Regurgitation FERRARI 2025,Not available,"['Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'patients undergoing TAVR', 'Patients Undergoing Transcatheter', 'Patients Undergoing', 'undergoing TAVR', 'Concomitant SignificantTricuspid Regurgitation', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'Undergoing Transcatheter']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['aortic valve stenosis', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement', 'tricuspid valve regurgitation']"

40421696,Effectiveness and Safety of Myval Versus Other Transcatheter Valves in Patients Undergoing TAVI: A Meta-Analysis.,"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has changed the treatment of aortic stenosis. The Myval transcatheter heart valve (THV), a novel balloon-expandable THV, has shown promising outcomes. Our aim is to compare the comparative safety and effectiveness of Myval THV against established THVs, such as Sapien and Evolut. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted, comparing the Myval THV with other contemporary THVs. Primary endpoints were periprocedural, 30-day and 1-year all-cause mortality. Seven studies involving 3106 patients (1027 Myval; 2079 other THVs) were included. No significant differences were observed in the primary endpoints. Myval demonstrated higher procedural success (RR: 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01-1.07, I² = 29%) and lower rates of permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI) during the index hospitalization (RR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.36-0.92, I² = 23%) and 30-days (RR: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.40-0.89, I² = 43%), compared to other THV. At 30-day, Myval was associated with lower rates of moderate or severe transvalvular aortic regurgitation (RR: 0.33, 95% CI: 0.11-0.98, I² = 57%) and minor vascular complications (RR: 0.45, 95% CI: 0.23-0.90, I² = 0%). When compared to self-expandable THV, Myval was associated with higher procedural and device success, higher early safety, lower risk for PPI, minor vascular complications and at least moderate transvalvular AR. When compared to Sapien, procedural success and risk for in-hospital PPI was borderline higher and lower in favor of Myval, respectively. The Myval THV demonstrates comparable safety and effectiveness to contemporary THVs, with advantages in procedural success, PPI, and vascular complications.","['Anastasios Apostolos', 'Nikolaos Ktenopoulos', 'Maria Drakopoulou', 'Alfonso Ielasi', 'Vasileios Panoulas', 'Andreas Baumbach', 'Konstantinos Tsioufis', 'Patrick Serruys', 'Konstantinos Toutouzas']",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,2025-05-27,10.1002/ccd.31611,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.31611,,Paid,Effectiveness and Safety of Myval Versus Other Transcatheter Valves in Patients Undergoing TAVI A Meta Analysis APOSTOLOS 2025,Not available,"['Patients Undergoing TAVI', 'Undergoing TAVI', 'Myval Versus', 'Myval', 'Myval THV', 'Patients Undergoing', 'THV', 'Myval transcatheter heart', 'TAVI', 'Transcatheter aortic valve']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['TAVR', 'aortic valve', 'balloon‐expandable', 'self‐expandable', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study on a cohort of consecutive patients who underwent TAVR utilizing Myval THV from September 2021 to August 2023 at a tertiary care cardiac center. We collected baseline characteristics, pre- and post-procedural echocardiographic findings, procedural details, in-hospital outcomes, VARC-3 technical success, and complications. Additionally, patients were followed up for 3 months concerning their clinical outcomes.
RESULTS: The study population comprised 92 TAVR patients with a mean age of 76.8 ± 7.3 years, 66.3% were male, and the mean STS score was 5.9 ± 3.2%. The most common valve sizes used were 24.5 mm (30.4%), 23 mm (26.1%), and 27.5 mm (17.4%). Pre-dilation was performed in 32 cases (34.8%), achieving a 93.5% technical success rate. In-hospital mortality occurred in three patients (3.3%), which included one annulus rupture. Permanent pacemaker implantation was required in six patients (6.5%). Three patients (3.3%) exhibited 3+ paravalvular leakage demonstrated by angiography. The New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class showed significant improvement from baseline to discharge (p < 0.0001). At the 3-month follow-up, five patients encountered mortality (5.4), and three experienced an episode of stroke or transient ischemic attack (3.2%).

The relationship between malnutrition and post-TAVR ischemic stroke remains unclear. This study investigates this association using the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) data.
METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted using NIS data from 2012 to 2021. We included patients who underwent TAVR and were diagnosed with malnutrition based on ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes. Patients under 18 years, with a history of preoperative stroke, with both ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, or with incomplete data were excluded. Logistic regression was performed to evaluate the association between malnutrition and ischemic stroke, adjusting for potential confounders. Sensitivity analyses included stratified analysis and propensity score matching.
RESULTS: Among 364,580 TAVR patients, 10,415 (2.86%) were diagnosed with malnutrition. Malnourished patients were older (78.04 vs. 77.40), predominantly white (85.69%), and had a higher incidence of ischemic stroke (11.47% vs. 7.25%, p < 0.001). After adjusting for common ischemic stroke risk factors, malnutrition was significantly associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke (aOR: 1.51; 95% CI: 1.31-1.74). This association remained significant in the propensity-matched cohort. Subgroup analyses consistently showed associations between malnutrition and stroke risk across various demographic and clinical factors. Time trend analysis showed no significant difference in the annual incidence of perioperative ischemic stroke between malnourished patients with or without cerebral embolic protection devices (p = 0.439).
CONCLUSION: Malnutrition is associated with a higher risk of ischemic stroke following TAVR, highlighting the need for targeted interventions.","['Haowei Li', 'Guangzhi Cong', 'Xueping Ma', 'Bo Shi', 'Congyan Ye', 'Rui Yan', 'Shizhe Fu', 'Kairu Wang', 'Shaobin Jia', 'Jingjing Wang']",Health science reports,2025-05-27,10.1002/hsr2.70860,https://doi.org/10.1002/hsr2.70860,PMC12104818,Free,The Impact of Malnutrition on Perioperative Ischemic Stroke in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement TAVR A Retrospective Cohort Study of the National Inpatient Sample LI 2025,pdfs\The Impact of Malnutrition on Perioperative Ischemic Stroke in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement TAVR A Retrospective Cohort Study of t.pdf,"['Ischemic Stroke', 'Ningxia Medical University', 'TAVR', 'TAVR ischemic stroke', 'National Inpatient Sample', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Ischemic', 'Stroke', 'Ningxia Medical', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['cerebral embolic protection', 'ischemic stroke', 'malnutrition', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"
40417940,An evaluation of the SavvyWire as a support wire for TAVR procedures.,"Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) represents a minimally invasive alternative for the treatment of severe symptomatic aortic stenosis and is increasingly adopted in younger and lower-risk patients. A support guidewire placed in the left ventricle is required in all TAVR procedures, and rapid ventricular pacing is frequently used to ensure valve implant stability. Also, recent studies showed a correlation between post-TAVR hemodynamic gradients and clinical outcomes, underscoring the importance of accurate invasive measurements. The SavvyWire™ (Opsens Medical) is a novel support guidewire designed for TAVR procedures that integrates left ventricular pacing and invasive pressure measurement capabilities, enabling continuous hemodynamic monitoring and simplifying the procedure. This review outlines the SavvyWire's™ design features and summarizes clinical evidence supporting its use in TAVR procedures.
What is this article about?This Device Evaluation article focuses on the new transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) support guidewire, the SavvyWire™ (Opsens Medical), an innovative solution that, besides providing proper support for the TAVR procedure, features integrated dedicated ventricular pacing capabilities and a built-in pressure sensor in its distal tip. These functionalities allow its use for rapid pacing for valve implantation and intraprocedural invasive transvalvular assessment, thereby streamlining TAVR procedures and clinical decision-making processes.What were the results?The safety and efficacy of the SavvyWire™ have been demonstrated inthree prospective observational TAVR studies, with effective left ventricular rapid pacing and accurate pressure recordings in the vast majority of cases. Additionally, the support provided by the SavvyWire was comparable to or superior than that of other TAVR workhorse support wires.What do the results of the study mean?This novel TAVR support guidewire can provide safe and effective rapid pacing for valve implantation and accurate direct transvalvular hemodynamic measurements. These additional features make this guidewire an appealing option during TAVR since it can simplify the procedure and help to optimize procedural results.","['Julio I Farjat-Pasos', 'Marisa Avvedimento', 'Josep Rodes-Cabau']",Future cardiology,2025-05-26,10.1080/14796678.2025.2509458,https://doi.org/10.1080/14796678.2025.2509458,,Paid,An evaluation of the SavvyWire as a support wire for TAVR procedures FARJAT-PASOS 2025,Not available,"['TAVR procedures', 'TAVR', 'TAVR support guidewire', 'Opsens Medical', 'support', 'support guidewire', 'pacing', 'SavvyWire', 'procedures', 'ventricular pacing']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['Transcatheter aortic valve replacement', 'innovation', 'invasive hemodynamics', 'left ventricle pacing', 'support guidewire']"
40417790,Impact of Left Ventricular Diastolic Pressure Changes on Clinical Outcomes After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.,"UNLABELLED: Changes in left ventricular (LV) diastolic pressure after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) or their relationship with subsequent outcomes remain poorly clarified. Accordingly, we aimed to assess the changes in invasively measured LV diastolic pressure and their relationship with long-term outcomes in patients undergoing TAVR.
METHODS: In total, 509 patients with severe aortic stenosis who underwent TAVR at 3 tertiary centers were retrospectively included and divided into 2 groups according to changes in LV pre-A pressure after TAVR: Group 1, with no change or decrease in pre-A pressure, and Group 2, presenting an increase in pre-A pressure after TAVR. The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause death and rehospitalization for heart failure.
RESULTS: Group 1 included 39% (n=198) patients, and Group 2 had 61% (n=311) patients. More patients in Group 2 had diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and a larger aortic valve area than in Group 1. During the follow-up period (median, 28 months), 122 primary outcomes were recorded. In Kaplan-Meier analysis, the cumulative incidence of the primary outcome and all-cause death was significantly lower in Group 1 than in Group 2. In multivariable Cox hazard models, Group 1 was independently associated with a favorable primary outcome (hazard ratio, 0.52 [95% CI, 0.34-0.80]; P=0.003).
CONCLUSIONS: Increase in LV pre-A pressure after TAVR is common, and no change or decrease in LV pre-A pressure after TAVR is independently associated with favorable outcomes. Changes in LV pre-A pressure can help identify patient subsets who will maximally benefit from TAVR.","['Jiwon Seo', 'Ah-Ram Kim', 'Iksung Cho', 'Chi Young Shim', 'Geu-Ru Hong', 'Eui-Young Choi', 'Se-Joong Rim', 'Young-Guk Ko', 'Myeong-Ki Hong', 'Jae-Kwan Song', 'Jong-Won Ha']",Journal of the American Heart Association,2025-05-26,10.1161/JAHA.124.039372,https://doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.124.039372,,Paid,Impact of Left Ventricular Diastolic Pressure Changes on Clinical Outcomes After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement SEO 2025,Not available,"['Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Left Ventricular Diastolic', 'Ventricular Diastolic Pressure', 'Left Ventricular', 'pre-A pressure', 'Valve Replacement', 'Diastolic Pressure', 'Aortic Valve', 'TAVR']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['aortic stenosis', 'diastolic function', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"
40415983,A Retrospective Analysis Assessing Paravalvular Leak and Pacemaker Implantation Using TEE and Non-Contrast CT for CKD Patients Compared With CT Angiography for Annular Sizing Pre-TAVR.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become the treatment of choice for many patients with severe aortic stenosis. Proper pre-procedure sizing of the aortic annulus is crucial in preventing post-TAVR complications. This is typically performed with CT angiography, but the use of contrast is controversial in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).
METHODS: This study of 557 patients from 2016 to 2021 sought to evaluate a contrast-sparing protocol for balloon expandable TAVR evaluation in patients with CKD, in which patients with glomerular filtration rate of less than 40 would undergo transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) and CT without contrast (83 patients) for aortic annular sizing instead of CT angiography (445 patients).
RESULTS: We found that there was no significant difference in rates of greater than trace or greater than mild paravalvular leak between the two groups at hospital discharge, 30 days, or 1-year post-TAVR. We also found no difference in rates of permanent pacemaker implantation at these same time points.
CONCLUSIONS: This suggests that TEE and non-contrast CT could be a viable alternative to CTA in patients with CKD, although more research into other variables such as mortality and other post-procedural complications is necessary.","[""Michael O'Shaughnessy"", 'Roxana Tabrizi', 'Derek Pham', 'Nicholas Jackson', 'Olcay Aksoy', 'Andre Akhondi', 'Jeanne Huchting', 'Richard Shemin', 'Murray Kwon', 'Peyman Benharash', 'Brandon Kim', 'Amir Rabbani']",Health science reports,2025-05-27,10.1002/hsr2.70847,https://doi.org/10.1002/hsr2.70847,PMC12098966,Free,A Retrospective Analysis Assessing Paravalvular Leak and Pacemaker Implantation Using TEE and Non Contrast CT for CKD Patients Compared With CT Angiography for Annular Sizing Pre TAVR O'SHAUGHNESSY 2025,pdfs\A Retrospective Analysis Assessing Paravalvular Leak and Pacemaker Implantation Using TEE and Non Contrast CT for CKD Patients Compared With.pdf,"['Patients', 'TAVR', 'TEE', 'David Geffen School', 'Annular Sizing', 'CKD Patients Compared', 'contrast', 'Los Angeles', 'Paravalvular Leak', 'aortic annular sizing']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['TAVR', 'aortic stenosis', 'pacemaker implantation', 'paravalvular leak', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"
40414547,Balancing cost and care: analyzing commercial pricing for TAVR and SAVR.,"In a nationwide examination of commercial prices for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR), we observed substantial markups and variability across hospitals, payers and plan types-including differences exceeding $90,000 among insurers. Higher prices did not consistently correlate with better clinical outcomes, suggesting that factors beyond quality of care drive these pricing differences. These findings underscore the need for greater transparency and further investigation into how pricing structures and market forces affect both cost and quality of care.","['Chen Wei', 'Pranav Sharma', 'Ishan Paranjpe', 'Paul A Heidenreich', 'Kevin Schulman', 'Alexander Sandhu']",American heart journal,2025-05-23,10.1016/j.ahj.2025.05.011,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ahj.2025.05.011,,Paid,Balancing cost and care analyzing commercial pricing for TAVR and SAVR WEI 2025,Not available,"['aortic valve replacement', 'analyzing commercial pricing', 'analyzing commercial', 'valve replacement', 'Balancing cost', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'surgical aortic valve', 'aortic valve', 'SAVR', 'TAVR and SAVR']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['Price transparency', 'SAVR', 'TAVR', 'healthcare spending', 'price variation']"
40412426,"ACURATE neo2 valve versus commercially available transcatheter heart valves in patients with severe aortic stenosis (ACURATE IDE): a multicentre, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial.","BACKGROUND: ACURATE neo2 is an open-cell, supra-annular, self-expanding transcatheter heart valve that is commercially available in over 50 countries but has not previously been evaluated in a randomised trial. ACURATE-IDE aimed to prospectively evaluate the safety and efficacy of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with the ACURATE neo2 valve compared with commercially available valves for the treatment of severe symptomatic aortic stenosis.
METHODS: In this multicentre, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial, patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis and any level of surgical risk were recruited from 71 medical centres in the USA and Canada. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to TAVR with ACURATE neo2 or one of the control valves, SAPIEN 3 (SAPIEN 3 or SAPIEN 3 Ultra) or Evolut, using permuted block randomisation with a pseudo-random number generator, and stratified by the clinical investigation site and type of control valve. All devices were implanted according to the manufacturer's instructions. The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause mortality, all stroke, and rehospitalisation at 1 year, tested for non-inferiority using a Bayesian approach. The primary analysis was performed in the intention-to-treat population and sensitivity analyses were done in the implanted population. The non-inferiority margin was 8·0%. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03735667, and is ongoing.
FINDINGS: Between June 10, 2019, and April 19, 2023, 1500 patients were recruited, of whom 752 were randomly assigned to the ACURATE neo2 group and 748 to the control group. The median age of participants was 79 years (IQR 74-83). 778 (51·9%) of 1500 patients were female and 721 (48·1%) were male. At 1 year, the posterior median probability of the primary composite endpoint was higher in the ACURATE neo2 group (16·2% [95% Bayesian credible interval 13·4-19·1) than in the control group (9·5% [7·5-11·9]; between-group difference 6·6% [3·0-10·2]). The upper bound of treatment difference exceeded the prespecified non-inferiority margin of 8%, with a posterior probability of treatment difference of >0·999. At 1 year, the ACURATE neo2 group, had significantly higher Kaplan-Meier rates of the composite endpoint of all-cause mortality, all stroke, and rehospitalisation (14·8% [95% CI 12·5-17·6] vs 9·1% [7·2-11·4]; hazard ratio [HR] 1·71 [95% CI 1·26-2·33]; p=0·0005). At 1 year, all-cause mortality occurred in 36 of 752 patients in the ACURATE neo2 group versus 28 of 748 patients in the control group (HR 1·30 [95% CI 0·80-2·14]), stroke in 41 patients versus 25 patients (1·68 [1·02-2·75]), and rehospitalisation in 38 patients versus 25 patients (1·57 [0·95-2·61]). Cardiovascular mortality (3·7% vs 1·8%, p=0·024) and spontaneous myocardial infarction at 1 year (2·4% vs 0·7%, p=0·0092) were more frequent in the ACURATE neo2 group than in the control group. Prosthetic valve aortic regurgitation (central plus paravalvular) at 1 year was significantly more frequent in the ACURATE neo2 group than in the control group (mild aortic regurgitation 42·5% vs 24·8%, p<0·0001; moderate 4·4% vs 1·8%, p=0·0070; severe 0·5% vs 0%; p=0·12).
INTERPRETATION: In patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis, TAVR with ACURATE neo2 did not meet non-inferiority and resulted in significantly worse outcomes with respect to the primary endpoint of composite of all-cause mortality, all stroke, and rehospitalisation at 1 year when compared with commercial valves.

40410432,Efficacy and safety of transfemoral TAVR in pure aortic regurgitation patients: a single center study.,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) via the femoral approach in patients with pure aortic regurgitation (AR), with a focus on mortality, adverse event rates, cardiac function, and clinical symptom improvement. The study utilised a single-centre experience to provide insights and offer guidance for the management of TAVR in AR patients. Patients with aortic valve pathology who underwent TAVR at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, from January 2018 to March 2023 were enrolled. They were classified into two groups: pure AR and aortic stenosis (AS) based on preoperative transthoracic echocardiography. We compared baseline characteristics, imaging data, surgical outcomes, and follow-up conditions between them. We focused on the safety and efficacy of TAVR in patients with AR and evaluated these results using regression analysis. The study cohort comprised 87 patients, with 21 in the AR group and 63 in the AS group. We revealed that AR patients exhibited low mortality and adverse event rates following transfemoral TAVR, with notable improvements in postoperative cardiac function and substantial symptom relief. However, the rates of paravalvular leak (PVL), permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation, and valve-in-valve procedures were relatively elevated. While these findings suggest that TAVR may represent a viable therapeutic option for patients with AR, the elevated rates of PVL, PPM implantation, and readmission underscore the need for further investigation, with larger cohorts and extended follow-up, to more robustly evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of this approach.","['Jie Feng', 'Haixia Wei', 'Shiyuan Zhang', 'Yao Li', 'Hangyu Liu', 'Yanqing Wu']",Scientific reports,2025-05-23,10.1038/s41598-025-03214-1,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-03214-1,PMC12102353,Free,Efficacy and safety of transfemoral TAVR in pure aortic regurgitation patients a single center study FENG 2025,pdfs\Efficacy and safety of transfemoral TAVR in pure aortic regurgitation patients a single center study FENG 2025.pdf,"['TAVR', 'aortic valve', 'aortic', 'patients', 'valve', 'transfemoral TAVR', 'aortic regurgitation patients', 'pure aortic regurgitation', 'Affiliated Hospital', 'aortic valve replacement']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['Aortic regurgitation', 'Aortic stenosis', 'Perivalvular leakage', 'TAVR']"

CASE SUMMARY: An 81-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis and peripheral arterial disease (kissing iliac stents) presented for TAVR. Mild resistance was encountered when introducing the 14-F TAVR catheter through an 18-F sheath, but the catheter passed with gentle pressure. While the catheter was advancing up the aorta, a large, calcified mass was seen moving with the distal tip. Retraction of the catheter also retracted the seemingly attached calcific mass. Angiography revealed a catheter-induced avulsed atheroma but no perforation.
DISCUSSION: The TAVR delivery catheter was carefully removed, and the calcific lesion settled infrarenally. Kissing iliac stenting was performed, raising the aortic bifurcation to the juxtarenal aorta and covering the mobile plaque. Angiography showed patent stents with excellent distal aortic and lower extremity runoff.
TAKE-HOME MESSAGES: Although rare, aortic complications can be devastating. Here, emergency multidisciplinary assistance was critical for a successful endovascular result.","['Sumon Roy', 'Alexis Lauria', 'Rohan Kalathiya', 'James Black', 'Ramon Riojas', 'Hooman Bakhshi', 'Matthew Czarny']",JACC.

40408797,Impact of Noncoaxial Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation on Clinical Outcomes.,"BACKGROUND: Noncoaxial placement of transcatheter heart valves (THVs) relative to the native aortic annulus is occasionally detected on fluoroscopy after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the impact of noncoaxial TAVR deployment on clinical outcomes.
METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated consecutive patients undergoing transfemoral TAVR in the Bern transcatheter aortic valve implantation registry. Coaxiality between the native annulus and the THV was measured using the 3-cusp view on fluoroscopic images and was defined as the angle between a line intersecting the lower points of native cusps and a line intersecting the lower hinge points of the prosthesis frame. Patients were categorized according to tertiles of coaxiality.
RESULTS: Among 2,025 patients (mean age 81.6 ± 6.5 years, mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality 4.2% ± 3.3%) undergoing TAVR with contemporary devices between February 2014 and June 2023, the mean axial angulation of the device relative to the native annulus was 4.1°. According to Valve Academic Research Consortium-3 criteria, patients in the highest tertile of THV axial angle (range, 4.8-21.7°) had reduced device early safety (56.2% vs 82.7%; aHR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.59-0.76; P < 0.001) and higher rates of stage-2 bioprosthetic valve failure at 1-year follow-up (1.5% vs 0.7%; HR: 3.47; 95% CI: 1.26-9.54; P = 0.016), compared to those with coaxial valve positioning (range, 0.1-3.0). Left ventricle outflow tract calcium volume, predilatation, and valve type were independent predictors of noncoaxial valve implantation.
CONCLUSIONS: Noncoaxial THV deployment is associated with impaired valve early safety and increased risk of bioprosthetic valve failure 1 year after TAVR.","['Domenico Angellotti', 'Marc Pfluger', 'Annette Maznyczka', 'Daijiro Tomii', 'Masaaki Nakase', 'Stefan Stortecky', 'Jonas Lanz', 'Daryoush Samim', 'David Reineke', 'Fabien Praz', 'Stephan Windecker', 'Thomas Pilgrim']",JACC.

40402169,Long-term results of transcatheter aortic valve replacement in degenerated surgical aortic valves-a propensity score matched analysis.,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to analyse long-term valve function and all-cause mortality of patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) due to degenerated surgical aortic valve (SAV) bioprostheses.
METHODS: In this single-center study, all consecutive patients undergoing TAVR between December 2012 and December 2020 were included. Long-term echocardiographic results, functional status and 5-year all-cause mortality were analysed in patients with TAV-in-SAV and native valve TAVR in a propensity score matched analysis.
RESULTS: Out of 3423 patients who were eligible for the study, 136 experienced bioprosthetic valve dysfunction, whereas 3287 patients underwent native valve TAVR. After 2:1 propensity score matching, baseline characteristics without relation to prior SAVR were comparable between both groups. Regarding 5-year all-cause mortality, no difference was observed between patients with prior SAVR and native valve TAVR, in either unadjusted analysis, or after propensity score matching (corresponding hazard ratio: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.70-1.30, p = 0.75). In addition, while pressure gradients were higher in patients with TAV-in-SAV in long-term echocardiographic follow-up, moderate or severe hemodynamic valve deterioration did not occur more often in this group.

40401761,Economic option value associated with surgical aortic valve replacement using a novel bioprosthetic and a future transcatheter aortic valve-in-valve procedure.,"INTRODUCTION: Optimal lifetime management of surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) patients should account for the expected clinical and economic value of the index procedure as well as the future trajectory of health outcomes. This study estimates the discounted per surgery ""total value"" (from the time of initial SAVR operation through 25 years post-surgery) and the option value (after reoperation) that mechanical SAVR patients forego by choosing a device that does not allow for valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve reoperation (ViV/TAVR).
METHODS: The model adopts a US payer perspective and tracks major health events, anti-coagulant monitoring, maintenance, and expenditures associated with these events following initial SAVR procedures, inclusive of costs before and after a potential reoperation. We compare the expected utilization and expenditures for tissue valve patients and mechanical valve patients over a 25-year period. The model also compares the experience of mechanical SAVR patients after reoperation to a counterfactual group receiving ViV/TAVR to estimate option value. Monte Carlo simulation, sensitivity analyses, scenario analyses, and break-even analyses were conducted to account for variation in inputs.
RESULTS: Novel SAVR treatment for aortic stenosis followed by ViV TAVR for reoperation reduces 25-year payer expenditures relative to mechanical valves by either $34,621 (95% CI: 17,426-52,218), $31,363 (95% CI: $19,871 -$43,399) or $23,303 (95% CI: $16,906-$30,075) depending on the age of initial SAVR operation. During this period, the ""option value"" share of overall savings ranges from 8-17% and generally is lower for older patients. Reoperation and anti-coagulant monitoring are important drivers of overall savings and option value.
CONCLUSION: The deterministic and simulation models both demonstrate that novel SAVR tissue valves, followed by a ViV/TAVR, result in lower 25-year expected costs than a treatment strategy using mechanical SAVR valves, and option value is a component of these savings.","['Eric L Keuffel', 'Matt Reifenberger', 'Andrew Pellegrini', 'Pradeep Yadav', 'Vinod H Thourani']",Journal of medical economics,2025-12-27,10.1080/13696998.2025.2503664,https://doi.org/10.1080/13696998.2025.2503664,,Paid,Economic option value associated with surgical aortic valve replacement using a novel bioprosthetic and a future transcatheter aortic valve in valve procedure KEUFFEL 2025,Not available,"['surgical aortic valve', 'aortic valve replacement', 'SAVR', 'mechanical SAVR patients', 'initial SAVR', 'mechanical SAVR', 'initial SAVR operation', 'aortic valve', 'initial SAVR procedures', 'mechanical SAVR valves']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['I10', 'I11', 'I18', 'RESILIA', 'Surgical aortic valve replacement', 'bioprosthetic aortic valve', 'health economics', 'option value', 'outcomes research']"
40398959,Survival and cause of death after isolated primary aortic valve replacement at Oslo University Hospital (2012-2021): a retrospective registry-based study.,"BACKGROUND: The treatment of aortic valve disease has changed following the introduction of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Hence, the selection of patients for surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR) is changing. Thus, we aimed to study survival and causes of death following surgical AVR at a large Scandinavian Centre in the period 2012-21.
METHODS: Information about the surgical procedure, survival and cause of death was obtained from the National Norwegian Health Registries. The latest clinical information about the deceased patients was made available from the local hospitals and examined to evaluate the causes of death from The Norwegian Cause of Death Registry.
RESULTS: From 2012 to 2021, the number of surgical implantations of aortic valve bioprostheses (AVR(b)) and patient age at the time of surgery decreased. Outcomes were excellent, with 30-day survival of 98.6% following AVR(b) and 99.8% following AVR(m). 1-year survival after AVR(b) improved from 96.4% in the first half to 98.4% in the second half of the study period, probably due to a reduction of operative risk during the study period. Non-cardiovascular mortality was the most frequent cause of death, followed by cancer, cardiovascular and valve-related death. Deaths due to cerebral bleeding or stroke were the least frequent with 10-year estimators of 1.3% and 1.6% following AVR(m) and AVR(b), respectively. The inter-rater reliability between The Norwegian Cause of Death Registry and the journal information provided was moderate, with an unweighted Cohen's kappa of 0.56 (0.47-0.64).
CONCLUSIONS: Valve-related death and death from cerebral bleeding or stroke was rare after surgical AVR. Survival was high and improved during the study period.

OBJECTIVE: To assess whether cipepofol outperforms propofol in maintaining postinduction hemodynamic stability in patients with AS.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This single-center, randomized clinical trial was conducted from June 29, 2023, to July 8, 2024, at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine in China. Patients with AS scheduled for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) were eligible for inclusion.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either cipepofol or propofol as anesthesia induction agents at equipotent doses.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the area under the curve (AUC) of the mean arterial pressure (MAP) difference from baseline during the initial 15 minutes postinduction.
RESULTS: A total of 124 patients with AS scheduled for TAVR were randomized into either the cipepofol group (n = 62) or the propofol group (n = 62). Of 124 patients randomized, 1 patient from each group was excluded due to ineligibility for the TAVR procedure, and data were analyzed for 122 patients (61 patients per group) based on the intention-to-treat principle. Among 122 total patients, mean (SD) age was 72.2 (5.0) years, and 53 patients (43.4%) were female. The cipepofol group exhibited a significantly smaller median (IQR) AUC (-8505.0 mm Hg · s [-12 402.8 to -5130.0]) compared with the propofol group (-13 189.0 mm Hg · s [-17 006.7 to -7593.3]; P < .001). Moreover, compared with the propofol group, the cipepofol group demonstrated a significantly lower incidence of postinduction hypotension (70.5% vs 88.5%; P = .01) and required a smaller median (IQR) dose of norepinephrine during the first 15 minutes postinduction (6.0 μg [0.0-10.0] vs 10.0 μg [5.0-20.0]; P = .006). Additionally, the 2 groups' bispectral indices were comparable.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, cipepofol provided superior hemodynamic stability as an induction agent compared to propofol at equipotent doses and similar anesthesia depths for patients with AS. Therefore, cipepofol could serve as an alternative induction agent to propofol for patients at high cardiovascular risk.

40396898,Continued Versus Interrupted Oral Anticoagulation During Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation: A Meta-Analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: A substantial number of patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) require long-term oral anticoagulants (OAC) owing to comorbidities. This study examined whether continuing oral anticoagulation periprocedurally during TAVR is as safe and effective as interrupting it.
METHODS: A systematic search of the major databases was performed to identify relevant studies. Effect estimates were calculated using risk ratios (RR) and 95% CIs by pooling the data using the inverse-variance random effects model. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.
RESULTS: Four studies were included, with 2962 patients undergoing TAVR with continued OAC (n = 1318) and interrupted OAC (n = 1644). The pooled analysis demonstrated that TAVR with continued OAC had comparable risks for all-cause mortality (RR: 0.91; 95% CI, 0.62-1.34; P = 0.64), cardiovascular mortality (RR: 0.89; 95% CI, 0.43-1.84; P = 0.76), stroke (RR: 0.67; 95% CI, 0.42-1.08; P = 0.09), closure device failure (RR: 0.86; 95% CI, 0.47-1.59; P = 0.64), major/life-threatening bleeding (RR: 0.93; 95% CI, 0.74-1.15; P = 0.49), and major vascular complications (RR: 0.97; 95% CI, 0.79-1.20; P = 0.80) compared with TAVR with interrupted OAC.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing TAVR, continued OAC showed comparable safety and efficacy with interrupted OAC. These findings demonstrate that continuing OAC in the periprocedural period may be a viable option in patients with atrial fibrillation because of comorbidities requiring anticoagulants.","['Hritvik Jain', 'Nandan Patel', 'Muhammad Daoud Tariq', 'Ali Saad Al-Shammari', 'Rozi Khan', 'Jyoti Jain', 'Rahul Patel', 'Faizan Ahmed', 'Raheel Ahmed', 'Thomas Alexander']",American journal of therapeutics,2025-05-21,10.1097/MJT.0000000000001979,https://doi.org/10.1097/MJT.0000000000001979,,Paid,Continued Versus Interrupted Oral Anticoagulation During Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation A Meta Analysis JAIN 2025,Not available,"['Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Versus Interrupted Oral', 'Aortic Valve', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'Valve Replacement', 'undergoing transcatheter aortic', 'Continued Versus Interrupted', 'Versus Interrupted', 'Oral Anticoagulation']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['TAVR', 'anticoagulation', 'aortic stenosis', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"
40396229,Feasibility of Computed Tomography as a Gatekeeper for Invasive Angiography Before TAVR: A Pragmatic Real-World Experience.,"BACKGROUND: Although pretranscatheter aortic valve replacement-computed tomography angiography (TAVR-CTA) has shown a good correlation with invasive coronary angiography (ICA) for ruling out obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD), its clinical effectiveness and safety as a gatekeeper for ICA pre-transcatheter aortic valve replacement (pre-TAVR) remain unclear. This study aims to determine whether routine TAVR-CTA, without premedication, could safely defer and guide the need for ICA pre-TAVR.
METHODS: Patients who underwent TAVR evaluation with either TAVR-CTA or ICA to determine CAD between 2017 and 2022 were included. Patients with prior coronary artery bypass grafts were excluded, and the remaining patients were divided into CAD screening with TAVR-CTA or ICA groups. The primary outcome was symptom-driven revascularization at 1 year post-TAVR.
RESULTS: Among 1165 patients (median age, 81 years; 46% women), 464 were in TAVR-CTA group and 701 were in the ICA group. Prevalence of CAD was similar (37% versus 41%; P=0.2). A total of 53% of patients were exempted from ICA after TAVR-CTA, given the absence of proximal obstructive CAD, whereas 17% had inconclusive TAVR-CTA interpretation, 15% desired for ICA despite CAD exclusion by TAVR-CTA, and 14% had obstructive CAD requiring further ICA. Elevated coronary artery calcium score and the presence of stents were associated with need for ICA after TAVR-CTA. TAVR-CTA revealed a per-patient sensitivity of 89%, specificity of 75%, positive predictive value of 69%, and negative predictive value of 91% for identifying obstructive CAD. Importantly, symptom-driven revascularization, acute coronary syndrome, and unplanned ICA at 1 year after TAVR were all low and not different between TAVR-CTA versus ICA (0.8% versus 1.8%, P=0.158; 1.6% versus 1.7%, P=0.846; 2.7% versus 2.8%, P=0.767; respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: In comparison with routine ICA pre-TAVR, integration of TAVR-CTA in our program resulted in up to 53% of patients exempted from ICA, while maintaining patient safety. This approach could have important clinical implications to improve patient access, experience, value, and throughput.","['Asa Phichaphop', 'Paul Sorajja', 'Maurice Enriquez-Sarano', 'Miho Fukui', 'Atsushi Okada', 'Davide Margonato', 'Mohammed Abed', 'Takahiro Nishihara', 'Hideki Koike', 'Evan Walser-Kuntz', 'John R Lesser', 'Victor Y Cheng', 'Vinayak N Bapat', 'Nadira Hamid', 'João L Cavalcante']",Circulation.

40396187,A Case of Treatment With a Combination of Covered Stents and Artificial Blood Vessel for Iliac Artery Rupture During Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.,"Vascular complications (VCs) associated with Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR), particularly iliac artery rupture, pose significant challenges. We report a case of complete iliac artery disruption during TAVR. A combination of a covered stent and artificial blood vessel repair was employed to achieve revascularization of the iliac artery. In this case, the patient was placed on bed rest for 10 days to avoid stent dislodgement due to early movement and was discharged from the hospital 13 days later. After that, the patient stayed away from significant lower limb activity for 3 months after surgery and underwent enhanced follow-up. Regular follow-up indicated that the patient recovered well, with no significant discomfort in the right lower limb and consistent pulse in the dorsal foot artery on both sides. The treatment of such complications typically involves surgical intervention, while this method shows a new viable option for managing such VCs. By using this method, blood flow can be blocked more quickly than through surgery, which reduced the risk of massive bleeding, death, and limb loss and improved the prognosis.","['Wensheng Zhu', 'Hanqing Deng', 'Weiqing Hu', 'Shixun Wang']",Clinical case reports,2025-05-27,10.1002/ccr3.70523,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccr3.70523,PMC12090355,Free,A Case of Treatment With a Combination of Covered Stents and Artificial Blood Vessel for Iliac Artery Rupture During Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement ZHU 2025,pdfs\A Case of Treatment With a Combination of Covered Stents and Artificial Blood Vessel for Iliac Artery Rupture During Transcatheter Aortic Va.pdf,"['Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Aortic Valve', 'Valve Replacement', 'Clinical Case Reports', 'Iliac Artery Rupture', 'Iliac Artery', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'Artificial Blood Vessel', 'Artery']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['aortic stenosis', 'artery reconstruction', 'iliac artery rupture', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement', 'vascular complication']"
40394980,Valve-in-Valve TAVR for Degenerated Surgical Valves in Patients With Small Aortic Annuli: A Report From a Japanese Nationwide Registry.,"BACKGROUND: Valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve replacement (ViV-TAVR) provides an alternative treatment for high-risk patients with failed surgical bioprosthetic aortic valves. However, limited data exist on ViV-TAVR outcomes in patients with small aortic annuli, particularly among the relatively small-statured Japanese population.
METHODS: We analyzed data from the J-TVT (Japan Transcatheter Valve Therapy) registry, which included all TAVR institutions across Japan, with data collected from July 2018, when ViV-TAVR was approved, through December 2022. A small aortic annulus was defined as an aortic annulus area of ≤314 mm², measured using preoperative computed tomography for ViV-TAVR. Prosthesis-patient mismatch (PPM) was defined as an indexed effective orifice area <0.85 cm²/m², assessed using echocardiography within 30 days after ViV-TAVR. The composite endpoint was evaluated at 30 days and 1 year.
RESULTS: Among 47 800 individuals, 1029 underwent ViV-TAVR, resulting in a final sample of 405 patients. The mean indexed effective orifice area was 0.83 cm²/m² in the small annulus group (n=225) and 0.94 cm²/m² in the nonsmall group (n=180), with PPM rates of 59.2% and 44.4%, respectively. Small annuli were independently associated with PPM (hazard ratio, 1.9 [95% CI, 1.26-2.87]; P=0.002). No differences in 30-day and 1-year outcomes were observed between groups. Among the 225 patients with small annuli, the mean indexed effective orifice area was 0.76 cm2/m2 in the balloon-expandable valve group (n=61) and 0.86 cm2/m2 in the supraannular self-expanding valve group (n=164), with PPM rates of 67.2% and 56.1%, respectively. No differences in outcomes were noted based on the type of valve implanted.
CONCLUSIONS: ViV-TAVR for small aortic annuli in Japanese patients was associated with an increased risk of PPM; however, no differences in clinical outcomes were observed according to aortic annulus size or valve type. Due to the small size of our sample, further research is required to validate these findings.","['Yusuke Oba', 'Hiraku Kumamaru', 'Satoshi Hoshide', 'Shun Kohsaka', 'Kazuo Shimamura', 'Yohei Ohno', 'Masafumi Sato', 'Hisaya Kobayashi', 'Hiroshi Funayama', 'Kenji Harada', 'Koji Kawahito', 'Kazuomi Kario']",Circulation.

40393868,Anxiety during transcatheter aortic valve replacement under local anesthesia - the ART-VR trial.,"BACKGROUND: The use of local anesthesia during transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) could result in patient discomfort. Application of immersive virtual reality (VR) during TAVR might distract the patient and enhance the overall experience.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of an immersive VR environment on periprocedural anxiety and patient discomfort, compared to standard of care in patients undergoing transfemoral (TF) TAVR under local anesthesia.
METHODS: In this single-center, randomized controlled pilot study, patients were randomized to either VR immersion during TAVR or standard of care. The intervention was a VR headset to create 3D experiences during percutaneous transfemoral TAVR. The main outcome was patient-reported procedural anxiety assessed directly after the procedure on a visual analog scale (VAS). Secondary outcomes were procedural satisfaction, pain, and change in anxiety. Personality scores were obtained at baseline to explore associations between personality types and relevant outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 75 patients (VR = 37, control = 38) were included between September 2021 and January 2023. The median age was 79 (25th-75th: 75-84) years and 32 patients (43 %) were female. Overall procedural anxiety VAS was 1.0 (0.0-3.0) and satisfaction was 9.0 (8.0-10.0). There was no difference in procedural anxiety between VR and control (VAS: 1.0 [25th-75th: 0.0-3.0] versus 1.0 [25th-75th: 0.0-3.0], p = 0.59). Procedural satisfaction, pain perception and change in anxiety were not affected by VR use.
CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing TF-TAVR under local anesthesia experienced mild procedural anxiety and high satisfaction levels. Procedural VR use did not affect procedural anxiety or pain perception.","['Sraman Chatterjee', 'Joris Ooms', 'Marjo de Ronde', 'Stefan van Gorsel', 'Antonio Maarten Mattace-Raso', 'Jeannette Goudzwaard', 'Francesco Mattace-Raso', 'Isabella Kardys', 'Rutger-Jan Nuis', 'Joost Daemen', 'Nicolas Van Mieghem']",Cardiovascular revascularization medicine : including molecular interventions,2025-05-15,10.1016/j.carrev.2025.05.015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.carrev.2025.05.015,,Paid,Anxiety during transcatheter aortic valve replacement under local anesthesia the ART VR trial CHATTERJEE 2025,Not available,"['transcatheter aortic valve', 'aortic valve replacement', 'local anesthesia', 'transcatheter aortic', 'aortic valve', 'TAVR', 'valve replacement', 'Anxiety', 'ART-VR trial', 'procedural']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['Anesthesia', 'Anxiety', 'Pain', 'TAVR', 'VR']"
40391859,Impact of Periprocedural Statin Therapy on Mortality and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: A Meta-Analysis and Meta-Regression.,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) stands as a notable alternative to surgical valve replacement for severe aortic stenosis (AS). Despite the established benefits of statins in cardiovascular pathologies, their specific impact in patients with severe AS undergoing TAVR remains uncertain.
AIMS: Our meta-analysis aims to assess whether periprocedural statin therapy improves survival and outcomes post-TAVR, thus addressing this gap in literature.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search using various databases with relevant keywords terms was conducted to identify studies on the impact of periprocedural statin therapy on TAVR outcomes. We assessed the primary outcome of all-cause mortality alongside various secondary outcomes including stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA), myocardial infarction, acute kidney injury (AKI), 30-day mortality, in-hospital mortality, rehospitalization, cardiovascular complications, and pacemaker requirement. A random-effects model using Comprehensive Meta Analysis Software was employed to analyze the data for each outcome. Statistical significance was set at a p < 0.05.
RESULTS: Our analysis of 19 observational studies revealed that periprocedural statin therapy significantly reduces all-cause mortality following TAVR surgery (OR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.61-0.83, p < 0.001). However, the influence of statins on other outcomes remains inconclusive. These outcomes include stroke/TIA (OR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.68-1.19, p = 0.455), risk of MI (OR = 1.72, 95% CI: 0.73-4.04, p = 0.214), AKI (OR = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.75-1.31, p = 0.968), 30-day mortality (OR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.46-1.10, p = 0.126), in-hospital mortality (OR = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.13-1.38, p = 0.151), rehospitalization (OR = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.66-1.29, p = 0.645), cardiovascular complications (OR = 1.12, 95% CI: 0.91-1.37, p = 0.297), and pacemaker requirement (OR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.65-1.06, p = 0.133).
CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis indicates a potentially promising role for periprocedural statin therapy in enhancing patient outcomes post-TAVR surgery. We found a notable association between statin therapy and a reduction in all-cause mortality. However, the effects on secondary outcomes did not reach statistical significance, which warrants further investigation through larger, well-designed, randomized controlled trials.","['Aman Goyal', 'Surabhi Maheshwari', 'Yusra Mashkoor', 'Ajeet Singh', 'Faryal Rafique', 'Abu Baker Sheikh', 'Kamna Bansal']",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,2025-05-20,10.1002/ccd.31607,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.31607,,Paid,Impact of Periprocedural Statin Therapy on Mortality and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement A Meta Analysis and Meta Regression GOYAL 2025,Not available,"['Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Valve Replacement', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'Periprocedural Statin Therapy', 'Aortic Valve', 'surgical valve replacement', 'Statin Therapy', 'Periprocedural Statin', 'Statin']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['TAVI', 'TAVR', 'cardiology', 'complications', 'meta‐analysis', 'mortality', 'statins', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"
40388768,Heyde syndrome: Experiences with the use of semiautomatic vWF multimer analysis for diagnosis and TAVI for treatment - case report.,"RATIONALE: Aortic stenosis (AS) is currently the most frequent valve disorder. In addition, the angiodysplasias are the most common vascular malformations of the gastrointestinal tract. Heyde syndrome (HS) is a rare disease which links these 2 pathological conditions.
PATIENT CONCERNS: Currently, there are no clearly defined guidelines for the confirmation of HS diagnosis and for timing of aortic valve replacement in patients with confirmed HS, despite the fact that HS is connected with increased mortality and the need for numerous rehospitalizations and multiple blood transfusions. Therefore, the aim of this study was to report (our) first experiences with novel diagnostic method for acquired von Willebrand (vW) syndrome and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for treatment of HS.
DIAGNOSES: We report a case of a 68-year-old man who was diagnosed with HS with the use of semiautomatic vW factor multimer analysis.
INTERVENTIONS: A successful TAVR was used for treatment of AS.
OUTCOMES: After the interventional treatment of AS, the patient did not have a recurrence of the anemic syndrome.
LESSONS: This is a unique case of a patient with HS in whom semiautomatic vW factor multimer analysis was used for diagnosis of acquired vW syndrome together with TAVR procedure for HS treatment.","['Boris Focko', 'Zuzana Miertová', 'Ingrid Škorňová', 'Martin Hudec', 'Martin Jozef Péč', 'Jakub Jurica', 'Marek Cingel', 'Tomáš Bolek', 'Juraj Sokol', 'Petra Poliačiková', 'Marián Mokáň', 'Matej Samoš']",Medicine,2025-05-16,10.1097/MD.0000000000042486,https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000042486,PMC12091634,Free,Heyde syndrome Experiences with the use of semiautomatic vWF multimer analysis for diagnosis and TAVI for treatment case report FOCKO 2025,pdfs\Heyde syndrome Experiences with the use of semiautomatic vWF multimer analysis for diagnosis and TAVI for treatment case report FOCKO 2025.p.pdf,"['acquired von Willebrand', 'aortic valve', 'aortic valve replacement', 'von Willebrand syndrome', 'von Willebrand', 'multimer analysis', 'vWF multimer analysis', 'University Hospital Martin', 'factor multimer analysis', 'transcatheter aortic valve']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['Heyde syndrome', 'acquired von Willebrand syndrome', 'aortic stenosis', 'semiautomatic von Willebrand factor multimer analysis']"
40388090,Advances in Clinical Cardiology 2024: A Summary of Key Clinical Trials.,"INTRODUCTION: In 2024, numerous key clinical trials in the field of clinical cardiology have been published or presented at major international conferences. This review seeks to collate and summarise these trials and reflect on their clinical context.
METHODS: The authors evaluated all clinical trials presented at major cardiology conferences during 2024 with a focus on clinical trials which would influence and/or change current clinical practice. We reviewed clinical trials presented at all major international conferences including the American College of Cardiology (ACC), European Association for Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions (EuroPCR), European Society of Cardiology (ESC), Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics (TCT), American Heart Association (AHA), European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA), Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI), TVT-The Heart Summit (TVT) and Cardiovascular Research Technologies (CRT). Trials considered to have highest impact and/or broad relevance across the field of clinical cardiology, with a high likelihood to change or impact upon clinical practice were included.
RESULTS: Over 90 key cardiology clinical trials were identified across the spectrum of clinical cardiology. Important updates in percutaneous coronary intervention were reviewed including new ESC guidance and several key trials in the field of coronary physiology (FAVOR III), drug-coated balloons (REGCAGE-FREE, AGENT-IDE), shock, and acute coronary syndromes (SENIOR-RITA, DanGer-Shock). Structural trials included major updates in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) from EARLY-TAVR, TAVR-UNLOAD and NOTION 3, as well as seminal trials in tricuspid (TRISCEND II) and mitral intervention (MATTERHORN). Key updates in preventative cardiology included new data in lipoprotein (a) pharmacotherapy, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol reduction and hypertension management (BPROAD, BedMed, KRAKEN), as well as several key trials in heart failure (SUMMIT, FINEARTS) hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (SEQUOIA-HCM) and cardiac amyloid (HELIOS-B).

40383183,The safety and feasibility of same day discharge for patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Next day discharge (NDD) after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has been shown to be safe in appropriately selected patients and has since been implemented into clinical practice. As the demand for TAVR grows, improving its accessibility is crucial. Several studies have trialled same day discharge (SDD) after TAVR, but a review has not been performed.
METHODS: Five databases were searched. Baseline demographics, study characteristics and the assessment criteria used to determine eligibility for SDD were extracted and compared. Proportional meta-analysis was used to compare post-TAVI outcomes between SDD and NDD patients.
RESULTS: Six studies were included from 1734 screened articles. Of 3519 patients, 318 (9.0%) underwent SDD (mean age 78.2 ± 8.7 years; 59.3% male). Balloon-expanding valves were used in 91.6% of cases, and self-expanding valves in the remaining 8.4%. Patients that underwent SDD experienced lower rates of mortality (OR 0.104, 95% CI: 0.015 - 0.998), all-cause readmission (OR 0.194, 95% CI 0.052 - 0.717), cardiovascular readmissions (OR 0.155, 95% CI 0.026 - 0.971), and new pacemaker requirement (OR 0.167, 95% 0.028 - 0.995) at 30 days after TAVR, compared to patients that underwent NDD. There was no difference in rates of stroke (OR 0.407, 95% CI: 0.015 - 16.694) or major vascular complications (0.0% vs 0.0%).
CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence supports the safety and feasibility of SDD after elective, transfemoral TAVR in appropriately selected patients. Heterogeneity between eligibility criteria used to select patients for SDD, especially related to conduction disease, poses a barrier to implementation. Further research on self-expanding valves is needed.","['Princess Neila Litkouhi', 'Karan Rao', 'Alexandra Baer', 'Peter S Hansen', 'Ravinay Bhindi']",The Canadian journal of cardiology,2025-05-16,10.1016/j.cjca.2025.05.007,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2025.05.007,,Paid,The safety and feasibility of same day discharge for patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement a systematic review and meta analysis LITKOUHI 2025,Not available,"['aortic valve replacement', 'undergoing transcatheter aortic', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'transcatheter aortic', 'day discharge', 'SDD', 'TAVR', 'patients undergoing transcatheter', 'valve replacement', 'patients']",2025-05-27,Pending,[]
40382742,Transcatheter Versus Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement in Patients with Polyvascular Disease.,"INTRODUCTION: There is a paucity of data regarding the trends and comparative outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) versus surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) among patients with polyvascular disease (PVD).
METHODS: The Nationwide Readmissions Database (2016-2020) was queried for patients undergoing AVR. Propensity score matching was used to compare the outcomes of TAVR versus SAVR among patients with PVD, and for comparing TAVR among those with versus without PVD. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality.
RESULTS: The final cohort included 545,409 hospitalizations for AVR. During the study years, there was an increase in the utilization of TAVR versus SAVR among patients with PVD. Patients with PVD undergoing TAVR were older and more likely to be women compared with patients with PVD undergoing SAVR. Compared with SAVR, patients with PVD undergoing TAVR had lower odds of in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.26; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19-0.35), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, and major bleeding, but higher odds of pacemaker and non-elective 90-day readmissions (aOR 1.13; 95% CI 1.01-1.26). TAVR among patients with versus without PVD showed similar in-hospital mortality (aOR 1.10; 95% CI 0.94-1.20), while there were higher odds of AMI, ischemic stroke, and vascular complications after TAVR in patients with PVD. A higher burden of atherosclerotic vascular beds conferred higher mortality with SAVR more than with TAVR, while a higher burden of atherosclerotic vascular beds conferred a higher risk of ischemic stroke and readmissions after both TAVR and SAVR.
CONCLUSIONS: Nationwide data demonstrated that patients with PVD who undergo TAVR were associated with lower in-hospital mortality and major cardiovascular complications compared with those who undergo SAVR. Patients with PVD have similar mortality to those with no PVD undergoing TAVR, but were associated with a higher risk for complications and readmission.
The Nationwide Readmissions Database (2016–2020) was queried for patients undergoing aortic valve replacement AVR (n = 545,409). There was an increase in the utilization of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in favor of surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) among patients with polyvascular disease. Patients with polyvascular disease undergoing TAVR had lower odds of in-hospital mortality, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, and major bleeding compared with SAVR, but higher odds of pacemaker and non-elective 90-day readmissions. TAVR among patients with versus without polyvascular disease showed similar in-hospital mortality, while there were higher odds of myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and vascular complications after TAVR in patients with polyvascular disease. A higher burden of atherosclerotic vascular beds conferred higher mortality with SAVR than with TAVR.","['Abdelrhman Abomoawad', 'Ramy Sedhom', 'Harsh Golwala', 'Mohamed Abdelazeem', 'Mamas Mamas', 'Hani Jneid', 'Anthony A Bavry', 'Dharam J Kumbhani', 'Samir Kapadia', 'Ayman Elbadawi']",Cardiology and therapy,2025-05-18,10.1007/s40119-025-00415-7,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40119-025-00415-7,PMC10806851,Paid,Transcatheter Versus Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement in Patients with Polyvascular Disease ABOMOAWAD 2025,Not downloaded,"['PVD undergoing TAVR', 'TAVR versus SAVR', 'TAVR', 'patients with PVD', 'PVD', 'Patients', 'Surgical Aortic Valve', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'SAVR', 'PVD undergoing']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['Aortic stenosis', 'Aortic valve replacement', 'Polyvascular disease']"
40379374,Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Severe Horizontal Heart With Acute Aortic Angulation.,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become a first-line treatment for elderly patients with severe aortic stenosis since its first successful implementation in 2002. However, performing TAVR in patients with extreme horizontal heart orientation and acute aortic angulation is technically challenging and carries higher procedural risks.
CASE SUMMARY: This case report describes a patient with severe aortic stenosis complicated by an extreme horizontal heart position and acute aortic angulation. Under the support of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), femoral artery long sheaths, and snare traction, the TAVR procedure was successfully completed.
DISCUSSION: The success of this case provides valuable insights for managing complex TAVR procedures.
TAKE-HOME MESSAGES: CPB provides critical hemodynamic support during TAVR in patients with extreme horizontal cardiac orientation, effectively preventing intraoperative circulatory collapse. Advancing a femoral artery long sheath combined with snare traction overcomes challenges when TAVR in cases of severe horizontal heart orientation and acute aortic angulation.","['Feng Liang', 'Jiaxin Zhao', 'Yiming Zhang', 'Chi Yuan', 'Bingbing Zhang', 'Jun Xie']",JACC.

The report highlights using a snare-assisted technique to navigate complex anatomical challenges.
KEY STEPS: Preoperative multimodal imaging for precise anatomical assessment. A snare-assisted delivery system navigation ensures controlled passage through the aortic arch and valve. Balloon predilation and careful valve deployment at 2 mm above the annulus. Postdeployment confirmation of valve position and coronary perfusion.
POTENTIAL PITFALLS: Risk of paravalvular leak due to severe calcification and asymmetric valve anatomy. Potential for coronary obstruction or aortic injury during valve deployment. Challenges in navigating a narrow aortic arch and aneurysmal dilation.
TAKE-HOME MESSAGE: TAVR with adjunctive techniques like snare-assisted navigation is a viable option for high-risk patients with complex BAV anatomy, emphasizing the importance of meticulous preoperative planning and precise valve positioning to minimize complications.","['Zuofeng Qin', 'Wenyi Wu', 'Sanwu Wu', 'Dong Li', 'Youen Zhang']",JACC.

40371620,Rationale and Design of the REPEAT Trial: A Multicenter Randomized Trial Comparing Redo Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement to Valve-in-Valve Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.,"BACKGROUND: Redo surgical aortic valve replacement (rSAVR) has for long been the therapeutic reference standard for degenerated surgical aortic bioprostheses. Valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve replacement (ViV-TAVR) has emerged as an alternative for patients at high surgical risk due to its lower invasiveness. The long-term clinical efficacy of ViV-TAVR in patients at low to intermediate surgical risk remains unknown.
METHODS AND RESULTS: To compare clinical outcomes of redo surgical aortic valve replacement versus ViV-TAVR in low- to intermediate-risk patients with degenerated surgical aortic bioprostheses. REPEAT (Repeat Intervention for Deteriorated Surgical Bioprosthetic Aortic Valves) is an investigator-initiated, international, multicenter, randomized, parallel, open-label trial. A total of 890 patients aged <75 years with a failed surgical aortic bioprosthesis due to structural valve degeneration and low to intermediate surgical risk (ie, Society of Thoracic Surgeons predicted risk of death of <8%) will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either redo surgical aortic valve replacement or ViV-TAVR. The primary end point of REPEAT is a composite of all-cause death, stroke (including both disabling and nondisabling), myocardial infarction, and rehospitalization for heart failure or aortic valve reintervention at 5 years, based on Valve Academic Research Consortium-3 definitions. Secondary end points include each of the individual components of the primary composite end point, Valve Academic Research Consortium-3-based conduction disturbances and arrhythmia, Valve Academic Research Consortium-3-based wound and bleeding complications, functional status (ie, 6-minute walk test, Kansas City Cardiomyopathy questionnaire), and treatment costs.
CONCLUSIONS: The REPEAT trial has been designed to test the hypothesis that redo surgical aortic valve replacement is superior to ViV-TAVR regarding clinical outcomes at 5 years in patients with degenerated surgical aortic bioprostheses and low to intermediate surgical risk.","['Matthias Raschpichler', 'Suzanne de Waha', 'Stefan Blankenberg', 'Marcio A Diniz', 'Emilia Bagiella', 'Annetine C Gelijns', 'Vinicius F Calsavara', 'Aakriti Gupta', 'Niklas Schofer', 'Tsuyoshi Kaneko', 'Mohamed Abdel-Wahab', 'Holger Thiele', 'Raj Makkar', 'Michael A Borger']",Journal of the American Heart Association,2025-05-20,10.1161/JAHA.125.040954,https://doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.125.040954,,Paid,Rationale and Design of the REPEAT Trial A Multicenter Randomized Trial Comparing Redo Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement to Valve in Valve Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement RASCHPICHLER 2025,Not available,"['Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Surgical Aortic Valve', 'Redo Surgical Aortic', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Aortic Valve', 'Surgical Aortic', 'Comparing Redo Surgical', 'Valve Academic Research', 'Valve Replacement', 'Trial Comparing Redo']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['aortic stenosis', 'failed surgical aortic bioprosthesis', 'redo surgical aortic valve replacement', 'structural valve deterioration', 'valve‐in‐valve transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"
40371611,Comparing Major Gastrointestinal Bleeding in Patients Receiving Edoxaban Versus Warfarin After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: Results From the Randomized ENVISAGE-TAVI AF Trial.,"BACKGROUND: Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants are recommended over vitamin K antagonists in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF). However, the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding may be higher with non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants versus vitamin K antagonists. Patients after successful transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) who are elderly and frail have worse outcomes with major gastrointestinal bleeding (MGIB), including death. This study evaluated incidence, predictors, and impact of MGIB among patients with AF after successful TAVR.
METHODS: This on-treatment analysis of ENVISAGE-TAVI AF (Edoxaban Compared to Standard Care After Heart Valve Replacement Using a Catheter in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation) included patients who received ≥1 dose of the study drug. Demographic, clinical, and procedural characteristics were compared between patients with versus without an MGIB event. Cox multivariable regression analysis identified predictors of MGIB.
RESULTS: Of 1377 patients in this analysis, 83 (6.0%) experienced MGIB, with 56 (67.5%) of these patients receiving edoxaban. Patients with versus without MGIB were more likely to have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention ≤30 days before TAVR (9.6% versus 4.2%; P=0.03), a higher ejection fraction (mean±SD, 58.0±10.4 versus 55.3±11.5; P=0.04), and carotid artery disease (13.3% versus 6.6%; P=0.04). Edoxaban without dose adjustment versus vitamin K antagonist use (P=0.003), smoking (P=0.01), low hemoglobin levels (P<0.0001), and percutaneous coronary intervention ≤30 days before TAVR (P=0.01) emerged as predictors of MGIB.
CONCLUSIONS: In this ENVISAGE-TAVI AF subanalysis, MGIB occurred in 6.0% of patients with prevalent or incident AF undergoing TAVR, and those receiving edoxaban versus vitamin K antagonists had a higher risk of MGIB. A priori identification of risk factors for MGIB may help optimize outcomes for patients with AF undergoing TAVR.

40370817,Valve type and post-dilation impact on transprosthetic gradients in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve-in-valve procedure.,"AIMS: Valve-in-Valve transcatheter aortic valve replacement (ViV-TAVR) is an appealing treatment option for patients with degenerated aortic bioprosthetic valves. However, higher post-procedural transprosthetic gradients are more common after ViV-TAVR than after TAVR for native aortic valve stenosis. We sought to evaluate the impact of type of implanted valve and balloon post-dilation on echocardiographic results and mortality in ViV-TAVR patients.
METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred and eleven consecutive patients were enrolled. A balloon-expandable valve, a self-expandable valve without balloon post-dilation, and a self-expandable valve with balloon post-dilation were performed in 35 (Group 1), 39 (Group 2), and 37 (Group 3) patients, respectively. All patients underwent comprehensive transthoracic echocardiography at baseline, discharge, and 6-12 months follow-up. Successful ViV-TAVR was performed in 110 patients (99%). Baseline transprosthetic gradients, left ventricular volumes, ejection fraction, and pulmonary artery systolic pressure were similar among groups. All groups experienced a significant reduction in post-procedural gradients at discharge and during the 6-12 months follow-up compared with baseline. At discharge, the lowest mean gradient was observed in Group 3 (12 ± 7 mmHg) compared with both Group 1 (20 ± 9 mmHg) and Group 2 (17 ± 8 mmHg, P = 0.001). This result was confirmed at 6-12 months follow-up (P = 0.012). Similar 5-year all-cause mortality was observed among groups (34%, 36%, 14%, respectively, P = 0.056).
CONCLUSION: In patients with failed surgical aortic prosthesis, ViV-TAVR is an effective treatment option associated with sustained improved haemodynamics regardless of transcatheter valve type and use of balloon post-dilation. However, self-expandable valves with balloon post-dilation showed lower transprosthetic gradients.","['Manuela Muratori', 'Laura Fusini', 'Gloria Tamborini', 'Paola Gripari', 'Sarah Ghulam Ali', 'Valentina Mantegazza', 'Anna Garlaschè', 'Francesco Doni', 'Andrea Baggiano', 'Francesco Cannata', 'Alberico Del Torto', 'Fabio Fazzari', 'Antonio Frappampina', 'Daniele Junod', 'Riccardo Maragna', 'Saima Mushtaq', 'Luigi Tassetti', 'Alessandra Volpe', 'Stefano Galli', 'Franco Fabbiocchi', 'Marco Gennari', 'Marco Agrifoglio', 'Antonio L Bartorelli', 'Federico De Marco', 'Mauro Pepi', 'Gianluca Pontone']",European heart journal.

40370003,Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement for Structural Valve Deterioration After Aortic Valve Neocuspidization.,"BACKGROUND: Evidence on structural valve deterioration (SVD) after aortic valve neocuspidization (AVNeo) remains limited. While transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) offers a less invasive option, its feasibility is unclear. This study aimed to characterize SVD patients post-AVNeo and to assess TAVR feasibility.
METHODS: This retrospective study included 11 patients who underwent TAVR for SVD after AVNeo in Sendai Kousei Hospital between June 2017 and August 2024. Four patients with aortic stenosis (AS) and seven with aortic regurgitation (AR) due to SVD were included.
RESULTS: AS-SVD group showed shorter time interval from AVNeo to TAVR (50.5 [28.3-98.3] vs. 107.0 [97.0-131.0] months, p = 0.04) and smaller aortic annulus area (316.5 [259.8-375.0] vs. 538.0 [440.0-582.0] mm2, p = 0.005) than AR-SVD group. In TAVR, technical success was achieved in 91% of cases. Although coronary obstruction is a concern due to the long leaflet, no case occurred. Misidentification of the basal ring plane caused by the slack cusp resulted in second valve implantation (one case) and new conduction disturbance (two cases) due to deep implantation, and aortic contained rupture (one case) for oversized valve selection.
CONCLUSIONS: Rapid AS-SVD progression and AR-SVD occurring later than previously reported were observed, highlighting the need for further studies on AVNeo durability. TAVR after AVNeo was feasible. Special precautions for coronary obstruction may be unnecessary. Careful hinge point placement at the boundary between pericardial cusps and the annulus was a key to CT-based basal ring determination in patients after AVNeo.","['Natsuko Satomi', 'Masaki Miyasaka', 'Yusuke Enta', 'Yoshiko Munehisa', 'Yusuke Toki', 'Masaki Nakashima', 'Makoto Saigan', 'Yuta Kobayashi', 'Yun Teng', 'Manabu Maeda', 'Momo Kosuga', 'Kazuo Abe', 'Masataka Taguri', 'Yukihiro Hayatsu', 'Masaki Hata', 'Norio Tada']",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,2025-05-14,10.1002/ccd.31583,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.31583,,Paid,Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement for Structural Valve Deterioration After Aortic Valve Neocuspidization SATOMI 2025,Not available,"['Structural Valve Deterioration', 'Aortic Valve Neocuspidization', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Valve Neocuspidization', 'Structural Valve', 'Valve Deterioration', 'Aortic Valve', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Valve', 'Valve Replacement']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['aortic valve neocuspidization', 'coronary obstruction', 'structural valve degeneration', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"
40367359,Impact of Device Type and Orientation on Post-Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Complications in Bicuspid Aortic Valve Patients: A Computational Study.,"Currently, no clinical modality reliably assists clinicians in selecting the optimal transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) device orientation. This is critical for the growing population of young bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) TAVR candidates, who are at high risk for post-procedural complications. We aim to develop a predictive computational modeling workflow to identify which TAVR device and orientation will minimize the risk of paravalvular leakage (PVL), coronary obstruction, and flow-induced thrombogenicity. We compared the risk of post-TAVR complications across more than 30 device orientation combinations by virtually implanting self-expandable and balloon-expandable TAVR devices in three BAV patients. PVL severity varied significantly with device orientation, reaching up to 22.03 mL/beat with certain self-expandable devices. For self-expandable devices, orientations that ensured the shortest distance between the taller skirt region and PVL regions minimized PVL. A shorter frame height in balloon-expandable devices was insufficient to cover PVL regions in certain patients. Pearson correlation demonstrated a negative relationship between device oversizing and PVL. The risk of flow-induced thrombogenicity was positively correlated with PVL severity. A patient-specific computational modeling workflow can identify the optimal TAVR device and orientation, minimizing life-threatening post-TAVR complications and facilitating future reinterventions for young BAV TAVR candidates.","['Salwa Anam', 'Brandon Kovarovic', 'Puja Parikh', 'Marvin Slepian', 'Ashraf Hamdan', 'Rami Haj-Ali', 'Danny Bluestein']",ASAIO journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs : 1992),2025-05-14,10.1097/MAT.0000000000002459,https://doi.org/10.1097/MAT.0000000000002459,,Paid,Impact of Device Type and Orientation on Post Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Complications in Bicuspid Aortic Valve Patients A Computational Study ANAM 2025,Not available,"['Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Bicuspid Aortic Valve', 'Aortic Valve', 'Post-Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Aortic Valve Patients', 'Valve Replacement Complications', 'Valve Replacement', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'Bicuspid Aortic', 'Computational Study']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['TAVR', 'bicuspid aortic valve', 'coronary obstruction', 'digital twin', 'paravalvular leakage', 'predictive computational modeling']"

PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases were searched until November 2024 for studies reporting PPI incidence within 30 days post-TAVR. A random-effect model was used to pool risk ratios (RR) and standardized mean differences (SDM) for binary and continuous risk factors. Network meta-analysis estimated pooled risk differences (ΔRR) for binary predictors with male sex as the reference. Significant predictors were ranked based on their surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) values. A total of 108 studies comprising 77,538 patients (14,560 requiring PPI) were included. Male sex (RR: 1.13), baseline atrial fibrillation (AF) (RR: 1.12), 2nd degree Mobitz I (RR: 5.16) and Mobitz II (RR: 2.30) atrioventricular blocks (AVB), 3rd degree AVB (RR: 13.46), left anterior (LAHB) (RR: 1.79) and posterior hemiblocks (LPHB) (RR: 2.57), bifascicular block (RR: 2.34), right bundle branch block (RBBB) (RR: 3.20) and intraprocedural AVB (RR: 4.15) were identified as predictors for PPI post-TAVR. The risk of PPI was higher with self-expandable valves (RR: 1.79), subclavian access (RR: 1.75), and 29 mm prostheses (RR: 1.33) compared to balloon-expandable valves, transfemoral access, and 23 mm prostheses. Network meta-analysis ranked 3rd degree AVB (SUCRA <0.01), Mobitz I AVB (SUCRA: 0.14), Mobitz II AVB (SUCRA: 0.33), intraprocedural AVB (SUCRA: 0.42), bifascicular block (SUCRA: 0.48), RBBB (SUCRA: 0.49) and LPHB (SUCRA: 0.54) as major predictors of PPI in descending order of significance. In conclusion, clinicians should closely monitor conduction abnormalities as key predictors of PPI following TAVR.

40334981,Prevalence and clinical outcomes of permanent conduction disturbances after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.,"BACKGROUND: A new-onset conduction disturbance is a major concern in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) but can resolve over time. This study aimed to evaluate the recovery in conduction disturbances post-TAVR and its association with clinical outcomes.
METHODS: This retrospective study included 780 TAVR patients at St. Marianna University between January 2016 and March 2023. Patients were stratified into four groups based on conduction status at six months post-TAVR: no conduction disturbance, recovered conduction disturbance [defined as a post-procedural pacemaker implantation with cumulative right ventricular pacing <40 % or complete left bundle branch block (CLBBB) at discharge but not at six months], permanent conduction disturbance (defined as pacemaker implantation with cumulative right ventricular pacing ≥40 % or CLBBB at both discharge and six months), and preprocedural conduction disturbance. The primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalization. The secondary outcome was the change in cardiac damage from pre-procedure to one-year post-TAVR.
RESULTS: Of 780 patients, 220 (28 %) had new-onset CLBBB or required a pacemaker implantation at discharge. Among these, 99 (45 %) had permanent conduction disturbances at six months. Over a median follow-up of 788 days, both permanent and preprocedural conduction disturbances were significantly associated with a higher incidence of heart failure hospitalization [hazard ratio (HR) 3.63; 95 % confidence interval (CI): 2.04-6.47, p < 0.01 and HR 2.50; 95 % CI: 1.27-4.90, p < 0.01), although no difference in all-cause mortality was observed. In contrast, the prognosis of patients with recovered conduction disturbance was comparable with those with no conduction disturbance. Patients with permanent and preprocedural conduction disturbances showed significant worsening cardiac damage.
CONCLUSION: Permanent and preprocedural conduction disturbances after TAVR were associated with increased heart failure hospitalizations, while the prognostic impact of recovered conduction disturbance may be limited.","['Takahiko Kai', 'Masaki Izumo', 'Masahiro Sekiguchi', 'Tetsu Tanaka', 'Taishi Okuno', 'Yukio Sato', 'Shingo Kuwata', 'Masashi Koga', 'Ikutaro Nakajima', 'Kenichi Sasaki', 'Yasuhiro Tanabe', 'Tomoo Harada', 'Yoshihiro J Akashi']",Journal of cardiology,2025-05-19,10.1016/j.jjcc.2025.04.013,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jjcc.2025.04.013,,Paid,Prevalence and clinical outcomes of permanent conduction disturbances after Transcatheter aortic valve replacement KAI 2025,Not available,"['aortic valve replacement', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'conduction disturbance', 'conduction', 'preprocedural conduction disturbances', 'valve replacement', 'preprocedural conduction', 'recovered conduction disturbance', 'permanent conduction disturbances', 'aortic valve']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['Aortic stenosis', 'Conduction disturbance', 'Transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"
40252070,Valve Dragging Technique in Valve Migration After Self-Expanding Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) may be considered for patients with symptomatic severe aortic regurgitation at high surgical risk.
CASE SUMMARY: This article presents the case of a 74-year-old man who presented with dyspnea and was diagnosed with severe aortic regurgitation. TAVR with a self-expanding valve was performed but complicated with valve migration toward the left ventricle, resulting in severe paravalvular regurgitation. Ultimately, the valve dragging technique was used to reposition the initial valve and a second valve was implanted, achieving satisfactory final outcomes.
DISCUSSION: This technique provides a novel strategy for valve migration after TAVR, avoiding surgical reintervention.
TAKE-HOME MESSAGE: The valve dragging technique is a remedial measure for severe paravalvular regurgitation secondary to valve migration after self-expanding TAVR by dragging with a second valve.","['Yinghao Sun', 'Jie Li', 'Yuan Liu', 'Jianfang Luo']",JACC.

40252068,Unusual Case of Acute Type A Aortic Dissection During TAVR Bailout With a Self-Expanding Valve.,"BACKGROUND: Over the past 2 decades, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has emerged as a widely accepted treatment for patients with severe aortic valve stenosis. Acute aortic dissection, although rare, is a life-threatening complication associated with TAVR.
CASE SUMMARY: An older man with severe aortic stenosis underwent TAVR. During valve deployment, catheter manipulation caused intimal disruption, leading to acute type A aortic dissection (TAAD). Remarkably, the dissection spontaneously sealed after prosthetic valve placement, thereby avoiding emergency surgery. A 6-month follow-up computed tomography angiography scan showed no extension of the dissection.
DISCUSSION: In the case we report, the dissection spontaneously sealed with the use of a prosthetic valve, a finding that reinforces the feasibility of nonsurgical management of iatrogenic TAAD during TAVR in select cases.
TAKE-HOME MESSAGE: The use of a biological valve offers a novel perspective on the conservative management of iatrogenic aortic dissection in high-risk patients during TAVR.","['Lianyue Ma', 'Yongfeng Liang', 'Wei Gao', 'Mei Dong', 'Xiangjuan Liu', 'Yuan Cao', 'Xiao Meng', 'Guipeng An']",JACC.

CASE SUMMARY: A 75-year-old man presented with cardiogenic shock resulting from severe AS and CAD. Emergency surgery was performed. It involved initiation of extracorporeal circulatory support, followed by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and, subsequently, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) using a TaurusElite valve (Peijia Medical). This strategy resulted in marked hemodynamic improvement.
DISCUSSION: This case highlights the efficacy and safety of concurrent PCI and TAVR as a lifesaving strategy for cardiogenic shock patients with concomitant severe CAD and AS.
TAKE-HOME MESSAGES: Emergency PCI with concurrent TAVR represents a viable lifesaving strategy for cardiogenic shock patients with coexisting severe CAD and AS.

Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is also recommended for penetrating aortic ulcer. Especially in older patients with severe AS and penetrating aortic ulcer at the same time, the surgical method brings significant risk.
CASE SUMMARY: We report a case of a 74-year-old male patient who presented with a 10-day history of dyspnea. He was diagnosed with severe AS with aortic valve insufficiency (penetrating aortic ulcer) and had multiple comorbidities. The patient underwent a 1-stop TEVAR + TAVR procedure.
DISCUSSION: The challenge was compounded by the patient's extremely narrow femoral access. This case demonstrates the 2 operations can be performed as a procedure.

CASE SUMMARY: We report successful noncoronary sinus pivot implantation (NCPI) of a 29-mm self-expanding valve in a high-risk PAR patient (Society of Thoracic Surgeons 8.2%) with extreme root dilatation and no calcification under the STABLE protocol. Post-procedure imaging confirmed hemodynamic success, no paravalvular leak, ventricular recovery, and optimal root remodeling.
DISCUSSION: This case highlights the role of annular-subannular anchoring (NCPI technique) and multimodality imaging in TAVR PAR with sinus of Valsalva aneurysm, addressing migration risks and expanding procedural feasibility beyond calcific stenosis-a critical advancement in an understudied population.

CASE SUMMARY: A 72-year-old man with type 0 BAV and sinus of Valsalva aneurysm underwent transapical J-Valve implantation for severe stenosis. Post-procedural incremental paravalvular leak (PVL) due to aneurysm-related malapposition was successfully treated with a self-expanding valve-in-valve (ViV) prosthesis (TaurusElite, 29 mm). Multimodal imaging, including echocardiography, computed tomography angiography, and 3-dimensional-printed modeling, ensured precise sealing with excellent hemodynamic results.
DISCUSSION: We report the first case of self-expanding ViV for PVL after J-Valve TAVR in type 0 BAV with aortic root aneurysm. This case underscores the feasibility of self-expanding ViV in complex BAV anatomy with concomitant aortic root pathology sighting into optimal device selection and imaging integration.

Following the PRISMA guidelines, we included both non-randomized studies and randomized clinical trials that reported AKI criteria and patients' surgical risk in patients with aortic stenosis by searching PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science until late September. We executed a random-effects model in Review Manager to pool effect estimates of AKI incidence or the need for dialysis as an odds ratio (OR) and I2 heterogeneity, and we utilized R for meta-regression to address any heterogeneity with subgroup analysis for surgical risk, AKI criteria, and study design. We used the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS) and the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool (RoB-1) for risk of bias assessment and GRADE for certainty assessment. Involving 17 studies and a total of 13,777 patients, we found that the AKI incidence was significantly lower in TAVR compared to SAVR (OR = 0.36; 95% CI: [0.30, 0.44], I2 = 55%, P = 0.003), along with the need for dialysis (OR = 0.35; 95% CI: [0.19, 0.63], I2 = 0%, P = 0.92). The study also found that intermediate and low-risk patients had more favorable outcomes. However, the retrospective study design and VARC-2 criteria were associated with unfavorable outcomes.

40421696,Effectiveness and Safety of Myval Versus Other Transcatheter Valves in Patients Undergoing TAVI: A Meta-Analysis.,"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has changed the treatment of aortic stenosis. The Myval transcatheter heart valve (THV), a novel balloon-expandable THV, has shown promising outcomes. Our aim is to compare the comparative safety and effectiveness of Myval THV against established THVs, such as Sapien and Evolut. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted, comparing the Myval THV with other contemporary THVs. Primary endpoints were periprocedural, 30-day and 1-year all-cause mortality. Seven studies involving 3106 patients (1027 Myval; 2079 other THVs) were included. No significant differences were observed in the primary endpoints. Myval demonstrated higher procedural success (RR: 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01-1.07, I² = 29%) and lower rates of permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI) during the index hospitalization (RR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.36-0.92, I² = 23%) and 30-days (RR: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.40-0.89, I² = 43%), compared to other THV. At 30-day, Myval was associated with lower rates of moderate or severe transvalvular aortic regurgitation (RR: 0.33, 95% CI: 0.11-0.98, I² = 57%) and minor vascular complications (RR: 0.45, 95% CI: 0.23-0.90, I² = 0%). When compared to self-expandable THV, Myval was associated with higher procedural and device success, higher early safety, lower risk for PPI, minor vascular complications and at least moderate transvalvular AR. When compared to Sapien, procedural success and risk for in-hospital PPI was borderline higher and lower in favor of Myval, respectively. The Myval THV demonstrates comparable safety and effectiveness to contemporary THVs, with advantages in procedural success, PPI, and vascular complications.","['Anastasios Apostolos', 'Nikolaos Ktenopoulos', 'Maria Drakopoulou', 'Alfonso Ielasi', 'Vasileios Panoulas', 'Andreas Baumbach', 'Konstantinos Tsioufis', 'Patrick Serruys', 'Konstantinos Toutouzas']",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,2025-05-27,10.1002/ccd.31611,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.31611,,Paid,Effectiveness and Safety of Myval Versus Other Transcatheter Valves in Patients Undergoing TAVI A Meta Analysis APOSTOLOS 2025,Not available,"['Patients Undergoing TAVI', 'Undergoing TAVI', 'Myval Versus', 'Myval', 'Myval THV', 'Patients Undergoing', 'THV', 'Myval transcatheter heart', 'TAVI', 'Transcatheter aortic valve']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['TAVR', 'aortic valve', 'balloon‐expandable', 'self‐expandable', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"
40420013,Two birds with one stone: pre-TAVI coronary CT angiography combined with FFR helps screen for coronary stenosis.,"OBJECTIVES: Since coronary artery disease (CAD) is a common comorbidity in patients with aortic valve stenosis, invasive coronary angiography (ICA) can be avoided if significant CAD can be screened with the non-invasive coronary CT angiography (cCTA). This study aims to evaluate the ability of machine learning-based CT coronary fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR) derived from cCTA to aid in the diagnosis of comorbid CAD in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).
METHODS: A total of 100 patients who underwent both cCTA and ICA assessments prior to TAVI procedure between January 2021 and July 2023 were included. Coronary stenosis was assessed using both cCTA data and machine learning-generated CT-FFR image information for patients/major coronary vessels. Coronary lesions with CT-FFR ≤ 0.80 were defined as hemodynamically significant, with ICA serving as the diagnostic gold standard.
RESULTS: A total of 400 major coronary vessels were identified in 100 eligible patients who underwent TAVI. CT-FFR was 86.4% sensitive and 66.1% specific to diagnose CAD, with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 66.7% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 86.0%. The diagnostic accuracy (Acc) was 75.0%, with a false positive rate (FPR) of 33.9%. At the vessel level, CT-FFR showed a sensitivity of 77.6% and a specificity of 76.9%. The PPV was 44.0% and the NPV was 93.6%. The Acc was 77.0% and the FPR was 23.1%. For all patient/vessel units, CT-FFR outperformed cCTA.
CONCLUSION: Machine learning-based CT-FFR can effectively detect coronary hemodynamic abnormalities. Combined with preoperative cCTA in TAVI patients, it is an effective tool to rule out significant CAD, reducing unnecessary coronary angiography in this high-risk population.

40418351,Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) after transcatheter aortic valve implantation in aortic stenosis patients: exploring a novel threshold for clinically significant improvement after 12 months.,"AIM: The study aimed to determine the proportion of patients with significant improvements in Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) 12 months after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI), using a threshold for physical function (PF) and physical role (RP) domains of the SF-36 questionnaire. Additionally, we explored shared baseline characteristics of patients reporting these improvements.
METHODOLOGY: In this prospective observational study, 88 patients with symptomatic, severe aortic stenosis (AS) and preserved ejection fraction were enrolled between April 2017 and February 2020. Exclusion criteria were clinical instability, pacemaker, chronic AF, comorbidities with life expectancy < 1 year. HRQoL was evaluated before and 12 months after transfemoral TAVI using the Norwegian version 2.0 of SF-36, and presented as mean (95% confidence interval). Other outcome measures were 6-minute walking test and NYHA- classification. Independent samples t-test or Mann-Whitney U test was used for between-group comparisons as appropriate. Logistic regression or Chi2-test were used to explore associations between changes in PF and RP and clinical parameters. Statistical significance was set at p ≤ 0.05, and clinically significant changes in HRQoL were defined as increase of ≥ 15 points in the PF and RP categories.
RESULTS: Mean age of the cohort was 80 ± 6 years. 44 (50%) patients reported clinically significant improvement in PF, and 46 (52%) in the RP domain. Baseline scores were significantly lower in patients reporting clinical improvement after TAVI, with PF scores pre intervention 43.07 (37.37-48.78) vs. 65.34 (59.01-71.68), p < 0.001, and RP 36.01 (29.56-42.46) vs. 59.92 (50.91-68.92), p < 0.001. No significant associations were found between improvement in domain scores and parameters from the routine baseline examination, but having ≥ 15-point improvement correlated to baseline PF and RP scores.
CONCLUSION: Our study highlights the importance of defining a uniform threshold for clinically significant improvement in the SF-36 HRQoL questionnaire for patients undergoing TAVI. Half of the patients reported favorable long-term outcome for PF and RP aspects of SF-36. This emphasizes the importance of HRQoL assessment in the preoperative work up for patients undergoing TAVI.

Severe aortic stenosis is in the elderly treated with transcatheter aortic valve implantation, aiming to improve survival and relieve symptoms. Health- related quality of life is an important outcome to measure after the procedure. However, there are no defined values for what constitutes a significant improvement in this patient group when measuring quality of life using the widely used health-related quality of life questionnaire SF-36.Our study aimed to investigate how many patients had clinically important improvement in physical aspects of quality of life one year after valve implantation. Eighty-eight patients with an average age of 80 years were included. We proposed a new threshold of 15 points for improvement in the physical function and physical role domains of the questionnaire. We found that half of the patients improved in quality of life, and those who improved had lower scores before surgery.The study emphasizes the need for a clear standard for improvement in quality of life in these patients, highlighting the value of assessment of quality of life before and after TAVI.","['Marte Sævik', 'Marit Helen Andersen', 'Jan Otto Beitnes', 'Lars Aaberge', 'Per Steinar Halvorsen']",Journal of patient-reported outcomes,2025-05-26,10.1186/s41687-025-00894-1,https://doi.org/10.1186/s41687-025-00894-1,PMC10598915,Free,Health Related Quality of Life HRQoL after transcatheter aortic valve implantation in aortic stenosis patients exploring a novel threshold for clinically significant improvement after 12 months SÆVIK 2025,pdfs\Health Related Quality of Life HRQoL after transcatheter aortic valve implantation in aortic stenosis patients exploring a novel threshold f.pdf,"['aortic valve implantation', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'Quality of Life', 'aortic valve', 'surgical aortic valve', 'aortic valve replacement', 'TAVI', 'aortic', 'valve implantation', 'Quality']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['Aortic stenosis (AS)', 'Health related quality of life (HRQoL)', 'Minimal clinically important difference (MCID)', 'SF-36', 'Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI)']"
40413055,Study protocol for an internahaational prospective non-randomised trial evaluating the long-term outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve implantation versus surgical aortic valve replacement for aortic-valve stenosis in patients at risk to severe valve obstruction: the TAVISAR trial.,"BACKGROUND: Aortic valve stenosis (AVS) represents the most prevalent primary valvular lesion necessitating surgical intervention or transcatheter intervention in Europe and North America. Its prevalence is increasing at a rapid rate as a consequence of the ageing population. A variety of mechanical interventions are available to determine the management of AVS; however, there is currently a paucity of robust data with which to perform a comparative analysis of the efficacy of surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) and that of conventional stented xenograft bioprostheses (BP) or sutureless aortic valves (SAV) and transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). The present study aims to compare the effectiveness and clinical outcomes of SAVR using BP or SAV technique and TAVI in patients with severe AVS.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A collaboration between three cardiac surgery centres across two European countries has resulted in the conception of the Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation vs Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement trial. This prospective non-randomised trial is designed to evaluate the long-term outcomes of TAVI in comparison to SAVR for AVS in patients at risk of severe valve obstruction. The registry will enrol successive patients who have undergone mechanical intervention for AVS between January 2015 and December 2025. Investigators will assess the difference between replacement procedures for both the standard surgical approach and the transcatheter procedure. The principal clinical outcome under consideration will be the composite degree of all-cause mortality, ischaemic stroke or rehospitalisation at 10 years. The present study will also have a number of secondary endpoints, including all-cause mortality, followed by functional status, hospitalisation, neurocognition, physiological measures (echocardiographic assessment), adverse events and reoperation.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: It is hypothesised that the nature of the trials will serve to minimise bias related to institutional volume and surgical experience. Each participating centre is required to have an aortic valve programme that enables proper follow-up and management of any late aortic events following replacement surgery for the AVS. The data collected will provide valuable insight into the comparative effectiveness of various surgical approaches, both standardised and advanced, in aortic valve surgery and TAVI. This comprehensive analysis will contribute significantly to the development of robust international guidelines.

40406875,Shorter Time to Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation Is Associated With Improved Outcomes in Acute Decompensated Aortic Stenosis.,"BACKGROUND: Acute decompensated aortic stenosis is an increasingly common condition associated with a high rate of morbidity, mortality, and health care resource utilization. Among patients with acute decompensated aortic stenosis, this study aimed to assess the impact of time to transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) on outcomes, hypothesizing that longer durations are associated with worse outcomes.
METHODS: Using a single-center registry, patients with their first presentation of acute decompensated aortic stenosis who underwent an urgent TAVI during their index admission were included. Time to TAVI was defined as the number of days between hospital admission and TAVI. The primary composite outcome was heart failure hospitalization or all-cause mortality. The secondary composite outcome was heart failure hospitalization or cardiovascular mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 276 patients were included in this study: age 84 (79-88) years, male sex 63.7%, patients requiring cardiopulmonary organ support 3.6%, aortic valve area 0.7 (0.5-0.8) cm2, and left ventricular ejection fraction 55 (37-57)%. Baseline characteristics were similar between patients stratified according to the median time to TAVI (22 [13-32] days). Over a follow-up of 4.6 (3.6-5.7) years, the primary and secondary outcomes occurred in 58% and 35% of patients, respectively. After adjusting for comorbidities, mean gradient, and cardiopulmonary organ support, time to TAVI was associated with both the primary (hazard ratio for every 5 days, 1.09 [95% CI, 1.04-1.16]; P=0.001) and secondary outcomes (hazard ratio for every 5 days, 1.08 [95% CI, 1.01-1.16]; P=0.023).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with acute decompensated aortic stenosis, longer time to TAVI was associated with an increased risk of adverse events at mid-term follow-up.","['Michael McKenna', 'Niromila Nadarajan', 'Sumanto Mukhopadhyay', 'Mick Ozkor', 'Thomas A Treibel', 'Guy Lloyd', 'Sanjeev Bhattacharyya', 'Anthony Mathur', 'Simon Kennon', 'Andreas Baumbach', 'Michael J Mullen', 'Kush P Patel']",Circulation.

40402187,Evolution and prognostic implications of cardiac damage in women after transcatheter aortic valve implantation.,"Recently, a cardiac damage staging system has been proposed in patients with severe AS to improve risk stratification, but there is still paucity of data in women. Accordingly, we aimed to characterize the change in cardiac damage after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), and to assess the prognostic value of cardiac damage staging in women. A total of 334 women (mean age 81 ± 7 years) with severe AS undergoing TAVI were included and retrospectively analyzed. Echocardiography was performed before and 6 months after TAVI. Patients were classified according to the following stages of cardiac damage: 0 = no damage; 1 = left ventricular damage; 2 = left atrial or mitral valve damage; 3 = pulmonary vasculature or tricuspid valve damage; and 4 = right ventricular damage. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. Most patients presented with advanced heart failure symptoms (62% in NYHA III-IV). TAVI consistently improved cardiac damage of at least one stage in 43% of patients at 6-month follow-up. During a median follow-up of 48 months, 79 patients (24%) died. Each increment of both baseline (HR per 1-stage increment 1.537, P = 0.001) and follow-up (HR per 1-stage increment 1.714, P = 0.01) cardiac damage stage were independently associated with all-cause death. Moreover, the re-assessment of cardiac damage at 6-month follow-up provided incremental prognostic value over baseline assessment (Chi-square change = 6.885; P = 0.009). TAVI has a beneficial effect on cardiac function and remodeling in women. Cardiac damage assessed before and 6 months after TAVI showed to be consistently and independently associated with prognosis.","['Rinchyenkhand Myagmardorj', 'Federico Fortuni', 'Xavier Galloo', 'Takeru Nabeta', 'Maria Chiara Meucci', 'Steele C Butcher', 'Frank van der Kley', 'Nina Ajmone Marsan', 'Jeroen J Bax']",The international journal of cardiovascular imaging,2025-05-22,10.1007/s10554-025-03424-8,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10554-025-03424-8,PMC7755038,Free,Evolution and prognostic implications of cardiac damage in women after transcatheter aortic valve implantation MYAGMARDORJ 2025,pdfs\Evolution and prognostic implications of cardiac damage in women after transcatheter aortic valve implantation MYAGMARDORJ 2025.pdf,"['cardiac damage', 'aortic valve implantation', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'cardiac damage staging', 'damage', 'cardiac', 'cardiac damage stage', 'valve damage', 'valve implantation', 'aortic valve']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['Aortic stenosis', 'Prognosis', 'Risk assessment', 'Transcatheter aortic valve implantation', 'Valvular heart disease', 'Women']"
40399991,Impact of SGLT2-inhibitors on acute kidney injury in diabetic patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).,"BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is associated with significantly worse outcomes, leading to increased short- and long-term mortality. We sought to evaluate the impact of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) on the risk of AKI in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and severe aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing TAVI.
METHODS: Multicenter international registry of consecutive T2DM patients with severe AS undergoing TAVI between 2021 and 2024. The study population was stratified by the presence of chronic kidney disease (CKD), defined according to the KDIGO guideline, and anti-diabetic therapy at hospital admission (SGLT2i versus no-SGLT2i users). AKI was defined according to the Valve Academy Research Consortium 3 (VARC-3) criteria.
RESULTS: The study population consisted of 514 patients stratified into those without CKD (n = 226, 44%), of whom 43 (19%) were treated with SGLT2i, and 288 (56%) with CKD, of whom 71 (24.7%) were on SGLT2i treatment. The median age was 81 [77-84] years, and 60.1% were males. SGLT2i use did not impact renal function in patients without CKD, with AKI occurring in 7.1% of the cases, regardless of SGLT2i use. Among CKD patients, AKI occurred more frequently in no-SGLT2i users compared to those receiving SGLT2i (19.8% versus 8.5%, p = 0.027), with a significant increase in post-TAVI and discharge serum creatinine values for no-SGLT2i users (p = 0.001 after TAVI and p < 0.001 at hospital discharge). Only in the CKD group, the use of SGLT2i was identified as an independent predictor of a lower rate of AKI (OR 0.70, 95%CI 0.42-0.91, p = 0.014). Patients who developed AKI had a higher incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events during follow-up, regardless of CKD (p < 0.025 for both groups).
CONCLUSION: In diabetic patients with CKD undergoing TAVI, SGLT2i therapy was associated with a lower occurrence of AKI compared to those not treated with SGLT2i, suggesting a potential nephroprotective effect in this high-risk population.","['Pasquale Paolisso', 'Marta Belmonte', 'Emanuele Gallinoro', 'Roberto Scarsini', 'Luca Bergamaschi', 'Leonardo Portolan', 'Matteo Armillotta', 'Giuseppe Esposito', 'Elisabetta Moscarella', 'Claudio Montalto', 'Elayne Kelen de Oliveira', 'Francesco Angeli', 'Mateusz Orzalkiewicz', 'Margherita Fabroni', 'Verdiana Galli', 'Nurcan Baydaroglu', 'Francesca Di Lenarda', 'Pasquale Policastro', 'Carlo Terrone', 'Davide Ausiello', 'Giose Vincelli', 'Matteo Casenghi', 'Lucia Scisciola', 'Raffaele Marfella', 'Felice Gragnano', 'Edoardo Conte', 'Dario Pellegrini', 'Alfonso Ielasi', 'Daniele Andreini', 'Jacopo Andrea Oreglia', 'Paolo Calabrò', 'Antonio L Bartorelli', 'Tullio Palmerini', 'Francesco Saia', 'Flavio Ribichini', 'Michelangela Barbieri', 'Marc Vanderheyden', 'Carmine Pizzi', 'Emanuele Barbato']",Cardiovascular diabetology,2025-05-21,10.1186/s12933-025-02773-x,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12933-025-02773-x,PMC12096646,Free,Impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on acute kidney injury in diabetic patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation TAVI PAOLISSO 2025,pdfs\Impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on acute kidney injury in diabetic patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve imp.pdf,"['CKD undergoing TAVI', 'AKI', 'CKD', 'undergoing TAVI', 'TAVI', 'patients', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'aortic valve implantation', 'acute kidney injury', 'aortic valve']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['Acute kidney injury', 'Aortic stenosis', 'Chronic kidney disease', 'SGLT2i', 'Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI)']"

40395684,Perioperative management of transcatheter aortic valve implantation in acquired von Willebrand syndrome secondary to monoclonal gammopathy: a case report.,"BACKGROUND: Acquired von Willebrand syndrome (AvWS) is a rare bleeding disorder associated with conditions like monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). It results from monoclonal antibodies binding to von Willebrand factor (vWF), leading to rapid clearance of vWF and factor VIII (FVIII). Of note, any condition increasing shear stress, such as aortic stenosis (AS), can exacerbate AvWS.
CASE SUMMARY: We report the case of an 81-year-old man with AvWS secondary to MGUS who underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) for severe aortic stenosis. Pre-operative intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) were administered, which normalized FVIII and vWF levels. TAVI was performed without specific haemostatic measures other than vascular closure devices. There were no bleeding complications, and the patient was discharged without antiplatelet therapy. At one-year follow-up, he had no thrombotic or haemorrhagic events.
DISCUSSION: We report the management of a patient affected by AvWS secondary to MGUS who underwent TAVI for severe AS. IVIG were administered preoperatively to temporarily normalize coagulation, as their mechanism of action directly inhibits the increased consumption of vWF. Due to the increased bleeding risk associated with AvWS, antiplatelet therapy was not initiated upon discharge.","['Gaia Filiberti', 'Alessandro Giaj Levra', 'Mauro Chiarito', 'Bernhard Reimers', 'Gianluigi Condorelli']",European heart journal.

40393868,Anxiety during transcatheter aortic valve replacement under local anesthesia - the ART-VR trial.,"BACKGROUND: The use of local anesthesia during transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) could result in patient discomfort. Application of immersive virtual reality (VR) during TAVR might distract the patient and enhance the overall experience.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of an immersive VR environment on periprocedural anxiety and patient discomfort, compared to standard of care in patients undergoing transfemoral (TF) TAVR under local anesthesia.
METHODS: In this single-center, randomized controlled pilot study, patients were randomized to either VR immersion during TAVR or standard of care. The intervention was a VR headset to create 3D experiences during percutaneous transfemoral TAVR. The main outcome was patient-reported procedural anxiety assessed directly after the procedure on a visual analog scale (VAS). Secondary outcomes were procedural satisfaction, pain, and change in anxiety. Personality scores were obtained at baseline to explore associations between personality types and relevant outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 75 patients (VR = 37, control = 38) were included between September 2021 and January 2023. The median age was 79 (25th-75th: 75-84) years and 32 patients (43 %) were female. Overall procedural anxiety VAS was 1.0 (0.0-3.0) and satisfaction was 9.0 (8.0-10.0). There was no difference in procedural anxiety between VR and control (VAS: 1.0 [25th-75th: 0.0-3.0] versus 1.0 [25th-75th: 0.0-3.0], p = 0.59). Procedural satisfaction, pain perception and change in anxiety were not affected by VR use.
CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing TF-TAVR under local anesthesia experienced mild procedural anxiety and high satisfaction levels. Procedural VR use did not affect procedural anxiety or pain perception.","['Sraman Chatterjee', 'Joris Ooms', 'Marjo de Ronde', 'Stefan van Gorsel', 'Antonio Maarten Mattace-Raso', 'Jeannette Goudzwaard', 'Francesco Mattace-Raso', 'Isabella Kardys', 'Rutger-Jan Nuis', 'Joost Daemen', 'Nicolas Van Mieghem']",Cardiovascular revascularization medicine : including molecular interventions,2025-05-15,10.1016/j.carrev.2025.05.015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.carrev.2025.05.015,,Paid,Anxiety during transcatheter aortic valve replacement under local anesthesia the ART VR trial CHATTERJEE 2025,Not available,"['transcatheter aortic valve', 'aortic valve replacement', 'local anesthesia', 'transcatheter aortic', 'aortic valve', 'TAVR', 'valve replacement', 'Anxiety', 'ART-VR trial', 'procedural']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['Anesthesia', 'Anxiety', 'Pain', 'TAVR', 'VR']"
40393632,REdo transcatheter aortic VALVE implantation for the management of transcatheter aortic valve failure: Design and rationale of the REVALVE study.,"BACKGROUND: The expansion of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) into younger and lower risk patients increases the likelihood of future reintervention on the valve due to bioprosthetic valve failure (BVF). However, little is known about the feasibility and outcomes of redo TAVI for BVF.
METHODS: REVALVE is an investigator-initiated, open-label, prospective registry, enrolling 300 patients undergoing redo TAVI in approximately 75 centres in 11 countries in Europe and the Middle East. The primary endpoint is REVALVE success at 30-days, adapted from the Valve Academic Research Consortium-3 (VARC-3) criteria and defined as the correct positioning of a single prosthetic heart valve into the proper anatomic location, intended performance of the valve (mean gradient <20 mmHg, peak velocity < 3.0 m/s, doppler velocity index ≥0.25, <moderate aortic regurgitation), and freedom from mortality, coronary obstruction, unplanned coronary revascularisation, and surgery or intervention related to the device. The co-primary endpoint is a composite of freedom from mortality, stroke, and re-hospitalisation for valve or procedure-related causes at 1 year. Clinical and echocardiographic follow-up will continue to 5 years. Parallel cohorts will include patients presenting with TAV BVF who are managed by surgical explantation and aortic valve replacement (AVR), or by optimal medical therapy. Sub-studies will investigate computer-simulated modelling prior to redo TAVI, post-implant coronary catheterisation, and post-procedure multi-slice computed tomography.
CONCLUSIONS: The REVALVE study is a prospective multi-centre study investigating the management of TAV failure by redo TAVI, with parallel cohorts treated by surgical AVR and optimal medical therapy.

40392447,The relationship between chronic expansion of self-expandable valves and paravalvular leakage in transcatheter aortic valve implantation.,"Paravalvular leakage (PVL) is a clinical concern in transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Although PVL has been reported to gradually decrease after self-expandable valves (SEVs) implantation, the mechanism remains unclear. Furthermore, while gradual expansion of SEVs has been documented, studies assessing their morphological changes during the chronic phase are lacking. This study aims to evaluate whether SEVs expansion occurs during follow-up and if this expansion correlates with a reduction in PVL. We included 60 patients who underwent TAVI using SEVs (Evolut PRO/PRO+/FX) from October 2020 to August 2024. Morphological findings of SEVs were assessed using computed tomography (CT), and PVL was evaluated at discharge and chronic phase post-TAVI. PVL was graded on a five-point scale via transthoracic echocardiography, and the area ratio, defined as the ratio of the basal area of the implanted SEVs to that of phantom valves measured by CT, served as the index of SEVs expansion. Chronic expansion of SEVs was observed in all cases, with the area ratio increasing from 0.59 at discharge to 0.64 at the follow-up (P < 0.05). Among the 60 patients, 44 exhibited mild or greater PVL, with 17 showing improvement at the chronic phase. The degree of valve expansion (area ratio at chronic phase/area ratio at discharge) was significantly greater in the PVL improvement group compared to the non-improvement group (1.11 vs. 1.06, P < 0.05). This study demonstrates that SEVs expand during the chronic phase after TAVI, which could contribute to the reduction of PVL.","['Yuuki Muto', 'Daisuke Isomatsu', 'Yu Sato', 'Akihiko Sato', 'Takeshi Shimizu', 'Tomofumi Misaka', 'Masayoshi Oikawa', 'Atsushi Kobayashi', 'Akiomi Yoshihisa', 'Kazuhiko Nakazato', 'Takafumi Ishida', 'Hirofumi Sekino', 'Kenji Fukushima', 'Hiroshi Ito', 'Yasuchika Takeishi']",Cardiovascular intervention and therapeutics,2025-05-20,10.1007/s12928-025-01140-7,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12928-025-01140-7,PMC8837046,Free,The relationship between chronic expansion of self expandable valves and paravalvular leakage in transcatheter aortic valve implantation MUTO 2025,pdfs\The relationship between chronic expansion of self expandable valves and paravalvular leakage in transcatheter aortic valve implantation MUT.pdf,"['transcatheter aortic valve', 'PVL', 'transcatheter heart valves', 'aortic valve', 'Evolut PRO', 'transcatheter aortic', 'aortic valve implantation', 'valve', 'valves', 'Generation Transcatheter Aortic']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['Aortic stenosis', 'Computed tomography (CT)', 'Paravalvular leakage (PVL)', 'Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI)', 'Valve expansion']"
40391859,Impact of Periprocedural Statin Therapy on Mortality and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: A Meta-Analysis and Meta-Regression.,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) stands as a notable alternative to surgical valve replacement for severe aortic stenosis (AS). Despite the established benefits of statins in cardiovascular pathologies, their specific impact in patients with severe AS undergoing TAVR remains uncertain.
AIMS: Our meta-analysis aims to assess whether periprocedural statin therapy improves survival and outcomes post-TAVR, thus addressing this gap in literature.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search using various databases with relevant keywords terms was conducted to identify studies on the impact of periprocedural statin therapy on TAVR outcomes. We assessed the primary outcome of all-cause mortality alongside various secondary outcomes including stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA), myocardial infarction, acute kidney injury (AKI), 30-day mortality, in-hospital mortality, rehospitalization, cardiovascular complications, and pacemaker requirement. A random-effects model using Comprehensive Meta Analysis Software was employed to analyze the data for each outcome. Statistical significance was set at a p < 0.05.
RESULTS: Our analysis of 19 observational studies revealed that periprocedural statin therapy significantly reduces all-cause mortality following TAVR surgery (OR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.61-0.83, p < 0.001). However, the influence of statins on other outcomes remains inconclusive. These outcomes include stroke/TIA (OR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.68-1.19, p = 0.455), risk of MI (OR = 1.72, 95% CI: 0.73-4.04, p = 0.214), AKI (OR = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.75-1.31, p = 0.968), 30-day mortality (OR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.46-1.10, p = 0.126), in-hospital mortality (OR = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.13-1.38, p = 0.151), rehospitalization (OR = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.66-1.29, p = 0.645), cardiovascular complications (OR = 1.12, 95% CI: 0.91-1.37, p = 0.297), and pacemaker requirement (OR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.65-1.06, p = 0.133).
CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis indicates a potentially promising role for periprocedural statin therapy in enhancing patient outcomes post-TAVR surgery. We found a notable association between statin therapy and a reduction in all-cause mortality. However, the effects on secondary outcomes did not reach statistical significance, which warrants further investigation through larger, well-designed, randomized controlled trials.","['Aman Goyal', 'Surabhi Maheshwari', 'Yusra Mashkoor', 'Ajeet Singh', 'Faryal Rafique', 'Abu Baker Sheikh', 'Kamna Bansal']",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,2025-05-20,10.1002/ccd.31607,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.31607,,Paid,Impact of Periprocedural Statin Therapy on Mortality and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement A Meta Analysis and Meta Regression GOYAL 2025,Not available,"['Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Valve Replacement', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'Periprocedural Statin Therapy', 'Aortic Valve', 'surgical valve replacement', 'Statin Therapy', 'Periprocedural Statin', 'Statin']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['TAVI', 'TAVR', 'cardiology', 'complications', 'meta‐analysis', 'mortality', 'statins', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"
40388768,Heyde syndrome: Experiences with the use of semiautomatic vWF multimer analysis for diagnosis and TAVI for treatment - case report.,"RATIONALE: Aortic stenosis (AS) is currently the most frequent valve disorder. In addition, the angiodysplasias are the most common vascular malformations of the gastrointestinal tract. Heyde syndrome (HS) is a rare disease which links these 2 pathological conditions.
PATIENT CONCERNS: Currently, there are no clearly defined guidelines for the confirmation of HS diagnosis and for timing of aortic valve replacement in patients with confirmed HS, despite the fact that HS is connected with increased mortality and the need for numerous rehospitalizations and multiple blood transfusions. Therefore, the aim of this study was to report (our) first experiences with novel diagnostic method for acquired von Willebrand (vW) syndrome and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for treatment of HS.
DIAGNOSES: We report a case of a 68-year-old man who was diagnosed with HS with the use of semiautomatic vW factor multimer analysis.
INTERVENTIONS: A successful TAVR was used for treatment of AS.
OUTCOMES: After the interventional treatment of AS, the patient did not have a recurrence of the anemic syndrome.
LESSONS: This is a unique case of a patient with HS in whom semiautomatic vW factor multimer analysis was used for diagnosis of acquired vW syndrome together with TAVR procedure for HS treatment.","['Boris Focko', 'Zuzana Miertová', 'Ingrid Škorňová', 'Martin Hudec', 'Martin Jozef Péč', 'Jakub Jurica', 'Marek Cingel', 'Tomáš Bolek', 'Juraj Sokol', 'Petra Poliačiková', 'Marián Mokáň', 'Matej Samoš']",Medicine,2025-05-16,10.1097/MD.0000000000042486,https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000042486,PMC12091634,Free,Heyde syndrome Experiences with the use of semiautomatic vWF multimer analysis for diagnosis and TAVI for treatment case report FOCKO 2025,pdfs\Heyde syndrome Experiences with the use of semiautomatic vWF multimer analysis for diagnosis and TAVI for treatment case report FOCKO 2025.p.pdf,"['acquired von Willebrand', 'aortic valve', 'aortic valve replacement', 'von Willebrand syndrome', 'von Willebrand', 'multimer analysis', 'vWF multimer analysis', 'University Hospital Martin', 'factor multimer analysis', 'transcatheter aortic valve']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['Heyde syndrome', 'acquired von Willebrand syndrome', 'aortic stenosis', 'semiautomatic von Willebrand factor multimer analysis']"
40384343,Continuation Versus Interruption of Oral Anticoagulation During TAVI: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Oral Anticoagulation Management in TAVI.,"Patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) often require long-term oral anticoagulation (OAC), but it is unclear whether to continue or interrupt OAC during the procedure. This meta-analysis compares clinical outcomes of continuing versus interrupting OAC during TAVI. PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central databases were searched from inception to September 2024 for studies comparing continuation versus interruption of OAC in patients undergoing TAVI with an indication for OAC, including vitamin K antagonists and direct oral anticoagulants. Risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were pooled using a random-effects model. Sensitivity analysis was performed using the Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman method. Three studies were included, one randomized controlled trial and two cohort studies, with 2773 patients, of whom 1314 (47.4%) continued OAC during TAVI. At a 30-day follow-up after TAVI, there were no significant differences between groups in all-cause mortality (RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.45-1.20; p = 0.22), any bleeding (RR 1.08; 95% CI 0.81-1.43; p = 0.60), and major bleeding (RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.67-1.21; p = 0.48). However, the continued OAC group was associated with a lower stroke rate (RR 0.65; 95% CI 0.42-1.01; p = 0.053), also attested after a sensitivity analysis (RR 0.65; 95% CI 0.47-0.90; p < 0.03). In patients with an indication for OAC undergoing TAVI, uninterrupted anticoagulation is associated with similar thrombotic and hemorrhagic outcomes compared to interrupted OAC. Stroke risk was lower in the continued OAC group, with a significant reduction, as demonstrated in sensitivity analysis.","['Jefferson Manoel Borges Martins', 'Rafael Dos Santos Borges', 'Giovanni Gosch Berton', 'Paula Larissa Ferreira Vieira', 'Pedro Antônio Machado Gomes de Sousa', 'Ana Livia Chaves Vieira', 'Christian Ken Fukunaga', 'Vanessa Karlinski Vizentin', 'Esthefani Monique Rodrigues Macedo', 'Camila Mota Guida']",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,2025-05-19,10.1002/ccd.31599,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.31599,,Paid,Continuation Versus Interruption of Oral Anticoagulation During TAVI A Systematic Review and Meta Analysis Oral Anticoagulation Management in TAVI MARTINS 2025,Not available,"['Oral Anticoagulation Management', 'Systematic Review', 'Oral Anticoagulation', 'Anticoagulation Management', 'Meta-Analysis Oral Anticoagulation', 'Continuation Versus Interruption', 'OAC', 'TAVI', 'long-term oral anticoagulation', 'OAC undergoing TAVI']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['direct oral anticoagulants', 'perioperative care', 'stroke', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement', 'treatment interruption', 'vitamin K antagonists']"
40383183,The safety and feasibility of same day discharge for patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Next day discharge (NDD) after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has been shown to be safe in appropriately selected patients and has since been implemented into clinical practice. As the demand for TAVR grows, improving its accessibility is crucial. Several studies have trialled same day discharge (SDD) after TAVR, but a review has not been performed.
METHODS: Five databases were searched. Baseline demographics, study characteristics and the assessment criteria used to determine eligibility for SDD were extracted and compared. Proportional meta-analysis was used to compare post-TAVI outcomes between SDD and NDD patients.
RESULTS: Six studies were included from 1734 screened articles. Of 3519 patients, 318 (9.0%) underwent SDD (mean age 78.2 ± 8.7 years; 59.3% male). Balloon-expanding valves were used in 91.6% of cases, and self-expanding valves in the remaining 8.4%. Patients that underwent SDD experienced lower rates of mortality (OR 0.104, 95% CI: 0.015 - 0.998), all-cause readmission (OR 0.194, 95% CI 0.052 - 0.717), cardiovascular readmissions (OR 0.155, 95% CI 0.026 - 0.971), and new pacemaker requirement (OR 0.167, 95% 0.028 - 0.995) at 30 days after TAVR, compared to patients that underwent NDD. There was no difference in rates of stroke (OR 0.407, 95% CI: 0.015 - 16.694) or major vascular complications (0.0% vs 0.0%).
CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence supports the safety and feasibility of SDD after elective, transfemoral TAVR in appropriately selected patients. Heterogeneity between eligibility criteria used to select patients for SDD, especially related to conduction disease, poses a barrier to implementation. Further research on self-expanding valves is needed.","['Princess Neila Litkouhi', 'Karan Rao', 'Alexandra Baer', 'Peter S Hansen', 'Ravinay Bhindi']",The Canadian journal of cardiology,2025-05-16,10.1016/j.cjca.2025.05.007,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2025.05.007,,Paid,The safety and feasibility of same day discharge for patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement a systematic review and meta analysis LITKOUHI 2025,Not available,"['aortic valve replacement', 'undergoing transcatheter aortic', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'transcatheter aortic', 'day discharge', 'SDD', 'TAVR', 'patients undergoing transcatheter', 'valve replacement', 'patients']",2025-05-27,Pending,[]
40375767,Leaflet modification techniques to mitigate coronary obstruction risk during transcatheter aortic valve implantation.,"Coronary obstruction is a rare but serious complication during transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), particularly in valve-in-valve procedures, which is associated with high mortality. This review explores various leaflet modification techniques designed to mitigate this risk. Among the most studied methods is Bioprosthetic or native Aortic Scallop Intentional Laceration to prevent Iatrogenic Coronary Artery obstruction (BASILICA), which uses transcatheter electrosurgery to lacerate the aortic valve leaflet and maintain coronary perfusion. Other promising techniques include ShortCut, a mechanical leaflet splitting device, and Undermining Iatrogenic Coronary Obstruction with Radiofrequency Needle (UNICORN), which utilises radiofrequency energy to achieve leaflet laceration. These approaches differ in their procedural complexity, equipment requirements, and clinical outcomes. Each technique's efficacy in preventing coronary obstruction is discussed, alongside the potential complications and the procedural challenges encountered in both native aortic valve and valve-in-valve settings. This review also highlights the importance of careful patient selection, advanced imaging techniques, and the need for further research to optimise these strategies.","['Sunny Goel', 'Richard Tanner', 'Kwong-Yue Eric Chan', 'Jaffar M Khan', 'Manish Vinayak', 'Stamatios Lerakis', 'Lucy M Safi', 'Sahil Khera', 'Parasuram Krishnamoorthy', 'Annapoorna S Kini', 'Samin K Sharma', 'George D Dangas', 'Gilbert H L Tang']",EuroIntervention : journal of EuroPCR in collaboration with the Working Group on Interventional Cardiology of the European Society of Cardiology,2025-05-16,10.4244/EIJ-D-24-00972,https://doi.org/10.4244/EIJ-D-24-00972,PMC12063549,Paid,Leaflet modification techniques to mitigate coronary obstruction risk during transcatheter aortic valve implantation GOEL 2025,Not downloaded,"['aortic valve implantation', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'aortic valve', 'coronary obstruction', 'valve implantation', 'Aortic Scallop Intentional', 'coronary', 'aortic', 'Iatrogenic Coronary Artery', 'transcatheter aortic']",2025-05-27,Pending,[]
40375761,Long-term structural valve deterioration after TAVI: insights from the EORP ESC Valve Durability TAVI Registry.,"BACKGROUND: Valve durability is a key consideration as the patient population eligible for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) expands to include lower-risk and younger individuals who are expected to live many years after the procedure.
AIMS: This registry aimed to assess the incidence of long-term structural valve deterioration (SVD) beyond 5 years post-TAVI.
METHODS: Consecutive living patients who underwent TAVI up until 2014 using any commercially available transcatheter heart valve (THV) at 22 participant centres were enrolled in the European Valve Durability TAVI Registry. All patients underwent comprehensive echocardiographic assessments (61% were evaluated independently by a central core laboratory) within 6 months of enrolment and at least 5 years post-TAVI; SVD was defined according to Valve Academic Research Consortium 3 definitions.
RESULTS: A total of 597 patients (aged 79.6±7.1 years at the time of TAVI; 47.2% male, mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons score 5.0%) were included. At a median of 6.1 years of follow-up (interquartile range 5.2-7.3 years), the crude incidence of moderate/severe SVD was 9.5% (n=57; moderate: 6.2%, n=37; severe: 3.4%, n=20). Predictors of SVD identified by Cox regression analysis were use of an intra-annular THV (hazard ratio [HR] 38.44, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 10.8-136.3; p<0.001), a small THV size (HR 4.82, 95% CI: 2.42-9.60; p<0.001) and moderate/severe postprocedural paravalvular leak (HR 3.64, 95% CI: 1.59-8.32; p=0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of moderate/severe SVD during long-term follow-up after TAVI is low, with severe SVD being even rarer than moderate SVD. SVD occurs more frequently in patients treated with older-generation intra-annular valves and in those with small-sized THVs.","['Cristina Giannini', 'Davide Capodanno', 'Gabor G Toth', 'Stephan Windecker', 'Stefanie Schüpke', 'Daniel J Blackman', 'Stéphane Noble', 'Hélène Eltchaninoff', 'Claudia Fiorina', 'Alaide Chieffo', 'Antonio L Bartorelli', 'Albrecht Schmidt', 'Ole De Backer', 'Martine Gilard', 'Elizabeth Curtis', ""Guillaume L'Official"", 'Erwan Donal', 'Cécile Laroche', 'Bernard Prendergast', 'Anna Sonia Petronio', 'On Behalf The European Valve Durability Tavi Registry Investigators']",EuroIntervention : journal of EuroPCR in collaboration with the Working Group on Interventional Cardiology of the European Society of Cardiology,2025-05-16,10.4244/EIJ-D-24-00662,https://doi.org/10.4244/EIJ-D-24-00662,PMC12063547,Paid,Long term structural valve deterioration after TAVI insights from the EORP ESC Valve Durability TAVI Registry GIANNINI 2025,Not downloaded,"['EORP ESC Valve', 'ESC Valve Durability', 'EORP ESC', 'Durability TAVI Registry', 'Valve Durability TAVI', 'Valve Durability', 'Durability TAVI', 'European Valve Durability', 'ESC Valve', 'structural valve deterioration']",2025-05-27,Pending,[]
40372482,Mid- to long-term outcomes of covered balloon-expandable stent implantation for the management of vascular injuries in patients undergoing transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation: the BE-SAFE Registry : for the RECOVER (REsults after percutaneous interventions with COVERed stents) Investigators.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Vascular complications occur in a non-negligible proportion of transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation (Tf-TAVI) procedures. There is only limited evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of covered balloon-expandable (CBE) stents in the management of Tf-TAVI related vascular complications. We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of CBE stent implantation to treat access-related vascular complications in patients undergoing Tf-TAVI.
METHODS: The present retrospective analysis included patients undergoing CBE stent implantation following Tf-TAVI from April 2012 to January 2023 at our centre. The primary endpoint was technical success defined as successful device delivery and implantation at the intended location with angiographic confirmation of vessel patency and absence of residual bleeding. Clinical outcomes and color Doppler ultrasonography findings were evaluated at discharge, 30 days and longest available follow-up.
RESULTS: Among 3331 Tf-TAVI procedures, 93 patients (2.8%) required covered stent implantation for the treatment of access related vascular complications. Technical success was achieved in 92 patients (98.9%). BeGraft and Atrium Advanta V12 CBE stents were implanted in 76 (81.7%) and 17 (18.3%) patients, respectively. Median clinical follow-up was 455 [304; 798] days, with both in-hospital and 30-days mortality equaling 4.3% and 1-year mortality 15.1%. Pre-discharge Doppler ultrasonography was performed in 98.9% patients, with normal findings in 79.8% and minor findings (such as pseudoaneurysm, non-flow-limiting dissection, arterio-venous fistula) in the remaining patients. Clinical follow-up was available in 96.2% patients; no cases of new-onset claudication, need for repeat surgical or transcatheter vascular interventions were recorded. Follow-up Doppler ultrasonography (54.4% patients) showed persistent patency and no signs of stent failure in all patients.
CONCLUSIONS: CBE stent implantation for the treatment of access site related vascular complications after Tf-TAVI is associated with excellent technical success rates, optimal short- to mid-term patency rates as well as satisfactory long-term clinical outcomes.","['Hector A Alvarez-Covarrubias', 'Martin Jurisic', 'Finn Syryca', 'Charlotte Duesmann', 'Costanza Pellegrini', 'Tobias Rheude', 'N Patrick Mayr', 'Niklas Altaner', 'Moritz Kühlein', 'Tobias Lenz', 'Edna Blum', 'Yousuke Taniguchi', 'Gjin Ndrepepa', 'Christian Thilo', 'Heribert Schunkert', 'Adnan Kastrati', 'Sebastian Kufner', 'Salvatore Cassese', 'Michael Joner', 'Erion Xhepa']",Clinical research in cardiology : official journal of the German Cardiac Society,2025-05-15,10.1007/s00392-025-02651-2,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00392-025-02651-2,PMC7578005,Paid,Mid to long term outcomes of covered balloon expandable stent implantation for the management of vascular injuries in patients undergoing transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation the BE SAFE Registry for the RECOVER REsults after percutaneous interventions with COVERed stents Investigators ALVAREZ-COVARRUBIAS 2025,Not downloaded,"['CBE stent implantation', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'BE-SAFE Registry', 'transfemoral transcatheter aortic', 'aortic valve implantation', 'Vascular complications', 'CBE stent', 'stent implantation', 'related vascular complications', 'patients']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['Covered balloon-expandable stent', 'Transcatheter aortic valve implantation', 'Transfemoral access', 'Vascular complication']"
40371611,Comparing Major Gastrointestinal Bleeding in Patients Receiving Edoxaban Versus Warfarin After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: Results From the Randomized ENVISAGE-TAVI AF Trial.,"BACKGROUND: Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants are recommended over vitamin K antagonists in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF). However, the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding may be higher with non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants versus vitamin K antagonists. Patients after successful transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) who are elderly and frail have worse outcomes with major gastrointestinal bleeding (MGIB), including death. This study evaluated incidence, predictors, and impact of MGIB among patients with AF after successful TAVR.
METHODS: This on-treatment analysis of ENVISAGE-TAVI AF (Edoxaban Compared to Standard Care After Heart Valve Replacement Using a Catheter in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation) included patients who received ≥1 dose of the study drug. Demographic, clinical, and procedural characteristics were compared between patients with versus without an MGIB event. Cox multivariable regression analysis identified predictors of MGIB.
RESULTS: Of 1377 patients in this analysis, 83 (6.0%) experienced MGIB, with 56 (67.5%) of these patients receiving edoxaban. Patients with versus without MGIB were more likely to have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention ≤30 days before TAVR (9.6% versus 4.2%; P=0.03), a higher ejection fraction (mean±SD, 58.0±10.4 versus 55.3±11.5; P=0.04), and carotid artery disease (13.3% versus 6.6%; P=0.04). Edoxaban without dose adjustment versus vitamin K antagonist use (P=0.003), smoking (P=0.01), low hemoglobin levels (P<0.0001), and percutaneous coronary intervention ≤30 days before TAVR (P=0.01) emerged as predictors of MGIB.
CONCLUSIONS: In this ENVISAGE-TAVI AF subanalysis, MGIB occurred in 6.0% of patients with prevalent or incident AF undergoing TAVR, and those receiving edoxaban versus vitamin K antagonists had a higher risk of MGIB. A priori identification of risk factors for MGIB may help optimize outcomes for patients with AF undergoing TAVR.

40371597,Anatomical and Functional Predictors of Permanent Pacemaker Implantation After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.,"BACKGROUND: High-degree atrioventricular block with the need for permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation represents a frequent complication after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Extension of indication for TAVI toward subjects with lower surgical risk requires reduction of the likelihood for the need for PPM implantation. The aim of the current analysis was to identify predictors of the need for PPM implantation after TAVI.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In a cohort of 1500 consecutive patients without a PPM undergoing transfemoral TAVI, clinical and procedural characteristics as well as parameters derived from cardiac computed tomography, such as membranous septal length and calcium volumes of the aortic valve cusps and the left ventricular outflow tract were assessed. Median calcium volume of the aortic valve was 552 mm3 (interquartile range [IQR]: 340-811 mm3) in the group of subjects requiring a PPM, which was higher than in the group of subjects not requiring PPM implantation (455 mm3 [IQR: 245-723 mm3], Padj=0.001). The same was true for calcification of the noncoronary cusp (Padj=0.027), left coronary cusp (Padj=0.033), and right coronary cusp (Padj=0.006). In multivariable analysis, calcium volume of the noncoronary cusp (P=0.039; odds ratio [OR], 1.089 per 100 mm3), preexisting complete right bundle-branch block (P<0.001; OR, 9.402), and implantation of a self-expandable prosthesis (P<0.001; OR, 1.856) were significantly associated with PPM implantation after TAVI.
CONCLUSIONS: The current analysis offers a detailed examination of predictors for the need for PPM implantation after TAVI.

40371590,A Two-Step Risk Score for Prediction of Permanent Pacemaker Implantation After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.,"BACKGROUND: The need for postoperative permanent pacemaker implantation (PPMI) remains one of the most frequent complications after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). This study aimed to develop a novel, 2-step risk score to predict PPMI probability after TAVI and implement it into a user-friendly website. Our risk score addresses the data gap on current prosthesis generations and provides a new, clinically motivated approach to calculating PPMI risk.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Between January 2019 and December 2020, 1039 patients underwent TAVI at our institution. We retrospectively evaluated clinical, electrocardiographic, echocardiographic, computed tomographic, and periprocedural data. Patients with prior PPMI were excluded. We developed a prediction model for PPMI occurrence, using 55 patient and procedural characteristics. With exclusion criteria applied, 836 patients (mean age 80.3±9.1 years; 50.6% female) were included. Of these, 149 (17.8%) required PPMI within 30 days after TAVI. Fourteen preprocedural parameters, including preexisting right bundle-branch block, atrioventricular block, left bundle-branch block, bradycardia, interventricular septum thickness, New York Heart Association class, and aortic annulus perimeter, were identified as PPMI risk factors and used to calculate the baseline risk in the first step of the TAVI PACER score. The second step includes intraprocedural variables to demonstrate how PPMI risk can vary based on valve type and implantation depth. The TAVI PACER score predicts PPMI with a sensitivity of 76% and specificity of 72% (area under the curve=0.8).
CONCLUSIONS: The TAVI PACER score provides a novel tool for daily clinical practice, predicting individual PPMI risk after TAVI based on various patient and procedural characteristics.","['Alexandra Janiszewski', 'Julia Lueg', 'Daniel Schulze', 'Benjamin Juri', 'Louis Morell', 'Maria Hajduczenia', 'Pierre Hennig', 'Aslihan Erbay', 'Alexander Lembcke', 'Stefan Niehues', 'Ulf Landmesser', 'Karl Stangl', 'David Leistner', 'Verena Tscholl', 'Henryk Dreger']",Journal of the American Heart Association,2025-05-20,10.1161/JAHA.124.039036,https://doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.124.039036,,Paid,A Two Step Risk Score for Prediction of Permanent Pacemaker Implantation After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation JANISZEWSKI 2025,Not available,"['Permanent Pacemaker Implantation', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Aortic Valve Implantation', 'Permanent Pacemaker', 'TAVI PACER score', 'Pacemaker Implantation', 'postoperative permanent pacemaker', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'Valve Implantation', 'PPMI']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['TAVI', 'aortic valve', 'pacemaker', 'risk score']"

40035527,Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation in Brazilian Public Health System: A Single-Center Experience.,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has been established as the treatment of choice for severe aortic stenosis in high-risk patients as well as patients above 75 years old in all risk spectrums. Despite its worldwide adoption, implementation in lower-middle-income countries such as the Brazilian public health system (SUS, acronym in Portuguese) is incipient.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate TAVI exclusively within SUS patients.
METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study in a public tertiary hospital in southern Brazil. All patients who underwent TAVI between 2018 and 2024 were included. The cohort was divided into 2 temporal periods: from July 2018 to December 2022 (n = 60) and January 2023 to October 2024 (n = 65). The clinical and procedural characteristics and in-hospital, as well as 1 year of outcomes, were evaluated according to Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 (VARC-2) criteria.
RESULTS: During the study period, 125 patients underwent TAVI. The average age was 80 years (± 10), and 49.6% were male. The mean aortic valve area was 0.76 cm² and the mean gradient was 45 (±13) mm Hg. The mean STS predicted risk of mortality (STS-PROM) score was 4.6% (±3.6). Device success was achieved in 119 patients (95.2%). In-hospital mortality was 2 (1.6%). A new permanent pacemaker was required in 16 (12.8%). Demographic and clinical characteristics between the first and the second periods were similar.

40394915,Short-term outcomes of transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement with Venus-P valve in patients with moderate-to-severe pulmonary regurgitation and right ventricular systolic dysfunction.,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the short-term outcomes of transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement (TPVR) using the Venus-P valve in patients with moderate-to-severe pulmonary regurgitation and right ventricular systolic dysfunction (RVSD) following surgical repair of complex congenital heart disease.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on patients undergoing Venus-P valve implantation (TPVR group, n=28) or surgical pulmonary valve replacement (SPVR group, n=19) at Fuwai Hospital between February 2014 and February 2024. All patients had moderate-to-severe pulmonary regurgitation with right ventricular ejection fraction less than 45% preoperatively. Postoperative pulmonary valve function and ventricular parameters were assessed at discharge and during 6-month follow-up.
RESULTS: All procedures were successfully completed with no early mortality. At 6 months, the TPVR group demonstrated significantly lower pulmonary valve transvalvular pressure gradients compared to the SPVR group (P<0.05). Both groups exhibited significant improvements from baseline in NYHA functional class, biventricular ejection fractions, and right ventricular end-diastolic volume index (all P<0.05). The reduction in right ventricular end-diastolic diameter differed between the two groups (P<0.01); however, multivariable analysis revealed no association between this difference and surgical approach (β=4.4, P>0.05). In the TPVR group, QRS duration shortened significantly postoperatively (P<0.01), with improvements in left ventricular end-diastolic volume index and cardiac index (both P<0.01), but these improvements did not differ significantly from the SPVR group (all P>0.05). During the follow-up, one patient in each group developed infective endocarditis within 1-month post-procedure; both were successfully treated with antibiotics. No other major complications were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: For patients with moderate-to-severe pulmonary regurgitation and RVSD, TPVR using the Venus-P valve effectively improves short-term pulmonary valve function and ventricular performance with a favorable safety profile, which shows potential as a minimally invasive alternative to SPVR .
目的: 评估Venus-P瓣膜经导管肺动脉瓣置换术（TPVR）治疗复杂先天性心脏病术后中重度肺动脉瓣反流合并右心室收缩功能不全患者的近期疗效。方法: 回顾性纳入2014年2月至2024年2月于阜外医院接受Venus-P瓣膜TPVR治疗（28例）或外科肺动脉瓣置换术（SPVR）治疗（19例）的患者。所有患者术前均存在中重度肺动脉瓣反流且右心室射血分数小于45%。评估患者出院时及随访期间（随访至术后6个月）肺动脉瓣功能与心室功能的变化，并比较两种术式的疗效差异。结果: 所有患者均顺利完成手术，术后无早期死亡。术后6个月，TPVR组肺动脉瓣跨瓣压差显著低于SPVR组（P<0.05）。两组患者的纽约心脏协会心功能分级、双心室射血分数及右心室舒张末期容积指数较术前均显著改善（均P<0.05）。术后右心室舒张末期横径改善幅度在两组间存在显著差异（P<0.01），多变量分析提示该差异与术式无关（β=4.4，P>0.05）。TPVR组术后QRS时限显著缩短（P<0.01），左心室舒张末期容积指数及心脏指数亦有改善（均P<0.01），但改善幅度与SPVR组差异无统计学意义（均P>0.05）。随访期间，两组各有1例患者术后1个月发生感染性心内膜炎，经抗感染治疗痊愈，未见其他严重并发症。结论: 对于中重度肺动脉瓣反流合并右心室收缩功能不全的患者，Venus-P瓣膜TPVR可有效改善短期肺动脉瓣功能及心室功能，且安全性良好，具有成为SPVR微创替代方案的潜力。.","['Haiyue Xie', 'Wenhao Zhu', 'Zhiyuan Xia', 'Gejun Zhang']",Zhejiang da xue xue bao.

40392782,Comparative effects of transcatheter versus surgical pulmonary valve replacement: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: Transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement (TPVR) is developed as a non-surgical, minimally invasive procedure to reduce the need for re-do cardiac surgical interventions. However, its impacts on patient outcomes are less clear. This study aims to investigate the effects of TPVR among patients with pulmonary valve or right ventricular outflow tract dysfunctions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, EMBASE, CINAHL Complete, and Web of Science, from database inception to March 1, 2024, to identify studies that assessed the comparative effectiveness of transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement (TPVR) and surgical pulmonary valve replacement (SPVR). The key outcomes of interest included mortality, pulmonary regurgitation (PR), infective endocarditis (IE), re-intervention, improvements in cardiac failure based on the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification, and adverse events. Meta-analyses using a random-effects model were performed.
RESULTS: A total of 28 studies (n = 16,150) were included. The meta-analyses depicted that when compared with SPVR, TPVR reduced risks of mortality by 36% (odds ratio [OR] = 0.64 [95% confidence interval, CI: 0.43, 0.95]), but conferred a three-fold greater odd of IE over the follow-up duration (OR = 3.10 [95% CI: 2.22, 4.33]). No significant differences were observed for 30-day mortality, and the early PR, IE and re-intervention, as well as the PR and re-intervention during follow-up. Meta-analyzed results across the outcome measures varied according to geographical region, publication year cut-off, and income status of country. All patients who had undergone valve replacement showed improvements in heart function and experienced relevant post-procedural complications.
CONCLUSIONS: TPVR afforded significant clinical benefits in patient survival, but nonetheless, it was associated with an elevated risk for infective endocarditis.","['Bunchai Chongmelaxme', 'Kok Pim Kua', 'Chanokpol Amornvetchayakul', 'Nichapond Chawviriyathep', 'Thunyapat Kerdklinhom']",PloS one,2025-05-27,10.1371/journal.pone.0322041,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0322041,PMC12091831,Free,Comparative effects of transcatheter versus surgical pulmonary valve replacement A systematic review and meta analysis CHONGMELAXME 2025,pdfs\Comparative effects of transcatheter versus surgical pulmonary valve replacement A systematic review and meta analysis CHONGMELAXME 2025.pdf,"['pulmonary valve replacement', 'Transcatheter pulmonary valve', 'surgical pulmonary valve', 'pulmonary valve', 'valve replacement', 'versus surgical pulmonary', 'transcatheter versus surgical', 'pulmonary valve requiring', 'valve', 'transcatheter valve Femoral']",2025-05-27,Pending,[]
40423763,Association between psoas muscle area and outcomes after transcatheter tricuspid valve repair.,"Transcatheter tricuspid valve repair (TTVR) might be an alternative option to reduce tricuspid regurgitation (TR) in patients with sarcopenia. Psoas muscle area (PMA) measured using computed tomography (CT) is known as a marker of sarcopenia. We investigated the association of PMA with procedural and clinical outcomes following TTVR. We retrospectively measured left and right PMA using pre-procedural CT in patients undergoing TTVR. Low PMA was defined as the total PMA < 20.3 cm2 for men and < 11.8 cm2 for women. The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalization within one year after TTVR. Of 163 patients, 47 (29%) were considered as having low PMA. Procedural success, defined as residual TR of ≤ 2 + at discharge, and in-hospital mortality were comparable between patients with low and high PMA. Patients with low PMA had a higher incidence of the composite outcome than those with high PMA (49% vs. 21%; p = 0.001) This association was consistent after adjusting for baseline characteristics (adjusted hazard ratio 0.43; 95% confidence interval: 0.23-0.80; p = 0.008). In contrast, the New York Heart Association functional class improved from baseline to three-month follow-up, regardless of PMA. Approximately 30% of patients undergoing TTVR were found to have low PMA. Although TTVR may be a safe therapeutic option to reduce TR and improve heart failure symptoms in patients with sarcopenia, the prognosis after TTVR remains poor in this population. Pre-procedural CT-based assessment of PMA may enhance risk stratification and support better clinical decision-making for TTVR.","['Mahmoud Balata', 'Tetsu Tanaka', 'Atsushi Sugiura', 'Refik Kavsur', 'Johanna Vogelhuber', 'Can Öztürk', 'Sebastian Zimmer', 'Julian Luetkens', 'Georg Nickenig', 'Marcel Weber']",Cardiovascular intervention and therapeutics,2025-05-27,10.1007/s12928-025-01136-3,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12928-025-01136-3,PMC10167545,Paid,Association between psoas muscle area and outcomes after transcatheter tricuspid valve repair BALATA 2025,Not downloaded,"['tricuspid valve repair', 'transcatheter tricuspid valve', 'PMA', 'TTVR', 'valve repair', 'Low PMA', 'tricuspid valve', 'psoas muscle area', 'transcatheter tricuspid', 'patients']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['Psoas muscle area', 'Sarcopenia', 'Transcatheter tricuspid valve repair', 'Tricuspid regurgitation']"
40419743,Development of transcatheter implantable autologous tissue-engineered pulmonary valves using in-body tissue architecture.,"Transcatheter pulmonary valve implantation (TPVI) is a minimally invasive procedure used to treat pulmonary valve dysfunction in congenital heart disease. However, the limited durability of xenogeneic bioprosthetic valves is a significant concern. Tissue-engineered heart valves (TEHVs) have emerged as a promising alternative. We developed an autologous TEHV, Biovalve, using an in-body tissue architecture technology based on tissue encapsulation. In this study, we aimed to develop stent-integrated Biovalves (stent Biovalves) that can be applied to TPVI. We designed an asymmetric hourglass-shaped stent and a caged mold specifically for TPVI. The stent was fixed inside the mold by placing it on a core rod and covering it with an outer cage. After subcutaneous implantation of the molds with stents for 2 months, the molds with formed tissue were harvested and removed to obtain the stent Biovalve. The stent struts were completely covered with dense collagen. The stent Biovalve demonstrated intact insertion and deployment via the catheter and was successfully implanted in the goat pulmonary valve location. No complications such as stenosis, regurgitation, or translocation occurred post-implantation, with about 6 months of survival without anticoagulant therapy, excellent biocompatibility, and potential antithrombotic properties. There were no significant findings of thrombus or calcification in the excised Biovalve, and cell migration from the host tissue indicated ongoing tissue remodeling. Utilizing a novel mold with an outer cage ensures stent integration, enabling Biovalve production regardless of stent shape. This study presents a promising strategy to address the challenges of transcatheter heart valve implantation.","['Yasushi Sato', 'Yusuke Inoue', 'Takeshi Terazawa', 'Tomoki Nagayoshi', 'Kazuto Fujimoto', 'Isao Shiraishi', 'Kensuke Takamatsu', 'Kunihiro Ohta', 'Yoshiaki Takewa']",Journal of artificial organs : the official journal of the Japanese Society for Artificial Organs,2025-05-26,10.1007/s10047-025-01507-w,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10047-025-01507-w,PMC10143004,Free,Development of transcatheter implantable autologous tissue engineered pulmonary valves using in body tissue architecture SATO 2025,pdfs\Development of transcatheter implantable autologous tissue engineered pulmonary valves using in body tissue architecture SATO 2025.pdf,"['heart valve', 'heart', 'valve', 'Growing Heart Valve', 'Heart Valve Implants', 'valves', 'heart valve replacement', 'congenital heart disease', 'Tissue-engineered heart valves', 'Growing Heart']",2025-05-27,Pending,"['Artificial\xa0heart valve', 'In body tissue architecture', 'Tissue engineered heart valve', 'Transcatheter valve implantation', '\xa0Autologous tissue graft']"
