40353875,Evidence of bioprosthetic valve dysfunction during three-year follow-up following TAVR.,"OBJECTIVE: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has increased significantly in younger patients and patients at lower surgical risk. In this retrospective multicenter study, we aimed to assess for bioprosthetic valve dysfunction (BVD) during three-year follow-up (FU) and potential differences between self-expandable (SEV) and balloon-expandable valves (BEV) under real-world conditions.
METHODS: Endpoints were defined according to VARC-3 criteria, including VARC composite endpoints during three-year FU.
RESULTS: A total of 1233 patients with tricuspid aortic valve stenosis, who underwent TAVR with contemporary transcatheter heart valve (THV) devices from three different tertiary care centers were included. One-fifth of the study population showed BVD at three-year FU (BVD[-]: n = 957;77.6%; BVD[+]: n = 276;22.4%). Non-structural valve deterioration (NSVD) was the most represented category (8.5%) followed by structural valve deterioration (SVD, 5.3%). BVD was more common in association with BEV as compared with SEV (60.9% vs 39.1%; p < 0.001) owing to higher rates of SVD (13.5% vs 9.5%; p = 0.028) and NSVD (17.9% vs. 13.8%; p = 0.048). Subclinical leaflet thrombosis was only documented in BEV (1.7%, p < 0.001). At three years, all-cause mortality was higher in BVD+ patients (BVD[-] vs. BVD[+]: 13.2% vs. 22.5%; HR: 1.99; 95%-CI: 1.39-2.85; p < 0.001*) but did not differ between THV platform.
CONCLUSION: BVD after TAVR is common and associated with higher all-cause mortality. Despite a preponderance of BVD in association with balloon-expandable valves, mortality rates remain similar between THV platforms.

40353871,Predictive performance of the TRI-SCORE in patients with severe aortic stenosis and concomitant tricuspid regurgitation undergoing TAVR.,"BACKGROUND: Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is a common comorbidity in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and represents a significant predictor of adverse outcomes. Precise risk stratification through clinical scoring systems is vital for tailoring treatment decisions in this patient population.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the applicability of the TRI-SCORE for predicting adverse outcomes in patients with AS and concomitant moderate-to-severe TR undergoing TAVR and to compare its performance with established surgical risk scores like the EuroSCORE II and Society of Thoracic Surgeons score (STS-Score).
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 301 patients with severe AS and concomitant TR who underwent TAVR between 2013 and 2022 at the Heart Center Bonn. According to the TRI-SCORE, patients were stratified into a low or intermediate-risk group (TRI-SCORE 0-5) and a high-risk group (TRI-SCORE 6-12). The primary endpoint was 2-year all-cause mortality. Predictive values of the TRI-SCORE were compared to the EuroSCORE II and the STS-Score for both 30-day and 2-year mortality outcomes.
RESULTS: The 2-year mortality rate was significantly higher in the high-risk group compared to the low or intermediate-risk group (TRI-SCORE 6-12: 40.0% vs. TRI-SCORE 0-5: 17.9%; p < 0.001). For predicting 30-day mortality, the EuroSCORE II and the STS-Score demonstrated superior predictive values, with AUCs of 78.4% and 83.0%, respectively, in comparison to the TRI-SCORE, which showed an AUC of 70.0%. Conversely, the TRI-SCORE allowed a better risk prediction with regard to 2-year all-cause mortality, achieving an AUC of 69.7%, superior to the EuroSCORE II (60.6%) and the STS-Score (62.1%).
CONCLUSION: The TRI-SCORE is effective in predicting mid-term mortality in patients with AS and moderate-to-severe TR undergoing TAVR, demonstrating greater robustness than the EuroSCORE II and the STS-Score for this timeframe.","['Mustafa Mousa Basha', 'Baravan Al-Kassou', 'Christopher Gestrich', 'Marcel Weber', 'Thomas Beiert', 'Sebastian Zimmer', 'Farhad Bakhtiary', 'Georg Nickenig', 'Jasmin Shamekhi']",Clinical research in cardiology : official journal of the German Cardiac Society,2025-05-12,10.1007/s00392-025-02671-y,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00392-025-02671-y,PMC5698373,Free,Predictive performance of the TRI SCORE in patients with severe aortic stenosis and concomitant tricuspid regurgitation undergoing TAVR BASHA 2025,pdfs\Predictive performance of the TRI SCORE in patients with severe aortic stenosis and concomitant tricuspid regurgitation undergoing TAVR BASH.pdf,"['patients', 'patients undergoing TAVI', 'TAVI', 'TRV', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'aortic valve', 'mortality', 'aortic valve implantation', 'all-cause mortality', 'undergoing TAVR']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Aortic valve stenosis', 'EuroSCORE II', 'STS-Score', 'TRI-SCORE', 'Transcatheter aortic valve replacement', 'Tricuspid regurgitation']"
40352131,Early Changes in Left Ventricular Myocardial Mechanics After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement for Severe Aortic Stenosis.,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) improves left ventricular (LV) deformation by aortic stenosis (AS). However, the early effects of TAVR on LV mechanics as assessed by echocardiography have not been fully elucidated.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Between 2021 and 2024, we included 81 patients who underwent transfemoral TAVR for severe AS. We used the natural logarithm of B-type natriuretic peptide (lnBNP) 1 week after TAVR as an indicator of the early effects on LV mechanics. To determine the association with echocardiographic parameters (LV ejection fraction [LVEF], global longitudinal strain [GLS], E/e', and Tei index) and postprocedural lnBNP, we used regression models while adjusting for covariates. There were no significant differences in LVEF, GLS or E/e' between before and after TAVR, but the postprocedural Tei index was significantly higher than the preprocedural Tei index (0.40 vs. 0.26, P<0.01). In a univariate linear regression, the preprocedural LVEF (β=-0.28, P=0.01), GLS (β=-0.24, P=0.04), E/e' (β=0.36, P<0.01), and Tei index (β=0.27, P=0.02) correlated with postprocedural lnBNP. Regarding the postprocedural parameters, GLS (β=-0.27, P=0.02) and E/e' (β=0.36, P<0.01) also correlated with postprocedural lnBNP, but the LVEF and Tei index did not. After adjustment for covariates, these correlations remained significant.
CONCLUSIONS: Preprocedural echocardiographic parameters reflecting LV function correlated with BNP after TAVR, but the utility of postprocedural parameters may depend on preprocedural LV function or perioperative factors.","['Takeru Ikenaga', 'Yuta Kato', 'Yuto Kawahira', 'Midori Miyazaki', 'Tetsuo Hirata', 'Hiromitsu Teratani', 'Go Kuwahara', 'Makoto Sugihara', 'Hideichi Wada', 'Masahiro Ogawa', 'Shin-Ichiro Miura']",Circulation reports,2025-05-09,10.1253/circrep.CR-24-0139,https://doi.org/10.1253/circrep.CR-24-0139,PMC12061501,Free,Early Changes in Left Ventricular Myocardial Mechanics After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement for Severe Aortic Stenosis IKENAGA 2025,pdfs\Early Changes in Left Ventricular Myocardial Mechanics After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement for Severe Aortic Stenosis IKENAGA 2025..pdf,"['Tei index', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'TAVR', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Tei', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'Severe Aortic Stenosis', 'postprocedural Tei index', 'preprocedural Tei index', 'Aortic Valve']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Aortic stenosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Tei index', 'Transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"
40351685,Age Differences in Aortic Stenosis.,"Aortic stenosis (AS) is a significant and growing concern, with a prevalence of 2-3% in individuals aged over 65 years. Moreover, with an aging global population, the prevalence is anticipated to double by 2050. Indeed, AS can arise from various etiologies, including calcific trileaflets, congenital valve abnormalities (e.g., bicuspid and unicuspid valves), and post-rheumatic, whereby each has a distinct influence that shapes the onset and progression of the disease. The normal aortic valve has a trilaminar structure comprising the fibrosa, spongiosa, and ventricularis, which work together to maintain its function. In calcific AS, the disease begins with early calcification starting in high mechanical stress areas of the valve and progresses slowly over decades, eventually leading to extensive calcification resulting in impaired valve function. This process involves mechanisms similar to atherosclerosis, including lipid deposition, chronic inflammation, and mineralization. The progression of calcific AS is strongly associated with aging, with additional risk factors including male gender, smoking, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome exacerbating the condition. Conversely, congenital forms of AS, such as bicuspid and unicuspid aortic valves, result in an earlier disease onset, typically 10-20 years earlier than that observed in patients with a normal tricuspid aortic valve. Rheumatic AS, although less common in developed countries due to effective antibiotic treatments, also exhibits age-related characteristics, with an earlier onset in individuals who experienced rheumatic fever in their youth. The only curative therapies currently available are surgical and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). However, these options are sometimes too invasive for older patients; thus, management of AS, particularly in older patients, requires a comprehensive approach that considers age, disease severity, comorbidities, frailty, and each patient's individual needs. Although the valves used in TAVR demonstrate promising midterm durability, long-term data are still required, especially when used in younger individuals, usually with low surgical risk. Moreover, understanding the causes and mechanisms of structural valve deterioration is crucial for appropriate treatment selections, including valve selection and pharmacological therapy, since this knowledge is essential for optimizing the lifelong management of AS.","['Tomoyo Hamana', 'Teruo Sekimoto', 'Aloke V Finn', 'Renu Virmani']",Reviews in cardiovascular medicine,2025-04-12,10.31083/RCM28185,https://doi.org/10.31083/RCM28185,PMC12059746,Free,Age Differences in Aortic Stenosis HAMANA 2025,pdfs\Age Differences in Aortic Stenosis HAMANA 2025.pdf,"['aortic valve', 'Aortic', 'normal aortic valve', 'valve', 'Aortic Stenosis', 'tricuspid aortic valve', 'aortic valve disease', 'normal tricuspid aortic', 'calcific aortic valve', 'aortic valve leaflets']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['aortic stenosis', 'bioprosthetic valve failure', 'calcific aortic valve disease']"
40349944,Explantation of Transcatheter Aortic Bioprostheses in a Very High-Risk Population.,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement explantation is associated with excessive rates of mortality. We describe a high-risk cohort of patients who underwent surgical explant with excellent outcomes at our institution.
METHODS: This is a single center, retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent surgical removal of a transcatheter bioprosthesis between January 2015 and April 2023. Clinical and operative characteristics were reviewed by direct chart review and survival was estimated.
RESULTS: Thirty-three patients underwent device explantation. Mean age was 75 ± 5.9 years. STS-PROM was 7.34 at surgical explant. Eighteen patients (55%) had previous cardiac surgery, with 15 secondary and 3 tertiary sternotomoies. Fourteen patients had prior ViV TAVR. Indications for explantation were prosthetic valve degeneration (46%), endocarditis (33%), paravalvular leak (15%), and ventricular septal defect (6%). Median TAVR valve age was 815 days. Twenty-two patients required a concomitant operation including: mitral valve replacement (21%), aortic operation (9%), coronary bypass grafting (18%), myectomy (6%), and atrial or ventricular septal defect repair (12%). None required aortic root replacement. Mean hospital length of stay was 10 ± 8 days. Postoperative complications included new renal failure (6%), respiratory failure (12%), pacemaker implantation (3%), and reentry for bleeding (3%). No patient suffered a stroke. Thirty-day, 1-year, and 3-year mortality rates were 6%, 18.6%, and 38.4%.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that acceptable outcomes are attainable in a high-risk patient cohort undergoing TAVR explant. It is imperative to identify modifiable risk factors to achieve consistent outcomes as TAVR and device explant continues to rise.","['Sasha A Still', 'Rongbing Xie', 'Panos Vardas', 'Kyle W Eudailey', 'Clifton T Lewis', 'James E Davies']",The Annals of thoracic surgery,2025-05-09,10.1016/j.athoracsur.2025.04.025,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.athoracsur.2025.04.025,,Paid,Explantation of Transcatheter Aortic Bioprostheses in a Very High Risk Population STILL 2025,Not available,"['Transcatheter Aortic Bioprostheses', 'High-Risk Population', 'Aortic Bioprostheses', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'Population', 'Transcatheter', 'Bioprostheses', 'Transcatheter aortic valve', 'patients', 'TAVR']",2025-05-12,Pending,[]
40348949,Risk factors and predictive models for post-operative moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation following transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a machine learning approach.,"BACKGROUND: Post-operative moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation (MR) following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is associated with poor outcomes, yet the factors contributing to this complication are not well understood. This study aimed to identify risk factors and develop predictive models for post-operative MR following TAVR using machine learning (ML) techniques to enhance early detection and intervention.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from patients who underwent TAVR at our center between August 2014 and August 2023. Patients were classified into post-operative and nonpost-operative MR groups based on postprocedural MR severity. Various ML models were evaluated for predictive performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) values were used to interpret predictive patterns and develop a clinically relevant model.
RESULTS: Among the evaluated models, the random forest model exhibited the highest predictive performance for post-operative moderate-to-severe MR after TAVR. Key predictors, which were confirmed by the SHAP analysis as important in the predictive framework, included echocardiographic parameters, blood test results, patient age, and body mass index.
CONCLUSIONS: ML models show promise in predicting post-operative moderate-to-severe MR after TAVR by integrating clinical indicators to enhance predictive accuracy.

40348412,Outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement in bicuspid versus tricuspid aortic stenosis with severe calcification.,"BACKGROUND: The comparative outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in bicuspid versus tricuspid aortic stenosis (AS) with severe calcification remain unclear. This study aimed to compare the safety and efficacy of TAVR in these patient groups.
METHODS: Using data from the Chinese Cardiovascular Association Database-National Transcatheter Valve Therapeutics Registry, we analysed 870 propensity score matched pairs of patients with severe calcification (≥470 mm³) undergoing TAVR between April 2014 and August 2023. Primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 1 year.
RESULTS: No significant differences were observed in technical success (95.1% vs 94.7%), procedural complications or in-hospital outcomes. All-cause mortality at 1 year was similar between bicuspid and tricuspid AS (4.3% vs 5.3%, HR 0.87; log-rank p=0.62). The incidence of stroke (1.5% vs 1.4%), cardiovascular hospitalisation (1.4% vs 1.7%) and moderate-to-severe paravalvular leak (3.5% vs 2.5%) was similar during follow-up. The rate of new permanent pacemaker implantation was higher in bicuspid AS (8.4% vs 5.6%; p=0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: TAVR was observed to be equally safe and effective in bicuspid and tricuspid AS with severe calcification, though bicuspid AS was associated with a higher rate of permanent pacemaker implantation.","['Yinghao Sun', 'Changjin Wang', 'Jie Li', 'Songyuan Luo', 'Shengneng Zheng', 'Bangyuan Yang', 'Jiaohua Chen', 'Ruixin Fan', 'Jianfang Luo']",Heart (British Cardiac Society),2025-05-10,10.1136/heartjnl-2024-324697,https://doi.org/10.1136/heartjnl-2024-324697,,Paid,Outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement in bicuspid versus tricuspid aortic stenosis with severe calcification SUN 2025,Not available,"['transcatheter aortic valve', 'aortic valve replacement', 'versus tricuspid aortic', 'tricuspid aortic stenosis', 'Transcatheter Valve Therapeutics', 'severe calcification', 'transcatheter aortic', 'aortic valve', 'Valve Therapeutics Registry', 'aortic stenosis']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Aortic stenosis', 'Bicuspid aortic valve', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement']"
40348411,"Incidence, predictors and clinical impact of upper gastrointestinal bleeding after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.","BACKGROUND: Upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is common in patients with aortic stenosis due to the combination of acquired type 2A von Willebrand disease and aspirin-based antiplatelet therapy. We aimed to investigate the incidence, predictors and clinical outcomes of late upper GI bleeding in patients undergoing TAVR.
METHODS: In a prospective TAVR registry, patients were stratified according to upper GI bleeding within 1 year of discharge.
RESULTS: Among the 3144 eligible patients, 54 (1.7%) experienced upper GI bleeding after discharge. Of these, 40 patients had major or life-threatening bleeding, while 14 had minor bleeding events. The presence of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter (HRadjusted 2.98; 95% CI 1.65 to 5.38) and previous upper GI bleeding (HRadjusted 3.51; 95% CI 1.51 to 8.19) were independent predictors of upper GI bleeding, while the use of proton pump inhibitors at discharge (HRadjusted 0.49; 95% CI 0.27 to 0.89) and higher haemoglobin levels (1 g/dL increase) (HRadjusted 0.73; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.87) were protective. Patients who experienced major or life-threatening upper GI bleeding had a higher all-cause (73.7% vs 11.4%, HR 5.84; 95% CI 3.41 to 10.02) and cardiovascular mortality (31.6% vs 7.3%, HR 3.87; 95% CI 1.72 to 8.70) compared with those without upper GI bleeding.
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients who underwent TAVR, 1.7% of patients experienced upper GI bleeding within 1 year of discharge. Major or life-threatening upper GI bleeding was associated with an increased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.

PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases were searched until November 2024 for studies reporting PPI incidence within 30 days post-TAVR. A random-effect model was used to pool risk ratios (RR) and standardized mean differences (SDM) for binary and continuous risk factors. Network meta-analysis estimated pooled risk differences (ΔRR) for binary predictors with male sex as the reference. Significant predictors were ranked based on their surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) values. A total of 108 studies comprising 77,538 patients (14,560 requiring PPI) were included. Male sex (RR: 1.13), baseline atrial fibrillation (AF) (RR: 1.12), 2nd degree Mobitz I (RR: 5.16) and Mobitz II (RR: 2.30) atrioventricular blocks (AVB), 3rd degree AVB (RR: 13.46), left anterior (LAHB) (RR: 1.79) and posterior hemiblocks (LPHB) (RR: 2.57), bifascicular block (RR: 2.34), right bundle branch block (RBBB) (RR: 3.20) and intraprocedural AVB (RR: 4.15) were identified as predictors for PPI post-TAVR. The risk of PPI was higher with self-expandable valves (RR: 1.79), subclavian access (RR: 1.75), and 29 mm prostheses (RR: 1.33) compared to balloon-expandable valves, transfemoral access, and 23 mm prostheses. Network meta-analysis ranked 3rd degree AVB (SUCRA <0.01), Mobitz I AVB (SUCRA: 0.14), Mobitz II AVB (SUCRA: 0.33), intraprocedural AVB (SUCRA: 0.42), bifascicular block (SUCRA: 0.48), RBBB (SUCRA: 0.49) and LPHB (SUCRA: 0.54) as major predictors of PPI in descending order of significance.

40348045,Impact of Annulus Size on Bioprosthetic Valve Failure after Self-Expanding Transcatheter Heart Valves Replacement.,"There is limited evidence on the prognosis and long-term valve durability after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in patients with small aortic annulus (SAA) and large aortic annulus (LAA). This analysis was sought to evaluate the impact of annular size differences on patients' and valve outcomes. A total of 1,211 patients undergoing TAVR using self-expandable transcatheter heart valve (SE-THV) were retrospectively analyzed. The cut-off for SAA was defined as annulus perimeter of < 72 mm. The primary endpoints were all-cause mortality and bioprosthetic valve failure (BVF) between the SAA and LAA groups. As a sub-analysis, the impact of post-procedural mean pressure gradient (mPG) ≥ 20mmHg and severe prosthesis-patient mismatch (PPM) on these outcomes were also evaluated. Of all patients, 60.1% (n=723) had SAA. At 7 years after TAVR, the SAA group had lower incidence of all-cause mortality (53.7% vs. 63.7%, log-rank p=0.05) and lower event rate of BVF than LAA (1.2% vs. 4.6%, p=0.01 for Gray's test). Multivariate Cox-regression and Fine-Gray competing risk regression analysis demonstrated the presence of SAA was related to better prognosis (Hazard ratio [HR]: 0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.67 to 0.98) and lower BVF (adjusted subdistribution HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.98). There were no impact of post-procedural mPG ≥ 20 mmHg or severe PPM on the difference of mortality and BVF. Further, these results were consistent in the patients with SAAs.

OBJECTIVES: This study sought to investigate the 1-year outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement using the intra-annular NAV and the ULTRA THVs.
METHODS: The NAVULTRA (Navitor and SAPIEN 3 Ultra) registry included consecutive patients who underwent transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement at 16 centers with NAV or ULTRA between November 2018 and April 2024. Propensity score matching was used for adjustment. The primary outcomes of interest were all-cause death and the composite of all-cause death, disabling stroke, and hospitalization for heart failure at 1 year.
RESULTS: The overall study cohort included 3,878 patients treated with NAV (n = 1,746) or ULTRA (n = 2,176). The propensity score-matched population resulted in 1,363 pairs. At 1 year, the rate of death from any cause was 9.7% with NAV and 9.9% with ULTRA (adjusted P = 0.585). Similarly, there were no significant differences in primary composite outcome (13.6% in the NAV group and 12.6% in the ULTRA group; adjusted P = 0.218). The rate of new permanent pacemaker implantation (20.6% vs 10.6%; adjusted P < 0.01) and heart failure rehospitalization (4.6% vs 2.8%; adjusted P < 0.05) was higher in NAV group. At 1 year, the use of NAV was associated with higher rates of mild paravalvular leak (OR: 1.53; 95% CI: 1.01 to 2.33; adjusted P < 0.05) but lower mean transprosthetic gradients compared with ULTRA (mean change:-3.90, 95% CI: -4.47 to -3.34; adjusted P < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Both intra-annular THVs were associated with similar 1-year clinical outcomes; however, differences were observed in secondary clinical endpoints and valve hemodynamic performance.","['Stefano Cannata', 'Ibrahim Sultan', 'Nicolas Van Mieghem', 'Arturo Giordano', 'Ole De Backer', 'Johnathan Byrne', 'Didier Tchetche', 'Sergio Buccheri', 'Luis Nombela-Franco', 'Rui Campante Teles', 'Marco Barbanti', 'Emanuele Barbato', 'Ignacio Amat Santos', 'Daniel J Blackman', 'Francesco Maisano', 'Roberto Lorusso', 'Ketty La Spina', 'Antonella Millin', 'Dustin E Kliner', 'Mark van den Dorpel', 'Elena Acerbi', 'Davorka Lulic', 'Kaivalya Divekar', 'Vincenzo Cesario', 'Jorge Francisco Chavez Solsol', 'Joao Brito', 'Giuliano Costa', 'Matteo Casenghi', 'Clara Fernandez Cordon', 'Amanda Sherwen', 'Nicola Buzzatti', 'Salvatore Pasta', 'Marco Turrisi', 'Michele Minacori', 'Paolo Manca', 'Vincenzo Nuzzi', 'Corrado Tamburino', 'Francesco Bedogni', 'Caterina Gandolfo', 'Azeem Latib']",JACC.

40347197,Rotational Atherectomy of Aorto-Ostial Calcification and Retained Native Leaflet to Facilitate Valve-in-Valve TAVI.,"BACKGROUND: A 72-year-old patient presented with breathlessness and presyncope due to severe stenosis within a 25-mm Perimount bioprosthetic aortic valve. The patient had hepatic cirrhosis and was not a candidate for redo surgical valve replacement. A computed tomography transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) demonstrated severe aorto-ostial left main calcific disease, with dense calcification from the annulus to the inferior border of the left main ostium, which was thought to represent a retained native leaflet, with high risk of coronary obstruction.
CASE SUMMARY: Using cerebral protection, rotational atherectomy was undertaken through the aorto-ostial calcification and retained leaflet, followed by left main stem percutaneous coronary intervention. A staged TAVI with a 23-mm Sapien S3 and a chimney stent for coronary protection was successful.
DISCUSSION: Although concomitant left main stem rotational atherectomy and TAVI have been described, no reports of rotablation to facilitate leaflet modification have been identified.
TAKE-HOME MESSAGES: Rotational atherectomy helped to modify the retained aortic valve leaflet and safely facilitate TAVI in a nonsurgical candidate.","['Andrew R Chapman', 'Lance Ng', 'Shaw Hua Kueh', 'Peter Barr', 'Jonathon White', 'Mark Webster']",JACC.

40345873,Immediate transcatheter aortic valve replacement versus temporizing balloon aortic valvuloplasty in severe aortic stenosis: A systematic review and meta-analysis immediate TAVR vs. temporizing BAV.,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a first-line therapy for severe aortic stenosis (AS). In patients with contraindications to immediate TAVR, temporizing balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) may be performed to stabilize patients prior to TAVR. The relative efficacy and safety of TAVR with or without temporizing BAV remains inadequately described.
METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases for studies comparing TAVR with and without temporizing BAV in patients with severe AS. Random-effects models were used to calculate pooled odds, risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: Nine studies (59,205 patients: 95.7 % immediate TAVR, 4.3 % BAV + TAVR) met inclusion criteria. Mean age was 82.9 ± 6.6 years old, and 45.9 % were males. Patients in the TAVR group were a mean difference of 1 year younger with no difference in gender distribution between groups. Direct TAVR was associated with a lower risk of 30-day all-cause mortality than BAV + TAVR (RR = 0.62; 95 % CI 0.41 to 0.93; p = 0.02). There were no significant differences in risks of post-procedural pacemaker implantation, myocardial infarction, cardiac tamponade, major vascular complications, ischemic stroke, major bleeding, 2+ or greater aortic regurgitation grade or acute kidney injury.
CONCLUSION: While immediate TAVR was associated with slightly lower short-term mortality compared to BAV + TAVR in patients with severe AS, other binary endpoints were equivalent. This potential mortality difference should be considered when offering BAV + TAVR in patients with contraindications to immediate TAVR. Randomized studies are required to confirm these results.","['Mohamed Doma', 'Wilbert Huang', 'Sarai Hernandez', 'Syeda Rubab Fatima', 'Shanmukh Lingamsetty', 'Mangesh Kritya', 'Maya Hemdanieh', 'Zahra Naji', 'Douglas Mesadri Gewehr', 'Felipe Villa Martignoni', 'Andrew M Goldsweig']",Cardiovascular revascularization medicine : including molecular interventions,2025-04-29,10.1016/j.carrev.2025.04.019,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.carrev.2025.04.019,,Paid,Immediate transcatheter aortic valve replacement versus temporizing balloon aortic valvuloplasty in severe aortic stenosis A systematic review and meta analysis immediate TAVR vs temporizing BAV DOMA 2025,Not available,"['transcatheter aortic valve', 'TAVR', 'aortic valve replacement', 'severe aortic stenosis', 'temporizing balloon aortic', 'valve replacement versus', 'transcatheter aortic', 'balloon aortic valvuloplasty', 'BAV', 'temporizing BAV']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Aortic stenosis', 'Balloon aortic valvuloplasty', 'Transcatheter aortic valve implantation']"
40345731,Orthotopic Left Main Chimney Stenting to Prevent Stent Compression After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.,"Coronary obstruction (CO) is a severe complication of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). An 80-year-old woman presenting with severe aortic stenosis was referred for TAVR. A preprocedural computed tomography revealed risk factors for CO: narrow aortic root and borderline-low coronary height. During TAVR, both coronaries were protected. After transcatheter heart valve (THV) implantation, contrast staining of the left sinus and leaflet interaction with the left main (LM) ostium were noted, prompting LM stenting to prevent obstruction. Because the THV-aorta space was virtual, we opted for rewiring and LM stenting through a THV cell. A postprocedural computed tomograohy revealed a permeable, well-expanded stent. Chimney stenting between the THV and aorta may be unfeasible in patients with a narrow aorta because of a risk of stent compression. Orthotopic chimney stenting through a THV cell may be preferable to classic chimney stenting in patients with a narrow aorta and minimal THV-aorta space.","['Ruxandra I Sava', 'Hakim Benamer', 'Julien Quillet', 'Maximilien Sochala', 'Philippe M Garot', 'Mariama Akodad']",JACC.

40345648,Balloon-Expandable versus Self-Expanding Valves in Patients With Prior Surgical Mitral Valve Replacement Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.,"BACKGROUND: Preexisting mitral prosthesis raises technical challenges for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) but has been scarcely studied. This study sought to compare outcomes of patients with previous surgical mitral valve prostheses undergoing TAVR with balloon-expandable (BEV) or self-expanding valve (SEV) systems.
METHODS: Patients from the Spanish TAVR registry with preexisting surgical mitral prostheses were included. The primary endpoints were Valve Academic Research Consortium-3 technical and device success and were analyzed according to valve type. The rates of transcatheter heart valve (THV) embolization, mitral valve impingement, THV performance and pacemaker were also assessed.
RESULTS: A total of 243 patients were included (BEV: 37%; SEV: 63%). Overall technical success was 95.9%. 30-day device success was higher in BEV patients (94.4% vs 85.0%, p=0.036), mainly driven by lower incidences of moderate residual aortic regurgitation (0% vs 5.9%, p=0.028) and THV embolization (0% vs 3.9%, p=0.087). BEV recipients exhibited higher mean transvalvular gradients (10.5 vs 8.1 mmHg, p=0.002) and lower rates of permanent pacemaker implantation (5.6% vs 15.7%, p=0.023). There were no differences in mortality, bleeding or readmission at 30 days. In multivariate analysis, a mitroaortic distance ≤7 mm and lack of transesophageal echocardiography guidance were associated with increased device failure.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with preexisting MV prostheses, TAVR was safe and effective regardless of the THV type. Nevertheless, the use of BEVs resulted in a greater rate of device success driven by lesser THV embolization and residual aortic regurgitation.","['Lluis Asmarats', 'Pilar Jiménez-Quevedo', 'Ignacio J Amat-Santos', 'María-Cruz Ferrer-Gracia', 'Fernando Sarnago', 'Juan H Alonso-Briales', 'Juan Francisco Oteo', 'Vicenç Serra', 'Guillem Muntané-Carol', 'Victoria Vilalta', 'David Del Val', 'Manuel Pan', 'José M De la Torre Hernández', 'Sergio García-Blas', 'José Luis Díez', 'Alberto Berenguer', 'Raquel Del Valle', 'Felipe Navarro Del Amo', 'Miguel Artaiz', 'Ander Regueiro', 'Manuel López-Pérez', 'Albert Massó van-Roessel', 'José G Paredes-Vázquez', 'Clara Fernández-Cordón', 'José Antonio Diarte de Miguel', 'Nicolás Maneiro', 'Alberto Piserra-López', 'Jorge de la Fuente', 'Juan Muñoz', 'Rafael Romaguera', 'Xavier Carrillo', 'Fernando Alfonso', 'Marco Alvarado', 'Gabriela Veiga', 'Xavier Millán', 'Luis Nombela-Franco', 'Dabit Arzamendi']",The Canadian journal of cardiology,2025-05-07,10.1016/j.cjca.2025.04.026,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2025.04.026,,Paid,Balloon Expandable versus Self Expanding Valves in Patients With Prior Surgical Mitral Valve Replacement Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement ASMARATS 2025,Not available,"['Prior Surgical Mitral', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Replacement Undergoing Transcatheter', 'Valve Replacement Undergoing', 'Valve Replacement', 'Mitral Valve Replacement', 'Surgical Mitral Valve', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Prior Surgical', 'Valve']",2025-05-12,Pending,[]
40343748,Bicuspid aortic valve disease: advancements and challenges of transcatheter aortic valve implantation.,"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has revolutionized the treatment of patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS). Initially developed for patients with tricuspid aortic valve (TAV) anatomy, the procedural success and expanding indications of TAVI have spurred interest in its application to more complex aortic valve anatomies, such as the bicuspid aortic valve (BAV). The growing interest in this specific sub-set of patients with AS is driven by the recent extension of TAVI indications to younger individuals, who exhibit a notably higher incidence of bicuspid anatomy compared with older populations. Bicuspid aortic valves present distinct anatomical and pathological complexities that pose significant challenges to the conventional TAVI approach. These include asymmetric calcification, aortic root dilation (also known as BAV aortopathy), and variations in cusp fusion patterns, which can affect valve deployment, transcatheter heart valve sealing, and long-term durability. Despite these challenges, advancements in imaging techniques, valve design, and procedural strategies have led to increased adoption of TAVI in BAV patients. However, surgical aortic valve replacement still retains a more prominent role in this group compared with patients with TAVs. This preference is partly due to the exclusion of BAV patients from almost all previous randomized controlled trials, which limits the available evidence supporting the use of TAVI in this unique cohort. This state-of-the-art review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current landscape of TAVI in BAV patients, including an analysis of anatomical considerations and procedural pitfalls, as well as outcomes' improvements with new device iterations. It will also explore clinical data, tackling the risks, benefits, and the evolving role of TAVI in this unique patient cohort.","['Marco Barbanti', 'Giuliano Costa', 'Stephan Windecker', 'Francesco Maisano', 'Giulia Laterra', 'Jonathon Leipsic', 'Philipp Blanke', 'Vinayak N Bapat', 'Martin B Leon', 'John G Webb']",European heart journal,2025-05-09,10.1093/eurheartj/ehaf307,https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehaf307,,Paid,Bicuspid aortic valve disease advancements and challenges of transcatheter aortic valve implantation BARBANTI 2025,Not available,"['aortic valve implantation', 'aortic valve', 'TAVI', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'aortic', 'aortic valve disease', 'Bicuspid aortic valve', 'valve', 'BAV patients', 'Bicuspid aortic']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Aortopathy', 'Bicuspid aortic valve', 'Bioprosthesis', 'Congenital heart disease', 'Sizing', 'TAVI', 'Transcatheter aortic valve implantation']"
40340592,Characterization of Aortic Valve Stenosis by CT Angiography in a Diverse US Cohort.,"BACKGROUND: Aortic stenosis (AS) involves calcific and fibrotic degeneration of the valve tissue. The only noninvasive method for evaluating both processes is contrast-enhanced computed tomography angiography. We aimed to explore the differences in aortic valve (AV) tissue composition across sex, race/ethnicity, and AS hemodynamic phenotype in US patients referred for transcatheter AV replacement planning.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed symptomatic patients with AS who underwent computed tomography angiography for transcatheter AV replacement planning between 2015 and 2022. Using semi-automated software, we quantified the AV tissue composition by fibrotic, calcific, and fibro-calcific volumes, and the fibro-calcific ratio (fibrotic/calcific volume) as a measure of valve phenotype.
RESULTS: The study included 651 patients (mean age 84 years; 55% women) with 38% non-Hispanic (NH)-White, 27% Hispanic, and 13% NH-Black. Women had lower fibro-calcific (230 versus 293 mm³/cm²; P<0.001) and calcific volumes (85 versus 149 mm³/cm²; P<0.001), and higher fibro-calcific ratio (1.47 versus 0.83; P<0.001). No differences were observed in the fibrotic volumes (P=0.805). NH-White women had higher fibro-calcific (256 mm³/cm², P=0.002) and fibrotic volumes (145 mm³/cm²; P<0.001), and fibro-calcific ratio (1.57; P=0.01) compared with Hispanic and NH-Black women. No differences were found among men. High-gradient AS had higher fibro-calcific (295 versus 219 mm3/cm2; P<0.001) and calcific volumes (148 versus 88 mm3/cm2; P<0.001), and a lower fibro-calcific ratio (0.90 versus 1.45; P<0.001), although no difference in fibrotic volume (P=0.099) compared with low-gradient AS.
CONCLUSIONS: Phenotypic differences in computed tomography angiography valve tissue composition exist in AS patients referred for transcatheter AV replacement, with females and low-gradient AS showing a proportionally more fibrotic phenotype. NH-White women have the highest fibrotic tissue composition, and no differences are evident among men.","['Daniel Lorenzatti', 'Annalisa Filtz', 'Pamela Pina', 'Jolien Geers', 'Jake Gilman', 'Jonathan Daich', 'Paul Ippolito', 'Aftab Abdullah', 'Aldo L Schenone', 'Carlos A Gongora', 'Justin Johannesen', 'Andrea Scotti', 'Edwin C Ho', 'Mario J Garcia', 'Azeem Latib', 'Carlos J Rodriguez', 'Daniel S Berman', 'Marie-Annick Clavel', 'Philippe Pibarot', 'Robert O Bonow', 'Piotr J Slomka', 'Marc R Dweck', 'Damini Dey', 'Leandro Slipczuk']",Circulation.

40337394,Transcaval access for transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Transfemoral access is considered the standard route for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). However, in some cases, this access route is contraindicated. Alternative access routes, such as transaxillary, are emerging as first-line approaches to address these limitations, while the transcaval approach remains uncertain. Our Meta-analysis aims to evaluate the safety of the transcaval approach compared to other access routes for TAVR.
METHODS: We searched five databases, PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Embase, from inception until April 2024 for any study that reports transcaval access alone or compares it to any alternative access in TAVR patients. We used Risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and Mean Difference (MD) for continuous outcomes with a 95% confidence interval.
RESULTS: Eleven studies with 1003 patients were included, transcaval showed non-statistically significant difference over alternatives in terms of intra-hospital, 30 days, and long-term all-cause mortality with a RR of 0.08 (95% CI -0.83 to 0.99, P = 0.86), 0.11 (95% CI -0.48 to 0.7, P = 0.71), and 1.08 (95% CI -0.50 to 2.66, P = 0.18), respectively. Furthermore, in our single-arm analysis, transcaval access has a low pooled 30-day all-cause mortality rate of 7% (95% CI 5-10) and long-term mortality of 21% (95% CI 2-77). The mean difference in length of stay in the hospital after the operation was 4.88 (95% CI 4.45-5.31), and the major bleeding rate was 14% (95% CI 8-23).
CONCLUSION: Transcaval access for TAVR is a safe and feasible method that can be considered a new alternative when trans-femoral access is contraindicated.","['Zina Otmani', 'Ahmad Alzawahreh', 'Abdelaziz A Awad', 'Basma Badrawy Khalefa', 'Hazem Ayman Elsayed', 'Omar Hany Mohamed Amin', 'Mohamed Abouzid', 'Amjad Almansi', 'Ayman K Awad']",Annals of medicine and surgery (2012),2025-05-12,10.1097/MS9.0000000000003193,https://doi.org/10.1097/MS9.0000000000003193,PMC12055168,Free,Transcaval access for transcatheter aortic valve replacement a systematic review and meta analysis OTMANI 2025,pdfs\Transcaval access for transcatheter aortic valve replacement a systematic review and meta analysis OTMANI 2025.pdf,"['Transcaval access', 'access', 'Transcaval', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'aortic valve replacement', 'aortic valve', 'TAVR', 'transcatheter aortic', 'mortality', 'aortic']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['meta-analysis', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement', 'transcaval']"
40336935,When the heart becomes suicidal: a case report of severe left ventricular outflow tract obstruction following transcatheter aortic valve implantation.,"BACKGROUND: Replacement of the aortic valve is a Class I recommendation for treatment of patients suffering from severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis. However, aortic valve replacement can occasionally lead to complications, including development of acute left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction. This rare but severe complication is referred to as the so-called 'suicide left ventricle' phenomenon.
CASE SUMMARY: This case report presents an 88-year-old woman who developed severe LVOT obstruction following a successful transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), complicated by septal anterior motion of the mitral valve resulting in severe mitral regurgitation. Despite initial intensive care management, her symptoms persisted, necessitating the application of transcoronary ablation of septal hypertrophy as a bail-out procedure. Transcoronary ablation of septal hypertrophy, typically used in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, successfully reduced the LVOT gradient and relieved symptoms.
DISCUSSION: This case emphasizes the importance of pre-operative identification of LVOT obstruction risk factors, awareness for this complication and a well-experience multidisciplinary team for the management of TAVI-associated complications.","['Carl Schulz', 'Fabian J Brunner', 'Simon Pecha', 'Nils Sörensen', 'Niklas Schofer']",European heart journal.

40334981,Prevalence and clinical outcomes of permanent conduction disturbances after Transcatheter aortic valve replacement.,"BACKGROUND: A new-onset conduction disturbance is a major concern in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) but can resolve over time. This study aimed to evaluate the recovery in conduction disturbances post-TAVR and its association with clinical outcomes.
METHODS: This retrospective study included 780 TAVR patients at St. Marianna University between January 2016 and March 2023. Patients were stratified into four groups based on conduction status at six months post-TAVR: no conduction disturbance, recovered conduction disturbance [defined as a post-procedural pacemaker implantation with cumulative right ventricular pacing <40 % or complete left bundle branch block (CLBBB) at discharge but not at six months], permanent conduction disturbance (defined as pacemaker implantation with cumulative right ventricular pacing ≥40 % or CLBBB at both discharge and six months), and preprocedural conduction disturbance. The primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalization. The secondary outcome was the change in cardiac damage from pre-procedure to one-year post-TAVR.
RESULTS: Of 780 patients, 220 (28 %) had new-onset CLBBB or required a pacemaker implantation at discharge. Among these, 99 (45 %) had permanent conduction disturbances at six months. Over a median follow-up of 788 days, both permanent and preprocedural conduction disturbances were significantly associated with a higher incidence of heart failure hospitalization [hazard ratio (HR) 3.63; 95 % confidence interval (CI): 2.04-6.47, p < 0.01 and HR 2.50; 95 % CI: 1.27-4.90, p < 0.01), although no difference in all-cause mortality was observed. In contrast, the prognosis of patients with recovered conduction disturbance was comparable with those with no conduction disturbance. Patients with permanent and preprocedural conduction disturbances showed significant worsening cardiac damage.
CONCLUSION: Permanent and preprocedural conduction disturbances after TAVR were associated with increased heart failure hospitalizations, while the prognostic impact of recovered conduction disturbance may be limited.","['Takahiko Kai', 'Masaki Izumo', 'Masahiro Sekiguchi', 'Tetsu Tanaka', 'Taishi Okuno', 'Yukio Sato', 'Shingo Kuwata', 'Masashi Koga', 'Ikutaro Nakajima', 'Kenichi Sasaki', 'Yasuhiro Tanabe', 'Tomoo Harada', 'Yoshihiro J Akashi']",Journal of cardiology,2025-05-05,10.1016/j.jjcc.2025.04.013,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jjcc.2025.04.013,,Paid,Prevalence and clinical outcomes of permanent conduction disturbances after Transcatheter aortic valve replacement KAI 2025,Not available,"['Transcatheter aortic valve', 'aortic valve replacement', 'conduction disturbance', 'conduction', 'Transcatheter aortic', 'preprocedural conduction disturbances', 'undergoing transcatheter aortic', 'valve replacement', 'preprocedural conduction', 'recovered conduction disturbance']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Aortic stenosis', 'Conduction disturbance', 'Transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"
40329985,Assessment of the Impact of Dexmedetomidine on Myocardial Injury in TAVI Patients: A Retrospective Cohort Study Utilizing PSM-DID.,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) is a minimally invasive procedure for treating severe aortic valve diseases but can lead to perioperative myocardial damage (PMD). Dexmedetomidine (DEX), an α2-adrenergic receptor agonist, has shown potential to reduce myocardial injury in other cardiac procedures. This effect is attributed to its anti-inflammatory properties, which help reduce the inflammatory response associated with myocardial damage, and its antioxidant properties, which combat oxidative stress that contributes to cell injury. But its effectiveness during TAVI remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of DEX on myocardial injury in patients undergoing TAVI under general anesthesia.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of 159 patients (after exclusions) who underwent TAVI from January 2022 to August 2024. Patients were divided into DEX and control groups. Primary outcomes were peak levels of cardiac troponin I and CK-MB within 48 hours postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included IL-6, PCT, and NT-proBNP levels. Propensity score matching (PSM) and Differences-in-Differences (DID) method were used for analysis.
RESULTS: After PSM, the DEX group exhibited significantly lower peak values of troponin I (P < 0.001) and CK-MB (P < 0.001) compared to the control group, indicating reduced myocardial injury. No significant differences were observed in IL-6, PCT, and NT-proBNP levels between the groups. The DID analysis suggested a negative correlation between DEX use and major adverse postoperative events, highlighting DEX as a potential protective factor.
CONCLUSION: Dexmedetomidine administration during TAVI was associated with reduced levels of myocardial injury markers, indicating a potential cardioprotective role. By reducing myocardial injury, DEX may contribute to improved perioperative outcomes, including a decreased risk of major adverse postoperative events. These results highlight the potential clinical utility of DEX in the perioperative management of TAVI patients, suggesting that its inclusion in anesthetic protocols could enhance patient care and recovery.","['Yang Song', 'Jin Zhang', 'Huiping Xu', 'Chaoqun Gui', 'Hao Cheng', 'Yongquan Chen', 'Shaolin Wang']",Therapeutics and clinical risk management,2025-05-12,10.2147/TCRM.S507439,https://doi.org/10.2147/TCRM.S507439,PMC12053920,Free,Assessment of the Impact of Dexmedetomidine on Myocardial Injury in TAVI Patients A Retrospective Cohort Study Utilizing PSM DID SONG 2025,pdfs\Assessment of the Impact of Dexmedetomidine on Myocardial Injury in TAVI Patients A Retrospective Cohort Study Utilizing PSM DID SONG 2025.p.pdf,"['Myocardial Injury', 'DEX', 'Myocardial', 'TAVI', 'TAVI Patients', 'Injury', 'Patients', 'DEX group', 'patients undergoing TAVI', 'Retrospective Cohort Study']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['dexmedetomidine', 'inflammation', 'myocardial ischemia', 'propensity score', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"
40328542,Semiquantitative metrics of coronary artery disease burden: Intra-individual comparison between ultrahigh-resolution photon-counting detector CT and energy-integrating detector CT.,"BACKGROUND: Quantitative coronary stenosis and plaque volumes have demonstrated intra-individual differences between ultrahigh-resolution (UHR) photon-counting detector (PCD)-CT and energy-integrating detector (EID)-CT. This study aimed to assess the impact of UHR PCD-CT on semiquantitative scores of coronary artery disease (CAD) burden compared with EID-CT.
METHODS: Patients undergoing coronary CT angiography (CCTA) on an EID-CT system for stable chest pain or pre-transcatheter aortic valve replacement evaluation were prospectively enrolled for UHR PCD-CT scan within 30 days. Both datasets were visually evaluated using five established semiquantitative scores: Segment Involvement Score (SIS), Segment Stenosis Score (SSS), Multivessel Aggregate Stenosis Score (MVAS), CCTA-adapted Leaman score (CT-LeSc), and Coronary Artery Disease Reporting and Data System (CAD-RADS). Additionally, the total number of detected plaques and high-risk features were reported (positive remodeling, spotty calcification, low-attenuation, and napkin-ring sign).
RESULTS: The cohort comprised 46 patients (37 men, 68.4 ​± ​6.9 years). When assessing stenosis severity, PCD-CT showed lower SSS (3.5 [1.3-5.0] vs 6.5 [3.0-9.8], p ​< ​0.001), MVAS (5.5 [4.0-7.0] vs 7.0 [5.0-9.0], p ​< ​0.001), and CT-LeSc (10.4 [8.5-13.9] vs 11.2 [8.8-15.4], p ​= ​0.032). Furthermore, 52 ​% (24/46) of patients were reclassified to a lower CAD-RADS category compared to EID-CT. In terms of CAD extent, PCD-CT demonstrated higher SIS (8.0 [6.0-9.0] vs 7.0 [6.0-8.8], p ​= ​0.018) and plaque count (9.0 [7.0-13.8] vs 7.0 [7.0-9.8] p ​< ​0.001). Positive remodeling was less frequent in PCD-CT datasets (2.0 [1.0-4.3] vs 1.0 [0.0-3.0], p ​= ​0.012), with no significant differences in other high-risk features.
CONCLUSION: The use of UHR PCD-CT detects less severe, but more extensive CAD compared to EID-CT. The effect of such CCTA-based differences on individual risk stratification needs further investigation.","['Giuseppe Tremamunno', 'Akos Varga-Szemes', 'U Joseph Schoepf', 'Dmitrij Kravchenko', 'Muhammad Taha Hagar', 'Chiara Gnasso', 'Emese Zsarnóczay', ""Jim O'Doherty"", 'Damiano Caruso', 'Andrea Laghi', 'Bálint Szilveszter', 'Borbála Vattay', 'Pál Maurovich-Horvat', 'Ismail Mikdat Kabakus', 'Pal Spruill Suranyi', 'Tilman Emrich', 'Milan Vecsey-Nagy']",Journal of cardiovascular computed tomography,2025-05-05,10.1016/j.jcct.2025.04.012,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcct.2025.04.012,,Paid,Semiquantitative metrics of coronary artery disease burden Intra individual comparison between ultrahigh resolution photon counting detector CT and energy integrating detector CT TREMAMUNNO 2025,Not available,"['coronary artery disease', 'ultrahigh-resolution photon-counting detector', 'energy-integrating detector', 'artery disease', 'coronary artery', 'Quantitative coronary stenosis', 'photon-counting detector', 'Artery Disease Reporting', 'UHR PCD-CT', 'artery disease burden']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Atherosclerotic plaque', 'Computed tomography angiography', 'Coronary artery disease', 'Coronary stenosis', 'Photon-counting detector', 'Ultrahigh-resolution']"
40328422,Outcomes of Surgical versus Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Patients with Low-Flow Low-Gradient Aortic Stenosis.,"OBJECTIVE: This study sought to determine the impact of surgical (SAVR) versus transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in patients with low-flow low-gradient (LFLG) aortic stenosis (AS).
METHODS: This was an observational study of consecutive AVRs for severe AS from 2010 to 2023. Patients with LFLG (aortic valve mean gradient <40 mmHg and a stroke volume index <35 ml/m2) were included. Both classical (ejection fraction <50%) and paradoxical (ejection fraction ≥50%) subtypes were included. Concomitant procedures and history of prior AVR were excluded. Patients were dichotomized by intervention.
RESULTS: A total of 575 patients underwent isolated, first-time AVR for LFLG AS, of which 248 (43%) were low operative risk (STS-PROM <4%). 131 (52.8%) underwent SAVR and 117 (47.2%) underwent TAVR. The TAVR patients were older than the SAVR patients: 79.0 [76.0-84.0] years vs. 66.0 [59.0-73.0] years, p<0.001. The incidence of 30-day mortality, stroke, and pacemaker were no different across each group, but the incidence of PVL was higher in the TAVR group. At 1-year follow-up, aortic valve mean gradient (9.0 [7.0-12.0] mmHg) and ejection fraction (55.0% [40.0-60.0]) were no different across each group. On multivariable analysis, TAVR was not associated with an increased hazard of death compared to SAVR (HR 1.38, 95% CI: 0.72, 2.66, p=0.34) and it was not associated with an increased hazard of heart failure readmission (HR 1.70, 95% CI: 0.88, 3.30, p=0.11), compared to SAVR.
CONCLUSIONS: For patients with LFLG AS, surgical and transcatheter approaches to AVR may be equally as advantageous with respect to long-term outcomes.","['James A Brown', 'Eishan Ashwat', 'Nav Warraich', 'Nidhi Iyanna', 'Derek Serna-Gallegos', 'Dustin Kliner', 'Catalin Toma', 'David West', 'Amber Makani', 'Irsa Hasan', 'Takuya Ogami', 'Danial Ahmad', 'Floyd Thoma', 'Yisi Wang', 'Ibrahim Sultan']",The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,2025-04-23,10.1016/j.jtcvs.2025.04.034,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcvs.2025.04.034,,Paid,Outcomes of Surgical versus Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Patients with Low Flow Low Gradient Aortic Stenosis BROWN 2025,Not available,"['Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'versus Transcatheter Aortic', 'Low-Gradient Aortic Stenosis', 'Aortic Valve', 'Aortic Stenosis', 'Surgical versus Transcatheter', 'Low-Flow Low-Gradient Aortic', 'Valve Replacement', 'Transcatheter Aortic']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['aortic stenosis', 'surgical aortic valve replacement', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"
40325986,Prognostic implications and predictive factors of subclinical leaflet thrombosis following valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve implantation.,"BACKGROUND: Subclinical leaflet thrombosis, as indicated by hypoattenuated leaflet thickening (HALT) on computed tomography (CT) imaging, remains a major concern owing to its potential impact on valve function and patient outcomes.
AIMS: We aimed to evaluate the association between HALT and clinical outcomes in patients undergoing valve-in-valve (ViV) transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) with balloon-expandable valves and to identify predictors of leaflet thrombosis.
METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent ViV TAVI with balloon-expandable valves at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center were retrospectively analysed. We analysed both pre- and postprocedural CT scans to identify predictors of HALT at 1 month after ViV TAVI and the association of HALT with clinical outcomes. The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause mortality, hospitalisation for heart failure (HF), or stroke at 3 years.
RESULTS: Among the 117 patients analysed, HALT was detected in 37 (31.6%). In the multivariable analysis, anticoagulation therapy (odds ratio [OR] 0.28, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.08-0.92; p=0.037) and greater transcatheter heart valve (THV) expansion at the minimum area level (OR 0.95, 95% CI: 0.91-0.99; p=0.026) were significant predictors of reduced HALT following ViV TAVI. While there was no significant difference in all-cause mortality between patients with and without HALT (OR 1.13, 95% CI: 0.42-3.02; p=0.8), those with HALT had a significantly higher incidence of the composite primary outcome (OR 2.31, 95% CI: 1.04-5.15; p=0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: HALT was frequently observed in patients who underwent ViV TAVI. Additionally, the presence of HALT correlated with a higher incidence of composite outcomes, including all-cause mortality, hospitalisation for HF, and stroke.

AIMS: We sought to assess the association between quantitative CTA features of HALT and its evolution over time in a real-world cohort after TAVI.
METHODS: Among 612 patients who underwent CTA 30 days post-TAVI with balloon-expandable bioprostheses, HALT was detected in 118 (19%). We prospectively followed 99 patients who had undergone a second CTA at 1 year to assess HALT progression. Thrombus volume and mean attenuation were quantified using semiautomated software, and various parameters of bioprosthetic deformation were analysed.
RESULTS: Complete resolution of HALT was observed in 43 patients. Multivariate logistic regression showed that lower thrombus attenuation was an independent predictor of HALT resolution (odds ratio [OR] 0.45; p=0.030), along with the eccentricity index (OR 0.42; p=0.003), deformation index (OR 0.53; p=0.005), and implant canting (OR 1.88; p=0.026). In the 56 patients without complete HALT resolution, thrombus evolution was visually categorised as regression (48%), stability (29%), or progression (23%). In a quantitative assessment, regression was associated with a significant decrease in thrombus volume (291 mmÂ³ to 130 mmÂ³; p=0.007), while progression showed an increase (187 mmÂ³ to 667 mmÂ³; p=0.005). The change in thrombus volume between 30 days and 1 year correlated with the magnitude of changes in mean transvalvular gradients over the same period (r=0.462; p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative thrombus characterisation on CTA is predictive of HALT resolution and correlates with the haemodynamic performance of transcatheter aortic valves.","['Kajetan Grodecki', 'Damini Dey', 'Jolien Geers', 'Jacek Kwiecinski', 'Guadalupe Flores Tomasino', 'Vivek Patel', 'Caroline Park', 'Emily Xing', 'Dhairya Patel', 'Kazuki Suruga', 'Aakriti Gupta', 'Mamoo Nakamura', 'Mitch Gheorghiu', 'Tarun Chakravarty', 'Daniel Berman', 'Piotr Slomka', 'Hasan Jilaihawi', 'Raj R Makkar']",EuroIntervention : journal of EuroPCR in collaboration with the Working Group on Interventional Cardiology of the European Society of Cardiology,2025-05-05,10.4244/EIJ-D-24-01043,https://doi.org/10.4244/EIJ-D-24-01043,PMC12038363,Paid,Thrombus characterisation and evolution of hypoattenuating leaflet thickening after transcatheter aortic valve implantation GRODECKI 2025,Not downloaded,"['aortic valve implantation', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'hypoattenuating leaflet thickening', 'Quantifying hypoattenuating leaflet', 'HALT', 'transcatheter aortic', 'valve implantation', 'aortic valve', 'hypoattenuating leaflet', 'leaflet thickening']",2025-05-12,Pending,[]
40323430,Mutational landscape and impact of clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential in severe aortic valve stenosis.,"BACKGROUND: Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) has been progressively established as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and associated with worsened outcomes in patients with aortic valve stenosis (AVS). This cohort study aimed to evaluate the mutational landscape of CHIP and its' influence on clinical outcomes.
METHODS: 194 patients with AVS undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) were sequenced using a capture panel for multiple CH driver mutations and follow up conducted for three years.
RESULTS: We found high prevalences (77.8%) of a broad spectrum of CH-driver mutations across 38 genes, with 34% of patients fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for CHIP. Evaluating the impact of CHIP driver mutations on outcomes, the presence of CHIP was associated with mortality only when adjusting for confounding factors (HR: 2.143, 95% CI: 1.029-4.461, p = 0.042), while the presence of CH driver mutations at low VAF showed no association with mortality (p = 0.377). However, when excluding DNMT3A-CHIP, we found a significant association of CHIP with mortality in univariate (p = 0.022) and multivariable (HR: 2.976, 95% CI: 1.381-6.411, p = 0.005) analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: As the first study to evaluate a broad spectrum of CH driver mutations at all variant allele frequencies in the context of aortic valve stenosis, we found CHIP to be a frequent phenomenon and CH-driver mutations to be highly prevalent in patients with severe AVS. CHIP, other than DNMT3A-CHIP, was associated with increased mortality even after successful TAVR. The presence of CH driver mutations at low allele frequencies was not associated with mortality.","['Raúl Nicolas Jamin', 'Baravan Al-Kassou', 'Theresa Kleuker', 'Jasmin Shamekhi', 'Benedikt Bartsch', 'Ansgar Ackerschott', 'Muntadher Al Zaidi', 'Hannah Billig', 'Claus Moritz Graef', 'Malte Kelm', 'Stephan Baldus', 'Georg Nickenig', 'Eicke Latz', 'Sebastian Zimmer']",Clinical research in cardiology : official journal of the German Cardiac Society,2025-05-05,10.1007/s00392-025-02658-9,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00392-025-02658-9,PMC8874362,Free,Mutational landscape and impact of clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential in severe aortic valve stenosis JAMIN 2025,pdfs\Mutational landscape and impact of clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential in severe aortic valve stenosis JAMIN 2025.pdf,"['aortic valve stenosis', 'Medicare', 'CHIP', 'clonal hematopoiesis', 'aortic valve', 'driver mutations', 'CHIP driver mutations', 'patients', 'valve stenosis', 'MDS']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Aortic valve stenosis', 'Clonal hematopoiesis', 'Transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"

40320003,Machine Learning Methods to Predicting Transvalvular Gradient Waveform Post-Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Using Pre-procedural Echocardiogram.,"OBJECTIVE: Time-varying transvalvular pressure gradient after transcatheter aortic valve replacement indicates the effectiveness of the therapy. The objective was to develop a novel machine learning method enhanced by generative artificial intelligence and smart data selection strategies to predict the post-transcatheter aortic valve replacement gradient waveform using pre-procedural Doppler echocardiogram.
METHODS: A total of 110 patients undergoing TAVR (mean age 78.2 ± 9.0 years, 52.5% female) were included for pressure gradient collection. A deep machine learning model was trained and tested to predict post-procedural pressure gradient waveform from pre-procedural pressure gradient waveform based on the proposed generative active learning framework.
RESULTS: The trained model demonstrated an average prediction accuracy of 84.85% across the 10 test patients measured from the relative mean absolute error between the predicted gradient waveform and ground truth. The generative method improved prediction accuracy by 3.11%, while the data selection strategy increased it by 16.03% compared to the baseline experimental group using plain machine learning. Additionally, Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated a strong agreement between the proposed method and clinical measurements for both mean and peak pressure gradient predictions.
CONCLUSIONS: A deep, generative, active machine learning model was developed to output the prediction of post-TAVR time-varying pressure gradient from the pre-procedural time-varying gradient obtained from Doppler echocardiogram. Such a predictive method may help guide decision-making for the prevention of various post-TAVR complications.

40319622,Perioperative management and outcomes of surgical pulmonary valve replacement following tetralogy of fallot repair: A retrospective study.,"BACKGROUND: While the long-term prognosis of Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) repair is favourable, the frequency of interventions for pulmonary valve insufficiency during follow-up remains high, raising concerns regarding its invasiveness. This study aimed to evaluate the safety measures and strategies for the perioperative management of pulmonary valve interventions following TOF repair.
METHODS: From November 2022 to December 2023, interventions in the pulmonary artery for TOF were performed in 17 patients; a retrospective analysis was conducted on all patients. Preoperative haemodynamic evaluation was performed using 4D-flow magnetic resonance imaging in all cases.
RESULTS: The 17 patients included in the study had a mean age of 24.1 ± 14 years. The mean duration from repair to re-intervention was 18.2 ± 12 years, with a preoperative right ventricular ejection fraction of 42.3 ± 12 %. The mean surgical time, cardiopulmonary bypass time, and aortic cross-clamp time were 389 ± 96, 210 ± 67, and 106 ± 48 min, respectively. Pulmonary valve replacement was performed in eight patients, with seven using porcine aortic valves and one using a bovine pericardial valve. The Rastelli-type procedure was performed in nine cases, with seven using expanded polytetrafluoroethylene valved conduits and two using composite grafts of a porcine bioprosthetic valve and Valsalva graft. Additional procedures included right ventricular outflow tract myectomy in nine patients, pulmonary artery reconstruction in five, cryoablation in four, coronary artery bypass grafting in three, tricuspid valve repair in three, and ventricular septal defect closure in one. There were no cases of early mortality, stroke, or re-operation within 30 days.
CONCLUSION: Interventions on the pulmonary valves following TOF repair can be safely performed with appropriate perioperative management. The primary goal of surgical pulmonary valve replacement is to preserve the right ventricular function and reconstruct a smooth pathway from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery, considering future transcatheter interventions. Further long-term follow-up is necessary to assess outcomes, such as remote mortality, right ventricular function, and arrhythmia occurrence.","['Chiaki Aichi', 'Keiichi Itatani', 'Yosuke Nakai', 'Takumi Kawase', 'Jiryo Haibara', 'Satoki Ozoe', 'Hisao Suda']",International journal of surgery case reports,2025-05-03,10.1016/j.ijscr.2025.111406,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2025.111406,,Paid,Perioperative management and outcomes of surgical pulmonary valve replacement following tetralogy of fallot repair A retrospective study AICHI 2025,Not available,"['tetralogy of fallot', 'pulmonary valve', 'pulmonary', 'pulmonary valve replacement', 'TOF', 'TOF repair', 'valve', 'surgical pulmonary valve', 'Perioperative management', 'pulmonary artery']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['4D-flow magnetic resonance imaging', 'Pulmonary valve replacement', 'Tetralogy of Fallot']"
40317314,Impact of an improvement in the early left ventricular ejection fraction on the 1-year clinical outcomes and its predictors after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.,"PURPOSE: We evaluated the 1-year clinical outcomes (all-cause mortality, heart failure rehospitalization, and their composite) in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) and a preoperative left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 50% who underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), and examined the baseline factors predicting ≥ 10% early LVEF improvement.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 44 patients who underwent TAVR and divided them into Group R (≥ 10% LVEF improvement, n = 25) or Group N (< 10% improvement, n = 19). A Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to assess the survival rates, and multivariable logistic regression was applied to identify the predictors of LVEF improvement.
RESULTS: The mean patient age was 84.8 ± 4.8 years, and 40.9% were male. Post-TAVR, 56.8% of patients showed ≥ 10% LVEF improvement (mean increase: 16.7 ± 6.1%). The one-year mortality was similar between the groups (p = 0.383), whereas the composite endpoint tended to be higher in Group N (0.4% vs. 21.1%, p = 0.072). The peak aortic valve velocity was the only significant predictor (OR = 0.255, p = 0.048; cutoff: 4.45 m/s, sensitivity, 0.840; specificity, 0.684).

40310672,Multimodal Visualization and Explainable Machine Learning-Driven Markers Enable Early Identification and Prognosis Prediction for Symptomatic Aortic Stenosis and Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: Multicenter Cohort Study.,"BACKGROUND: Currently, there is a paucity of literature addressing personalized risk stratification using multimodal data in patients with symptomatic aortic stenosis and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to enhance the performance of risk assessment models in this patient population by developing a predictive model for adverse outcomes using various machine learning (ML) techniques.
METHODS: This multicenter cohort study included 326 patients diagnosed with severe AS and HFpEF who underwent TAVR between January 2017 and December 2023. Patients were allocated to training (n=195) and independent validation (n=131) sets based on hospital affiliation. A dual-phase feature selection process, combining least absolute shrinkage and selection operator logistic regression and the Boruta algorithm, was used to identify relevant variables from the multimodal dataset. A total of 5 ML model-decision trees, K-nearest neighbors, random forest, support vector machine, and extreme gradient boosting were used to construct a visualization and explainable predictive framework to elucidate model decision-making processes.
RESULTS: The primary features identified included age, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, fasting blood glucose, triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio, triglyceride glucose index, triglyceride glucose-BMI index, atherogenic index of plasma index, and Apolipoprotein B. Among the 5 models, the support vector machine demonstrated the best predictive performance for major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events in patients with severe AS and HFpEF following TAVR, achieving an area under the curve of 0.756 (95% CI 0.631-0.881) in the independent validation set. The model exhibited good calibration and robust predictive power in both training and validation sets and demonstrated the highest net benefit in decision curve analysis compared to other models. To extract significant variables influencing the algorithm and ensure model appropriateness, we interpreted cohort and personalized model predictions using Shapley Additive Explanations values.
CONCLUSIONS: Our ML-based multimodal model, incorporating 8 readily accessible predictors, demonstrated robust predictive capability for 12 months of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events risk. This model can be used to identify high-risk individuals with AS and HFpEF following TAVR, potentially aiding in risk stratification and personalized treatment strategies.","['Jun Wang', 'Jiajun Zhu', 'Hui Li', 'Shili Wu', 'Siyang Li', 'Zhuoya Yao', 'Tongjian Zhu', 'Bi Tang', 'Shengxing Tang', 'Jinjun Liu']",Journal of medical Internet research,2025-05-01,10.2196/70587,https://doi.org/10.2196/70587,,Paid,Multimodal Visualization and Explainable Machine Learning Driven Markers Enable Early Identification and Prognosis Prediction for Symptomatic Aortic Stenosis and Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Multicenter Cohort Study WANG 2025,Not available,"['Markers Enable Early', 'Enable Early Identification', 'Learning-Driven Markers Enable', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Symptomatic Aortic Stenosis', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Preserved Ejection Fraction', 'Markers Enable', 'Enable Early', 'Early Identification']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['heart failure with preserved ejection fraction', 'interpretable models', 'machine learning', 'major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events.', 'symptomatic aortic stenosis', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"
40308627,Comparative effectiveness of transcatheter vs surgical aortic valve replacement: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: The management of severe symptomatic aortic stenosis has been revolutionized by transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), offering a minimally invasive alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). However, the comparative safety and efficacy of these interventions remain subjects of ongoing investigation.
AIM: To compare the clinical outcomes and safety of TAVR vs SAVR in patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis.
METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing TAVR and SAVR were identified from databases including PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science up to May 31, 2024. Data were extracted on clinical outcomes, including mortality, procedural complications, and post-procedure adverse events. Risk ratios (RRs) with 95%CIs were calculated using a random-effects model.
RESULTS: A total of 10 RCTs were included. TAVR demonstrated a significantly lower risk of acute kidney injury (RR: 0.33; 95%CI: 0.25-0.44), major bleeding (RR: 0.37; 95%CI: 0.30-0.46), and new-onset atrial fibrillation (RR: 0.44; 95%CI: 0.34-0.57) compared to SAVR. However, TAVR was associated with higher risks of new permanent pacemaker implantation (RR: 3.49; 95%CI: 2.77-4.39), major vascular complications (RR: 2.47; 95%CI: 1.91-3.21), and paravalvular leaks (RR: 4.15; 95%CI: 3.14-5.48). Mortality at 30 days was comparable (RR: 0.95; 95%CI: 0.78-1.15), but long-term mortality was slightly higher with TAVR in some analyses (RR: 1.23; 95%CI: 1.01-1.49). Rates of stroke (RR: 0.97; 95%CI: 0.81-1.17) and myocardial infarction (RR: 0.91; 95%CI: 0.67-1.24) were similar between the groups.
CONCLUSION: TAVR offers a less invasive option with significant benefits in reducing acute kidney injury, major bleeding, and new-onset atrial fibrillation, making it particularly advantageous for high-risk surgical candidates. However, higher risks of permanent pacemaker implantation, vascular complications, and paravalvular leaks highlight the need for individualized patient selection and shared decision-making to optimize outcomes.","['Iman Moradi', 'Muhammad Saqlain Mustafa', 'Jannat Sardar Sheikh', 'Behrooz Shojai Rahnama', 'Matthew Fredericks', 'Anil Kumar Yennam', 'Mustafa Arain', 'Utsow Saha', 'Andrew Richard Ma', 'Adithya Nagendran', 'Moosa Bin Omer', 'Muhammad Armaghan', 'Diana Carolina Cortés Jaimes', 'Nagavenkata Lova Surya Vamsi Avinash Bojanki', 'Muhammad Ashir Shafique']",World journal of cardiology,2025-04-26,10.4330/wjc.v17.i4.104168,https://doi.org/10.4330/wjc.v17.i4.104168,PMC12038701,Free,Comparative effectiveness of transcatheter vs surgical aortic valve replacement A systematic review and meta analysis MORADI 2025,pdfs\Comparative effectiveness of transcatheter vs surgical aortic valve replacement A systematic review and meta analysis MORADI 2025.pdf,"['aortic valve replacement', 'Department of Medicine', 'surgical aortic valve', 'aortic valve', 'TAVR', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'aortic', 'valve replacement', 'surgical aortic', 'Muhammad Saqlain Mustafa']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Aortic stenosis', 'Meta-analysis', 'Surgical aortic valve replacement', 'Transcatheter aortic valve replacement', 'Treatment decision-making']"
40308620,Sutureless aortic valve and post-operative atrial fibrillation: Five-year outcomes from a propensity matched cohort study.,"BACKGROUND: The Perceval Sorin S (perceval valve) is a sutureless bioprosthetic designed for use in a high-risk cohort who may not be suitable for transcatheter aortic valve implantation or a conventional surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR).
AIM: To compare five-year post-operative outcomes in a cohort undergoing isolated AVR with the perceval valve to a contemporary cohort undergoing surgical AVR with a sutured bioprosthesis.
METHODS: This study was a retrospective, cohort study at a single tertiary unit. Between 2017 and 2023, 982 suitable patients were identified. 174 Perceval valve replacements were matched to 174 sutured valve replacements. Cohort characteristics, intra-operative details, and post-operative outcomes were compared between the two groups.
RESULTS: Time under the aortic cross-clamp (P < 0.001), time on the cardiopulmonary bypass (P < 0.001) and total operative time (P < 0.001) were significantly reduced in the Perceval group. Patients in the Perceval valve group were at a lower risk of postoperative pneumonia [odds ratio (OR) = 0.53 (0.29-0.94)] and atrial fibrillation [OR = 0.58 (0.36-0.93)]. After propensity-matching, all-cause mortality did not significantly differ between the two groups in the five-year follow-up period. Larger valve sizes conferred an increased risk of mortality (P = 0.020).
CONCLUSION: Sutureless surgical AVR (SAVR) is a safe and efficient alternative to SAVR with a sutured bioprosthesis, and may confer a reduced risk of post-operative atrial fibrillation. Clinician tendency towards 'oversizing' sutureless aortic valves translates into adverse clinical outcomes. Less time on the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit allows for the treatment of otherwise high-risk patients.","['Thomas French', 'Sanjeet Singh Avtaar Singh', 'Vincenzo Giordano', 'Charilaos-Panagiotis Koutsogiannidis', 'Kelvin Hao Han Lim', 'Renzo Pessotto', 'Vipin Zamvar']",World journal of cardiology,2025-04-26,10.4330/wjc.v17.i4.102669,https://doi.org/10.4330/wjc.v17.i4.102669,PMC12038705,Free,Sutureless aortic valve and post operative atrial fibrillation Five year outcomes from a propensity matched cohort study FRENCH 2025,pdfs\Sutureless aortic valve and post operative atrial fibrillation Five year outcomes from a propensity matched cohort study FRENCH 2025.pdf,"['aortic valve', 'Singh Avtaar Singh', 'valve', 'AVR', 'Sutureless aortic valve', 'perceval valve', 'aortic', 'Sanjeet Singh Avtaar', 'Sutureless aortic', 'transcatheter aortic valve']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Aortic valve replacements', 'Atrial fibrillation', 'Survival', 'Sutureless valves']"
40306844,Clinical Impact of Midframe Underexpansion Following TAVR Using a Self-Expanding Transcatheter Heart Valve.,"BACKGROUND: The occurrence and clinical impact of transcatheter heart valve midframe underexpansion following transcatheter aortic valve replacement are not well understood.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate midframe underexpansion among patients treated with the self-expanding ACURATE neo2 device.
METHODS: This retrospective analysis included 604 patients (median age 82 years; Q1-Q3: 78-85 years; 61.4% women) from 2 European high-volume centers. Midframe underexpansion was assessed on postimplantation fluoroscopic images and defined as nonparallelism of commissure posts. The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause mortality, stroke, or rehospitalization at 1 year.
RESULTS: Midframe underexpansion was identified in 13.9% of patients (84 of 604) and was associated with higher rates of the primary endpoint (33 of 84 [39.3%; 95% CI: 28.8%-50.5%] vs 54 of 520 [10.4%; 95% CI: 7.9%-13.3%]; P < 0.001) and each of its components. Furthermore, midframe underexpansion was independently associated with 1-year all-cause mortality (adjusted HR: 4.07; 95% CI: 2.26-7.33; P < 0.001). The only independent predictor of midframe underexpansion was the absence of postdilatation (adjusted OR: 5.76; 95% CI: 2.60-12.77; P < 0.001). Postdilatation significantly decreased the rate and extent of midframe underexpansion.
CONCLUSIONS: In this European cohort of ACURATE neo2 recipients, midframe underexpansion occurred in a minor proportion and was associated with poorer clinical outcomes through 1 year. Postdilatation effectively reduced the rate and extent of midframe underexpansion.","['Won-Keun Kim', 'Ole de Backer', 'Matthias Renker', 'Efstratios I Charitos', 'Chris Frawley', 'Yusuke Kobari', 'Mohamed Abdel-Wahab', 'Ahmed Abdelhafez', 'Niklas Lankisch', 'Darren Mylotte', 'Osama Soliman', 'Michael Joner', 'Helge Möllmann', 'Yeong-Hoon Choi', 'Samuel Sossalla']",JACC.

A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted. PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Web of Science databases were searched for relevant articles up to April 10th, 2024. Studies that reported comparisons of clinical outcomes between PCI before/concomitant with TAVI (PCI-TAVI) vs. TAVI alone, or comparisons between PCI before/concomitant with TAVI vs. PCI after TAVI (TAVI-PCI) were selected. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality in the short-term, mid-term and long-term follow-up. A total of 23 studies pooling 15812 patients were included. Compared to TAVI alone, PCI-TAVI showed no significant difference in all-cause mortality at short- and mid-term (RRshort-term = 1.10 95%CI 0.88-1.38; RRmid-term = 1.12 95%CI 0.97-1.30), but an increase during long-term follow-up (RRlong-term = 1.20 95%CI 1.06-1.36). Compared with PCI-TAVI, TAVI-PCI is associated with lower rate of all-cause mortality at both short- and long-term follow-ups. PCI before or concomitant with TAVI may not offer clinical benefits and could potentially lead to worse outcomes in the long term. Conversely, PCI after TAVI is associated with improved clinical outcomes in both the short and long term.","['Dayang Wang', 'Sijia Lai', 'Zichen Wang', 'Changbo Xuan', 'Xiaoxia Ren', 'Wenhua Peng', 'Guozhong Pan']",PloS one,2025-05-12,10.1371/journal.pone.0321395,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0321395,PMC12043176,Free,Impact of PCI strategies on outcomes of patients undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation with concomitant coronary artery disease A systematic review and meta analysis WANG 2025,pdfs\Impact of PCI strategies on outcomes of patients undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation with concomitant coronary artery disease.pdf,"['PCI', 'Aortic Valve Implantation', 'TAVI', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'undergoing Transcatheter Aortic', 'Aortic Valve', 'Valve Implantation', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'coronary artery disease', 'patients undergoing Transcatheter']",2025-05-12,Pending,[]
40305236,Management of difficult coronary anatomy during transcatheter aortic valve implantation: what are the key issues?,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Predicting and preventing coronary obstruction in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is crucial due to its high mortality risk.
RECENT FINDINGS: In native TAVR, predicting coronary obstruction requires assessing aortic cusp height, coronary artery height, valve-to-coronary distance, and leaflet calcium volume. The VIVID classification has been proposed for evaluating the risk of coronary obstruction in TAVR for failed bioprosthetic surgical valves. After TAVR with the Sapien 3 valve, the feasibility of redo TAVR and coronary access decreases with a shallower implantation of the initial Sapien 3. In redo TAVR of Sapien 3 within an Evolut valve, positioning the Sapien 3 outflow at node 4 improves redo TAVR feasibility and coronary accessibility compared to positioning at nodes 5 or 6. For valve sizing in redo TAVR with Sapien 3, in-vivo CT sizing results in smaller valve sizes than bench sizing, reducing coronary risk and improving redo TAVR feasibility. Leaflet modification and coronary stenting techniques and a dedicated leaflet-splitting device have been proposed to maintain coronary perfusion in high-risk cases.
SUMMARY: Coronary preservation in high-risk TAVR remains a significant challenge, requiring further research into preprocedural planning and leaflet modification strategies.","['Takayuki Onishi', 'Gilbert H L Tang']",Current opinion in cardiology,2025-04-25,10.1097/HCO.0000000000001229,https://doi.org/10.1097/HCO.0000000000001229,,Paid,Management of difficult coronary anatomy during transcatheter aortic valve implantation what are the key issues?

40301470,Risk factors and prognosis of silent cerebral infarction after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.,"The Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC)-3 definition of silent cerebral infarction among neurologic events after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) lacks clinical validation, yet its impact on postoperative in-hospital outcomes and long-term prognosis remains uncertain. This study aims to explore the perioperative related factors influencing the risk of SCI post-TAVR as defined by VARC-3 criteria, so as to identify high-risk individuals early and assess the effect of SCI on patient outcomes and one-year mortality following TAVR. This was a single-center study including 613 patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing TAVR, with all data collected prospectively in a dedicated database.We compared clinical baseline data, preoperative imaging results, perioperative factors, and intraoperative variables between patients with and without SCI according to VARC-3. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify risk factors associated with SCI. Propensity score matching (PSM) at a 1:2 ratio was employed based on fundamental characteristics such as age, gender, BMI, and medical history to minimize potential confounding. Post-matching, we analyzed differences in postoperative in-hospital outcomes and other results between the two groups. Survival times were compared using the Kaplan-Meier method, and survival curves were plotted. The log-rank test assessed statistical differences between the survival curves. Furthermore, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were conducted to determine risk factors for one-year postoperative mortality. Out of 827 TAVR patients screened, 613 were included in the final analysis-471 in the SCI group and 142 in the non-SCI group-resulting in an incidence rate of 76.8% for SCI. The occurrence of post-induction hypotension was significantly higher in the SCI group compared to the non-SCI group (70.28% vs. 61.27%, P = 0.043). Multivariate logistic regression revealed that post-induction hypotension lasting less than 10 min (odds ratio [OR]: 1.73; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.13-3.26; P = 0.009), hypotension lasting more than 10 min (OR: 1.98; 95% CI: 1.18-3.33; P = 0.01), and postoperative tachyarrhythmia (OR: 1.98; 95% CI: 1.27-3.07; P = 0.002) were significant risk factors for developing SCI after TAVR. Following 1:2 PSM, 416 patients remained-274 in the SCI group and 142 in the non-SCI group. After matching, the SCI group had a notably higher incidence of postoperative delirium compared to the non-SCI group (9.12% vs. 2.82%; P = 0.017), and their one-year mortality rate was also elevated (5.47% vs. 0.70%; P = 0.016). Additionally, multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that elevated preoperative creatinine levels (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.01; 95% CI: 1.01-1.02; P = 0.011), presence of SCI (HR: 10.81; 95% CI: 1.31-89.18; P = 0.027), Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) score greater than 7% (HR: 3.32; 95% CI: 1.07-10.33; P < 0.038), age 75 years or older (HR: 7.86; 95% CI: 1.01-14.47; P = 0.049), and a history of stroke (HR: 7.20; 95% CI: 2.32-22.35; P < 0.001) were independent risk factors for one-year mortality post-TAVR. Our findings suggest that post-induction hypotension and postoperative tachyarrhythmia are significant risk factors for SCI following TAVR as defined by VARC-3 criteria. Patients who developed SCI after TAVR exhibited higher rates of postoperative delirium and increased one-year mortality compared to those without this complication. Furthermore, factors such as elevated preoperative creatinine levels, an STS score above 7%, age of 75 years or older, and a prior history of stroke were associated with higher one-year mortality rates after TAVR. Given the negative impact of occult SCI on clinical outcomes, every effort should be made to reduce the risk of neurological complications after TAVR.","['Shuguang Wu', 'Yi Liu', 'Tingting Ni', 'Tao Lv', 'Yuanyuan Yao', 'Min Yan']",Scientific reports,2025-04-29,10.1038/s41598-025-99173-8,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-99173-8,PMC12041380,Free,Risk factors and prognosis of silent cerebral infarction after transcatheter aortic valve replacement WU 2025,pdfs\Risk factors and prognosis of silent cerebral infarction after transcatheter aortic valve replacement WU 2025.pdf,"['SCI', 'TAVR', 'SCI group', 'Risk factors', 'SCI group compared', 'silent cerebral infarction', 'factors', 'Risk', 'Academic Research Consortium', 'transcatheter aortic valve']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Clinical outcomes', 'Mortality', 'Postoperative delirium', 'Risk factors', 'Silent cerebral infarction', 'Transcatheter aortic valve replacement', 'VARC-3']"
40298371,AI-based prediction of left bundle branch block risk post-TAVI using pre-implantation clinical parameters.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) has revolutionized the treatment of severe aortic stenosis. Although its clinical efficacy is well established, the development of new-onset left bundle branch block (LBBB) following TAVI remains a frequent and concerning complication. This study aims to develop pre-implantation predictive models for new-onset LBBB after TAVI using both conventional machine learning (ML) algorithms and Large Language Models (LLMs).
METHODS: Of the 1113 patients who underwent TAVI over a 15-year period, 469 were included after excluding those with preexisting LBBB, pacing rhythm, or missing relevant data. Pre-procedural clinical parameters - such as valve type, valve size, patient demographics, and comorbidities - were analyzed. The dataset was split into training and testing sets. Several ML algorithms were employed, and performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, and F1 score. Additionally, LLMs (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) were assessed using Few-Shot and Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting.
RESULTS: New-onset persistent LBBB occurred in 15.29% of patients. Among ML models, XGBoost performed best. GPT-4 with CoT prompting demonstrated superior predictive performance compared to both conventional ML and GPT-3.5.
CONCLUSIONS: The current study establishes a predictive model leveraging pre-implantation parameters to anticipate the occurrence of new-onset left bundle branch block (LBBB) post-Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI).
Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) is a less invasive procedure used to treat patients with severe narrowing of the aortic valve. While it has significantly improved patient outcomes, some individuals develop a new heart rhythm problem called left bundle branch block (LBBB) after the procedure. LBBB can affect the heart’s electrical system and, in some cases, lead to complications such as the need for a permanent pacemaker.This study aimed to predict which patients are most likely to develop LBBB before the TAVR procedure by using artificial intelligence (AI) models. We analyzed data from 469 patients and tested different machine learning techniques, including traditional AI models and large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4. Our results showed that XGBoost, a machine learning algorithm, was the most accurate in predicting LBBB risk, while GPT-4 performed well when prompted using a specific reasoning approach (Chain of Thought method).These findings suggest that AI models can help identify high-risk patients before the procedure, allowing doctors to make better treatment decisions. However, further studies with larger patient groups are needed to confirm the accuracy of these predictions and improve personalized care for TAVR patients.","['Cheilas Vasileios', 'Filandrianos Giorgos', 'Martinos Antonios', 'Kostopoulou Anna']",Future cardiology,2025-04-29,10.1080/14796678.2025.2498866,https://doi.org/10.1080/14796678.2025.2498866,,Paid,AI based prediction of left bundle branch block risk post TAVI using pre implantation clinical parameters VASILEIOS 2025,Not available,"['Aortic Valve Implantation', 'left bundle branch', 'LBBB', 'Aortic Valve', 'bundle branch block', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'TAVI', 'bundle branch', 'Valve', 'Valve Implantation']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['LLMs', 'Transcatheter aortic valve replacement', 'aortic stenosis', 'artificial intelligence', 'individualized risk assessment', 'left bundle branch block', 'pre implantation predictors']"
40297162,"Current hotspot and study trend of transcatheter aortic valve replacement, a bibliometric analysis from 2009 to 2023.","INTRODUCTION: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), alternatively termed transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), represents a seminal advancement in cardiovascular interventions by obviating the necessity for open-heart surgery traditionally associated with surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). This technique entails percutaneous delivery of a bioprosthetic valve. Despite the surfeit of literature on TAVR over the past fifteen years, a bibliometric analysis is conspicuously absent.
METHOD: A query executed on the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) on September 1, 2022, returned 8,359 articles and reviews pertinent to TAVR. Data interpretation leveraged Microsoft Excel, CiteSpace, and VOSviewer to illustrate trends and delineate focal points within the corpus of TAVR research.
RESULT: The analysis incorporated 8,359 articles and reviews on TAVR from January 1, 2009, to August 1, 2023. Publication volume expanded from 35 in 2009 to a pinnacle in 2020, reflecting a near thirty folds increase, with citations escalating from 56 in 2009 to 27,354 in 2021. The United States prevailed in scholarly output (Np = 3,015), citation frequency (Nc = 70,991, excluding self-citations), and academic impact (H-index = 120). Columbia University was distinguished by the highest number of publications (Np = 380), citations (Nc = 41,051), and H-index (84). Within the author community, Rodes-Cabau J was preeminent, with 260 publications and an equivalent citation index and H-index. Keywords such as ""balloon-expandable valve,"" ""coronary access,"" ""next-day discharge,"" ""conducti on disturbances,"" and ""coronary obstruction"" have surfaced as the lexicon of burgeoning research themes.

40295400,Experience with a Large-Bore Vascular Closure Device in Patients Undergoing a Percutaneous Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (EVAR): A Multicentre Study.,"PURPOSE: Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is the preferred treatment for infrarenal aortic aneurysms, offering lower perioperative morbidity and mortality compared to open surgery. Common femoral artery (CFA) access can be achieved percutaneously or through surgical cutdown, with a percutaneous approach gaining more and more popularity. The MANTA vascular closure device (VCD), a collagen plug-based device, has shown promising results in transcatheter aortic valve replacement, but data on its use in percutaneous EVAR (pEVAR), particularly in obese patients, remain limited.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective study included all patients who underwent pEVAR from October 2018 to December 2022 across three Dutch hospitals and in whom the MANTA VCD has been applied. Patient demographics, perioperative characteristics, and clinical outcomes were recorded. Subgroup analysis was performed based on body mass index (BMI), comparing outcomes in obese (BMI ≥ 30) and non-obese (BMI < 30) patients. Technical success and access site complications were primary and secondary outcomes, respectively.
RESULTS: A total of 549 patients (mean age 75.16 ± 7.09 years, 88.9% male) were included, with 140 classified as obese. The MANTA VCD was used in 1024 CFAs. Overall technical success, defined as vascular closure with patent CFA, without requiring immediate surgery, was 98%, with a 3.1% complication rate, primarily due to closure failure. In obese patients, technical success was 98.9%, with a 1.5% complication rate, showing comparable outcomes to non-obese patients.
CONCLUSION: The MANTA VCD is effective and safe for CFA closure in pEVAR, including in obese patients. Given rising obesity rates, the favorable outcomes in this population are encouraging and suggesting a broader applicability in large-bore percutaneous procedures.","['Jacob Michiels', 'Maxim Peeters', 'Martine Uittenbogaart', 'Rens Oosterveld', 'Lucas Bloo', 'Maarten Loos', 'Lee Bouwman', 'Roel Janssen', 'Jan-Willem Elshof', 'Ozan Yazar']",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,2025-04-28,10.1007/s00270-025-04040-8,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00270-025-04040-8,PMC9790995,Free,Experience with a Large Bore Vascular Closure Device in Patients Undergoing a Percutaneous Endovascular Aneurysm Repair EVAR A Multicentre Study MICHIELS 2025,pdfs\Experience with a Large Bore Vascular Closure Device in Patients Undergoing a Percutaneous Endovascular Aneurysm Repair EVAR A Multicentre S.pdf,"['Endovascular Aneurysm Repair', 'aortic valve', 'biCuspId aortic valve', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'Percutaneous Endovascular Aneurysm', 'aortic valve replacement', 'Endovascular Aneurysm', 'valve', 'THV', 'coronary']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['EVAR', 'Endovascular aneurysm repair', 'MANTA vascular closure device', 'Obesity', 'Percutaneous closure', 'Vascular surgery']"
40295134,"Evaluation of the efficacy of angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor in patients with aortic stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation: protocol for a randomised, open-label, controlled study.","INTRODUCTION: There are a substantial number of patients developing heart failure after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) for severe aortic stenosis (AS), even though AS has been successfully treated. The purpose of this randomised controlled trial was to determine whether the addition of an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), sacubitril/valsartan, is superior to conventional medications in lowering N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels in patients undergoing TAVI for AS.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study design is a prospective, single-centre, open-label, randomised, parallel-group, two-arm study, in which participants will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either conventional medications plus ARNI or conventional medications only. In the ARNI group, if a patient was on an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker before TAVI, it will be switched to ARNI 100 mg/day (50 mg two times per day) on the first postoperative day. If not, candesartan 4 mg/day will be started 1-2 days before TAVI, and switched to ARNI 100 mg/day on the first postoperative day. As the patient has tolerability to ARNI, dosage will be increased stepwise to 400 mg/day 2-4 weeks apart. ARNI will be continued until at least 6-month follow-up. In the control group, the patient will receive conventional medications. The primary endpoint is the serum NT-proBNP value at 6-month follow-up after TAVI. Each group includes 42 patients (84 total patients).
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval for this study has been obtained from the Chiba University Hospital Certified Clinical Research Review Board (CRB3180015). The study is ongoing. Findings from this study will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations.

40293726,Transcatheter aortic valve implantation versus surgery in low-risk patients: in-hospital and mid-term outcomes.,"OBJECTIVES: aim of our study is to compare post procedural outcomes and mid-term mortality of low-risk patients treated by transfemoral TAVI or surgical AVR for severe aortic stenosis.
METHODS: Data of consecutive patients undergoing AVR or TAVI from 09/2017 to 12/2021 were prospectively collected and retrospectively reviewed. Eligible patients were aged between 75 and 85 years with low-surgical risk and isolated severe aortic stenosis. Exclusion criteria were prior heart surgery, valve-in-valve procedure, and the need for concomitant procedures. The primary end-point was mid-term all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: 351 patients were enrolled. 243 underwent TAVI and 108 underwent AVR. Compared to AVR, TAVI patients were older (82 [78-83 ] vs 78 [77-80], p < 0.001), with higher incidence of advanced CKD (33.3% vs 15.7%, p < 0,001) and poor mobility (15.6% vs 5.6%, p = 0.008) and a higher Euroscore II (2.2 [1.72-2.98] vs 1.9 [1.31-2.46 ], p = 0.002). AVR patients had a higher incidence of post-procedural AKI (29.6% vs 4.5%, p < 0.001), while TAVI patients had a higher incidence of LBBB (23.9% vs 1.8%, p < 0.001) and at least mild to moderate PVL (4.5% vs 0%, p = 0.021). Mid- term mortality was higher among TAVI patients (HR 0.38 [95% CI 0.23-0.88], p = 0.020). In the matched cohort TAVI had a higher incidence of LBBB (11.5% vs 1.3%, p = 0.018) and permanent PM implantation (12.8% vs 5.1%, p = 0.041), while AVR patients had a higher incidence of post-procedural AKI (33.3% vs 5.1%, p < 0.001). Mid-term mortality was higher in TAVI patients (HR 0.36 [95% CI 0.21-0.87], p = 0.019).

40289515,Vascular Closure Devices for Large Bore Femoral Access After Transfemoral Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: A Network Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Large-bore femoral access is commonly required in transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TF-TAVR), but vascular access complications remain prevalent, impacting patient outcomes. Various vascular closure devices (VCDs) are used for hemostasis, including the suture-based Prostar XL, Perclose ProGlide, and ProStyle, and the plug-based MANTA device. However, comprehensive comparative evidence on these VCDs, particularly single Perclose strategies, is lacking.
METHODS: A systematic review and network meta-analysis were conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. We included randomized and observational studies comparing the safety and efficacy of VCDs for large-bore femoral access closure in TF-TAVR patients. Primary outcomes included major vascular complications; secondary outcomes included major and minor bleeding, minor vascular complications, VCD failure, and all-cause mortality. Frequentist and Bayesian analyses were performed using a random-effects model, with additional subgroup analyses of single Perclose strategies.
RESULTS: Thirty-five studies comprising 16,503 patients met inclusion criteria. The single Perclose strategy, with or without adjunct Angio-Seal or FemoSeal, significantly reduced major vascular complications compared to dual Perclose (RR: 1.9, 95% CI [1.2-3.01]), MANTA (RR: 1.89, 95% CI [1.03-3.48]), and Prostar XL (RR: 3.46, 95% CI [1.94-6.18]). Among secondary outcomes, single Perclose also ranked highest in reducing minor complications and bleeding.
CONCLUSION: Single Perclose strategies, especially when combined with Angio-Seal, demonstrated superior safety and efficacy for large-bore femoral access closure following TF-TAVR. These findings support the need for further randomized trials to validate single Perclose as a primary approach in TF-TAVR vascular closure.","['Sunil Upadhaya', 'Alina Upreti', 'Kunal Gupta', 'Bella Gonzalez-Perez', 'Radia Ksayer', 'Pedro Cox-Alomar', 'Cristina Sanina', 'Anand Irimpen', 'Serdar Farhan', 'Jose Wiley']",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,2025-04-27,10.1002/ccd.31565,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.31565,,Paid,Vascular Closure Devices for Large Bore Femoral Access After Transfemoral Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement A Network Meta Analysis UPADHAYA 2025,Not available,"['Large Bore Femoral', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Transfemoral Transcatheter Aortic', 'Large Bore', 'Bore Femoral Access', 'Valve Replacement', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'Aortic Valve', 'Transfemoral Transcatheter']",2025-05-12,Pending,[]
40289335,Feasibility of standby ECMO with preset femoral vascular sheaths for high-risk transcatheter aortic valve replacement.,"ObjectiveVeno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) can provide temporary circulatory and respiratory support allowing hemodynamic stabilization during high-risk transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). However, the optimal timing of VA-ECMO use in high-risk TAVR remains controversial. We aimed to report our experience using a novel standby ECMO strategy during high-risk TAVR.MethodsWe retrospectively evaluated consecutive patients who received high-risk TAVR with standby ECMO between March 1,2023 and March 1,2024 at the Beijing Anzhen Hospital. Small, 5F or 6F sheaths were placed in ipsilateral femoral vein and artery before TAVR procedures. The primary outcome of this study was survival to hospital discharge with good neurological recovery defined as cerebral performance category (CPC) 1-2.ResultsA total of 24 patients undergoing high-risk TAVR with standby ECMO were included. Six (25.0%) of the 24 patients with standby ECMO suffered from cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest and required emergency VA-ECMO institution. The median (IQR) cannulation time was 8 (6-11) minutes, and the median (IQR) ECMO duration was 35 (24-48) hours. All of the 24 patients underwent successful TAVR procedures and survival to hospital discharge with CPC1-2.ConclusionsStandby ECMO with preset femoral vascular sheaths was feasible and effective for refractory cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest during high-risk TAVR.","['Liangshan Wang', 'Yan Wang', 'Hongfu Fu', 'Xin Meng', 'Chenglong Li', 'Chunjing Jiang', 'Dong Guo', 'Bo Xu', 'Pengcheng Wang', 'Yu Li', 'Ming Jia', 'Hong Wang', 'Zhongtao Du']",Perfusion,2025-05-12,10.1177/02676591241263285,https://doi.org/10.1177/02676591241263285,,Paid,Feasibility of standby ECMO with preset femoral vascular sheaths for high risk transcatheter aortic valve replacement WANG 2025,Not available,"['aortic valve replacement', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'high-risk transcatheter aortic', 'standby ECMO', 'high-risk TAVR', 'valve replacement', 'TAVR', 'ECMO', 'transcatheter aortic', 'aortic valve']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['femoral vascular sheath', 'high-risk', 'standby extracorporeal membrane oxygenation', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation']"
40288578,Comparative Effectiveness and Safety of Self-Expanding Versus Balloon-Expandable Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a safe alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement for patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis at increased surgical risk. However, comparative data on self-expanding valves (SEV) versus balloon-expanding valves (BEV) remain limited.
METHODS: A comprehensive review of PubMed and Embase was conducted through April 2024, identifying eight studies (five randomized controlled trials and three propensity-matched observational studies) comparing SEV and BEV in TAVR. Primary outcomes included all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and device success per Valve Academic Research Consortium criteria, while secondary outcomes assessed bioprosthetic valve dysfunction and adverse events (annulus rupture/dissection, coronary artery occlusion, valve dislocation/embolization, valve thrombosis, moderate and severe paravalvular aortic regurgitation, endocarditis, permanent pacemaker implantation, major or life-threatening bleeding, acute kidney injury, and stroke).
RESULTS: The analysis included 4,032 patients (SEV = 2,006; BEV = 2,017). SEV was associated with higher rates of moderate-to-severe paravalvular aortic regurgitation [OR, 1.76; CI 1.13-2.74; P = 0.01] and permanent pacemaker placement [OR, 1.57; CI, 1.23-2.00; P = 0.0002] compared to BEV. No significant differences were observed in 30-day or 1-year all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, device success, bioprosthetic valve dysfunction, valve dislocation/embolization, valve thrombosis, endocarditis, major or life-threatening bleeding, coronary artery occlusion, stroke, rehospitalization, or acute kidney injury.
CONCLUSION: SEV and BEV demonstrated comparable outcomes in mortality and device success. However, the higher risk of moderate-to-severe paravalvular aortic regurgitation and permanent pacemaker placement with SEV should be considered when selecting the optimal TAVR valve for individual patients.","['Montaser Elkholy', 'Mohammad Akkawi', 'George G Kidess', 'Zaid Abdulelah', 'Abdallah Rayyan', 'Mohammad Riyad Al-Dqour', 'Ahmad Damlakhy', 'Yasemin Bahar', 'M Chadi Alraies']",The American journal of the medical sciences,2025-04-25,10.1016/j.amjms.2025.04.010,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjms.2025.04.010,,Paid,Comparative Effectiveness and Safety of Self Expanding Versus Balloon Expandable Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement A Systematic Review and Meta Analysis ELKHOLY 2025,Not available,"['Effectiveness and Safety', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Versus Balloon-Expandable Transcatheter', 'Balloon-Expandable Transcatheter Aortic', 'Valve Replacement', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'Systematic Review', 'Comparative Effectiveness', 'Valve']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Self-expanding valves', 'balloon-expanding valves', 'effectiveness', 'safety']"
40287133,"Temporal Trends in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Outcomes in Patients With Low-Flow, Low-Gradient Aortic Stenosis: Insights From the TOPAS-TAVI Registry.","BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) technology and techniques have continuously improved, but data on their impact in low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis (LFLG-AS) remain limited. In particular, scarce data exist comparing the results of TAVR with new-generation devices vs early-generation devices in these patients. This study evaluated the temporal trends in TAVR practices among LFLG-AS patients.
METHODS: This multicentre registry included 424 consecutive LFLG-AS patients undergoing TAVR from 2007 to 2023, stratified by device generation: new-generation devices (n = 193) and early-generation devices (n = 231). All-cause mortality or heart failure hospitalisation (HFH) at 1-year follow-up was the primary end point.
RESULTS: The median Society of Thoracic Surgeons score was lower in the new-generation group (5.3% [interquartile range [IQR] 3.4%-8.2%] vs 7.4% [IQR 5.0%-12.1%]; P < 0.001), whereas left ventricular ejection fractions(LVEFs) were similar (new: 31.2 ± 8.3%; early: 30.0 ± 8.8%; P = 0.16). New-generation devices were associated with a significant reduction in moderate-to-severe paravalvular leak after TAVR (2.6% vs 9.1%; P = 0.005), but 30-day mortality was similar (new: 1.6%; early: 3.9%; P = 0.15). At 1 year, new-generation devices were associated with a greater LVEF improvement (43.8 ± 12.5% vs 39.8 ± 11.5%; P = 0.003), but without a significant reduction in all-cause mortality or HFH (new: 23.8%; early: 28.1%; P = 0.32). Chronic kidney disease and low hemoglobin independently predicted worse outcomes (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite procedural improvements with new-generation TAVR devices, clinical outcomes in LFLG-AS patients remain suboptimal. LVEF significantly improved after TAVR with new-generation devices but failed to translate into improved clinical outcomes. These findings suggest that TAVR alone may not suffice in this population and underscore the need for a comprehensive therapeutic approach that integrates TAVR with optimised medical management and cardiac rehabilitation.","['Siddhartha Mengi', 'Luis Nombela-Franco', 'Pedro Cepas-Guillén', 'Stamatios Lerakis', 'Raj Makkar', 'Tarun Chakravarty', 'Vassilis Babaliaros', 'Henrique Barbosa Ribeiro', 'Emilie Pelletier-Beaumont', 'Philippe Pibarot', 'Josep Rodés-Cabau']",The Canadian journal of cardiology,2025-04-24,10.1016/j.cjca.2025.04.015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2025.04.015,,Paid,Temporal Trends in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Outcomes in Patients With Low Flow Low Gradient Aortic Stenosis Insights From the TOPAS TAVI Registry MENGI 2025,Not available,"['Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Low-Gradient Aortic Stenosis', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'Aortic Stenosis', 'Aortic Valve', 'Valve Replacement', 'Low-Gradient Aortic', 'Valve Replacement Outcomes', 'TAVR']",2025-05-12,Pending,[]
40283668,Review Article: Contemporary Transcatheter Heart Valves for TAVI in Bicuspid Aortic Anatomy.,"Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most common congenital heart disease, affecting 0.5-2% of the population and often leading to early aortic valve degeneration. While surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) remains the gold standard for treating severe bicuspid aortic stenosis (AS), transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is emerging as a viable alternative in selected BAV anatomies. Initial experiences with first-generation transcatheter heart valves (THVs) showed the feasibility of this technique, but were associated with lower device success rates and higher complications, such as paravalvular leak (PVL) and pacemaker implantation. Advancements in second- and third- generation THVs, together with better pre-procedural imaging assessment and growing operator experience, have significantly enhanced TAVI outcomes in BAV patients, with results now comparable to those seen in tricuspid aortic valves (TAVs). Proper patient selection, pre-procedural sizing, and device implantation are key to improving TAVI success in BAV. Recent registry data on contemporary THV platforms demonstrate improved procedural success, hemodynamic performance, and the safety of TAVI in BAV. However, higher rates of PVL, pacemaker implantation, and strokes remain concerns. Ongoing advancements in THV design and procedural techniques will further enhance outcomes for this challenging population. Up to the present, there are no dedicated THVs for BAV, but the latest-generation THVs offer promising results.","['Chrysavgi Simopoulou', 'Omar Oliva', 'Vincenzo Cesario', 'Nicolas Dumonteil', 'Didier Tchetche', 'Chiara De Biase']",Journal of clinical medicine,2025-04-20,10.3390/jcm14082838,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm14082838,PMC12027816,Free,Review Article Contemporary Transcatheter Heart Valves for TAVI in Bicuspid Aortic Anatomy SIMOPOULOU 2025,pdfs\Review Article Contemporary Transcatheter Heart Valves for TAVI in Bicuspid Aortic Anatomy SIMOPOULOU 2025.pdf,"['aortic valve', 'BAV', 'TAVI', 'Bicuspid aortic valve', 'Transcatheter Heart Valves', 'Bicuspid Aortic', 'Aortic', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'aortic valve implantation', 'valve']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['balloon-expandable valve (BEV)', 'bicuspid aortic valve (BAV)', 'paravalvular leak (PVL)', 'permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI)', 'self-expanding valve (SEV)', 'transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI)']"

This case report highlights the diagnostic and therapeutic approach for a 72-year-old woman presenting with exertional chest pain, dyspnea, fatigue, and a history of melena. Methods: The diagnostic workup revealed severe microcytic anemia and a reduced vWF ristocetin-to-antigen ratio. Imaging confirmed severe degenerative aortic stenosis, while video capsule endoscopy identified angiodysplasia and telangiectasias in the small bowel as the source of gastrointestinal bleeding. Following evaluation by a multidisciplinary Heart Team, the patient underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with an Evolut Fx self-expanding prosthesis. Results: Post-procedural echocardiography showed mild paravalvular regurgitation. The patient's clinical course was favorable, with resolution of anemia and no further gastrointestinal bleeding episodes. Conclusions: Heyde syndrome requires a high index of suspicion for diagnosis in patients with severe aortic stenosis and unexplained anemia or gastrointestinal bleeding. TAVR offers an effective treatment option that not only resolves valvular pathology, but also mitigates associated bleeding risks.","['Claudiu Florin Rășinar', 'Alexandru Tîrziu', 'Rebeca Ionela Rășinar', 'Florin Gîru', 'Cristian Mornoș', 'Dan Gaiță', 'Constantin Tudor Luca', 'Daniel Miron Brie']",Journal of clinical medicine,2025-04-19,10.3390/jcm14082819,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm14082819,PMC12027620,Free,Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Reverses Heyde Syndrome A Case Report of Severe Aortic Stenosis and Gastrointestinal Bleeding RĂȘINAR 2025,pdfs\Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Reverses Heyde Syndrome A Case Report of Severe Aortic Stenosis and Gastrointestinal Bleeding RINAR 2.pdf,"['Severe Aortic Stenosis', 'Aortic Stenosis', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Gastrointestinal Bleeding', 'Aortic Valve', 'Aortic', 'Heyde Syndrome', 'Severe Aortic', 'Replacement Reverses Heyde']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Heyde syndrome', 'acquired von Willebrand syndrome', 'angiodysplasia', 'aortic stenosis', 'gastrointestinal bleeding', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR)', 'video capsule endoscopy (VCE)', 'von Willebrand factor (vWF)']"

When compared with TAVR, redo-TAVR is a rare and novel procedure. Current clinical data derived from registries suggest excellent safety, with low rates of 30-day and 1-year mortality following redo-TAVR. Proper understanding of data from bench studies regarding optimal valve configurations, of patient anatomy and of the technical properties of transcatheter heart valves (THV) is essential for patient selection and procedural success. Lifetime management of redo-TAVR should start before the index procedure, as the choice of the index THV has a major impact on the feasibility of redo-TAVR. Procedural optimization by adequate valve sizing, commissural alignment and adequate implant depth of both index and redo-THV are critical determinants of optimal hemodynamics for maximized valve longevity, as well as lifelong coronary access.","['Ruxandra I Sava', 'Philippe Garot', 'Hakim Benamer', 'Emmanuel Gall', 'Théo Pezel', 'Morad Djebbar', 'Neila Sayah', 'David Meier', 'Georgios Tzimas', 'Jérôme Garot', 'Florence Leclercq', 'Mariama Akodad']",Journal of clinical medicine,2025-04-17,10.3390/jcm14082770,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm14082770,PMC12027932,Free,Redo Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Procedural Optimization and Patient Selection From Bench to Clinical Practice SAVA 2025,pdfs\Redo Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Procedural Optimization and Patient Selection From Bench to Clinical Practice SAVA 2025.pdf,"['Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Valve', 'Valve Replacement Procedural', 'Valve Replacement', 'Aortic Valve', 'redo-TAVR', 'Patient Selection', 'bench studies', 'Redo-Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Patient']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['CT predictors', 'TAV-in-TAV', 'coronary access', 'coronary alignment']"
40283481,A Tale of Two Diseases: Decoding Aortic Stenosis and Cardiac Amyloidosis.,"Background/Objectives: Transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR-CA) is an infiltrative cardiomyopathy caused by transthyretin (TTR) amyloid deposition in the myocardium, increasingly recognized in patients with aortic stenosis (AS). This study aims to investigate the diagnostic challenges and therapeutic strategies for patients with both conditions, focusing on shared pathophysiological mechanisms and key diagnostic indicators. Methods: A multimodal diagnostic approach was applied, utilizing cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) and bone scintigraphy with technetium-99m-labeled tracers to assess AS patients with suspected ATTR-CA. Clinical signs, such as disproportionate heart failure symptoms, conduction abnormalities, and low-flow, low-gradient AS, were evaluated. Electrocardiographic findings, including low-voltage QRS complexes and pseudo-infarction patterns, were also assessed. Treatment options, including transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and emerging pharmacotherapies for ATTR-CA, were analyzed. Results: The study found that ATTR-CA is increasingly prevalent in AS patients, with shared mechanisms like oxidative stress and amyloid-induced tissue remodeling. Key diagnostic signs include disproportionate heart failure symptoms, conduction abnormalities, and specific electrocardiographic patterns. TAVR was effective in both isolated AS and AS with ATTR-CA, although patients with both conditions had a higher risk of heart failure hospitalization and persistent symptoms. Emerging pharmacotherapies, such as TTR stabilizers and gene-silencing agents, showed promise in slowing disease progression. Conclusions: A multimodal diagnostic approach is essential for the early detection of ATTR-CA in AS patients. Combining TAVR with emerging pharmacotherapies may improve long-term outcomes for this high-risk group, enhancing patient care in those with both conditions.","['Ioannis Gialamas', 'George E Zakynthinos', 'George Dimeas', 'Panteleimon Pantelidis', 'Elias Gialafos', 'Styliani Brili', 'Athina Goliopoulou', 'Ourania Katsarou', 'Elsi Tryfou', 'Konstantinos Kalogeras', 'Gerasimos Siasos', 'Evangelos Oikonomou']",Journal of clinical medicine,2025-04-12,10.3390/jcm14082652,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm14082652,PMC12027563,Free,A Tale of Two Diseases Decoding Aortic Stenosis and Cardiac Amyloidosis GIALAMAS 2025,pdfs\A Tale of Two Diseases Decoding Aortic Stenosis and Cardiac Amyloidosis GIALAMAS 2025.pdf,"['Aortic Stenosis', 'patients', 'Decoding Aortic Stenosis', 'ATTR-CA', 'Aortic', 'Cardiac Amyloidosis', 'Stenosis', 'TAVR', 'Amyloidosis', 'Cardiac']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['AS', 'ATTR', 'aortic stenosis', 'cardiac amyloidosis', 'cardiomyopathy', 'hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis', 'low-flow', 'low-gradient aortic stenosis', 'transthyretin', 'transthyretin amyloidosis', 'wild-type transthyretin amyloidosis']"
40270122,The Impact of Concomitant Mitral Regurgitation on Echocardiography Parameters After TransCatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Mitral regurgitation (MR) commonly coexists with aortic stenosis (AS) and is a potential risk factor influencing outcomes following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the mean changes in key echocardiographic parameters before and after TAVR and to compare these changes between patients with moderate-to-severe MR (MR ≥ 2) and those with none-to-mild MR (MR < 2).
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted using six electronic databases. We included studies that evaluated patients undergoing TAVR, classified them based on baseline MR grade ≥ 2 (moderate/severe MR) or MR grade < 2 (none/mild MR), and reported the mean difference (MD) in echocardiographic parameters before and after TAVR in both groups. The primary outcomes included changes in ejection fraction (EF), LV end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) index, LV end-systolic volume (LVESV) index, LV end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), LV end-systolic diameter (LVESD), aortic valve area (AVA), and the mean aortic gradient. Pooled MDs were analyzed using a random-effects model.
RESULTS: Thirteen studies with 7163 patients were included, of which 2376 had an MR ≥ 2. The MR < 2 and MR ≥ 2 groups experienced significant improvements in AVA and reductions in mean aortic gradient, LVEDV index, LVESV index, LVEDD, and LVESD. Compared to MR < 2 patients, those with MR ≥ 2 exhibited significantly greater improvements in EF (MD = 2.03; 95% CI: 0.81, 3.24), LVEDV index (MD = -5.55; 95% CI: -7.85, -3.26), LVESV index (MD = -5.43; 95% CI: -7.28, -3.58), LVESD (MD = -2.23; 95% CI: -3.71, -0.26), and mean aortic gradient (MD = 1.43; 95% CI: 0.79, 2.07). However, the changes in LVEDD and AVA were not significantly different between the groups.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that patients with moderate-to-severe baseline MR before TAVR showed greater pronounced improvements in specific echocardiographic parameters related to LV function and geometry, particularly in LVEF, LVEDV index, LVESV index, and LVESD, compared to those with none-to-mild MR. Future studies should focus on stratifying outcomes according to MR etiology and using advanced imaging techniques to delineate better the mechanisms underlying these improvements.","['Bahar Darouei', 'Reza Amani-Beni', 'Mehrdad Rabiee Rad', 'Ghazal Ghasempour Dabaghi', 'Reza Eshraghi', 'Ashkan Bahrami', 'Ehsan Amini-Salehi', 'Seyyed Mohammad Hashemi', 'Sadegh Mazaheri-Tehrani', 'Mohammad Reza Movahed']",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,2025-04-24,10.1002/ccd.31555,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.31555,,Paid,The Impact of Concomitant Mitral Regurgitation on Echocardiography Parameters After TransCatheter Aortic Valve Replacement A Systematic Review and Meta Analysis DAROUEI 2025,Not available,"['Concomitant Mitral Regurgitation', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Impact of Concomitant', 'Systematic Review', 'Concomitant Mitral', 'TransCatheter Aortic Valve', 'Mitral Regurgitation', 'Valve Replacement', 'Aortic Valve', 'Echocardiography Parameters']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['aortic valve stenosis', 'echocardiography', 'meta‐analysis', 'mitral valve insufficiency', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"

This systematic review examined the association between computed tomography (CT)-derived adipose tissue parameters and TAVI outcomes. We searched major databases for studies on visceral (VAT), subcutaneous (SAT), and intramuscular (IMAT) adipose tissue parameters and post-TAVI outcomes. Fourteen studies (9692 patients) were included. Higher SAT area/volume was consistently associated with better survival (5 studies, HR range: 0.83-2.77, p < 0.05). Lower SAT and VAT density also correlated with better survival (5 and 4 studies, respectively, HR range: 1.31-1.46, p < 0.05). VAT area showed mixed results. A VAT:SAT ratio < 1 was associated with better cardiovascular outcomes in one study. Lower IMAT index correlated with shorter hospital stays in a single study. This review reveals complex relationships between adipose tissue parameters and TAVI outcomes. Lower adipose tissue density and higher subcutaneous adiposity were most consistently associated with better outcomes. These findings suggest that detailed analysis of adipose tissue characteristics may enhance risk stratification in TAVI candidates.","['Matej Pekar', 'Piotr Branny', 'Otakar Jiravsky', 'Radim Spacek', 'Jan Alexander Mohr', 'Ivan Ranic', 'Bogna Jiravska Godula', 'Alica Cesnakova Konecna', 'Marek Kantor', 'Jan Hecko', 'Radek Neuwirth', 'Libor Sknouril', 'Jan Novak']",European journal of medical research,2025-04-24,10.1186/s40001-025-02587-3,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40001-025-02587-3,PMC12020199,Free,CT derived adipose tissue characteristics and TAVI all cause mortality and complications a systematic review PEKAR 2025,pdfs\CT derived adipose tissue characteristics and TAVI all cause mortality and complications a systematic review PEKAR 2025.pdf,"['adipose tissue', 'adipose tissue parameters', 'TAVI', 'tissue parameters', 'tissue', 'adipose', 'Czech Republic', 'adipose tissue characteristics', 'TAVI outcomes', 'CT-derived adipose tissue']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Adipose tissue parameters', 'CT-derived body composition', 'Risk stratification', 'Subcutaneous fat', 'TAVI outcomes', 'Visceral fat']"
40269711,Associations between new-onset postoperative atrial fibrillation and changes in left ventricular mass index in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement.,"BACKGROUND: New-onset postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) is common after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). At present, the impact of POAF on cardiac remodeling after TAVR has not been thoroughly studied.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the impact of POAF on cardiac remodeling and its association with clinical outcomes after TAVR.
METHODS: 601 patients undergoing TAVR for severe aortic stenosis were evaluated. Of these, 253 patients were identified to have POAF, which was categorized as normal left ventricular mass index (LVMI) in 54 (21%) and high LVMI in 199 (79%). The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause death, heart failure rehospitalization and disabling stroke. Reverse remodeling was assessed by transthoracic echocardiography.
RESULTS: In POAF patients, the 3-year cumulative incidence of primary composite outcome in the high LVMI subgroup was significantly higher than that in the normal LVMI subgroup (9.3 ± 3.3% vs. 13.5 ± 3.9%; p = 0.02). The incidence of LVMI regression after TAVR was lower in patients with POAF than in those without (65.6 ± 3.0% vs. 82.6 ± 2.7% at 3 years; p = 0.029). Furthermore, the 3-year cumulative incidence of the primary composite outcome and cardiovascular death was highest in the group of POAF without LVMI regression. Baseline LVMI (β = -1.73, p < 0.001) and POAF (β = -1.46, p < 0.001) were independent predictors of change in LVMI at one year.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with POAF had less LVMI regression and impaired cardiac reverse remodeling after TAVR, which increased the incidence of all-cause death and heart failure rehospitalization. Therefore, clinicians should be more proactive in monitoring and treating POAF after TAVR.","['Hua-Jie Zheng', 'Jun Li', 'Ling-Feng Tang', 'Mei Guo', 'Ya-Nan Wei', 'Wei Cheng']",BMC cardiovascular disorders,2025-04-23,10.1186/s12872-025-04763-z,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12872-025-04763-z,PMC12016421,Free,Associations between new onset postoperative atrial fibrillation and changes in left ventricular mass index in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement ZHENG 2025,pdfs\Associations between new onset postoperative atrial fibrillation and changes in left ventricular mass index in patients undergoing transcath.pdf,"['POAF', 'TAVR', 'LVMI', 'patients', 'patients undergoing TAVR', 'high LVMI', 'LVMI regression', 'aortic valve replacement', 'POAF patients', 'POAF group']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Aortic stenosis', 'Cardiac reverse remodeling', 'Postoperative atrial fibrillation', 'Transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"
40269687,Computed tomography-based coronary lumen volume to myocardial mass ratio in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a novel method for risk assessment.,"BACKGROUND: The coronary lumen volume to myocardial mass (V/M) ratio has been suggested as a quantitative metric of potential imbalance between coronary blood supply and myocardial oxygen demand. This study was designed to assess the prognostic value of the V/M ratio for predicting major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
METHODS: This study enrolled patients who received a standard planning computed tomography (CT) scan before TAVR and dichotomized at the median of 33.31 mm³/g of V/M ratio into groups with low V/M ratio and high V/M ratio. The V/M ratio was calculated by coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA). The endpoint was a composite of all-cause mortality, stroke, and hospitalization for heart failure. The cumulative incidence of the MACE was compared using Kaplan-Meyer plots and uni- and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis.
RESULTS: In total, 139 patients were enrolled in this study finally (mean age 71.7 ± 6.7 years, 41.7% female). The mean V/M ratio was considerably lower in patients with MACE than in those without MACE (26.5 ± 4.9mm3/g vs. 34.0 ± 3.8mm3/g, P<0.001). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression showed that the low V/M ratio group (≤ 33.31 mm³/g) had a higher risk of MACE after TAVR (HR: 6.14, 95%CI: 1.37-27.54; P = 0.018).
CONCLUSIONS: The lower V/M ratio could serve as an independent predictor of MACE in patients undergoing TAVR.

Considering that in aortic stenosis outcomes are governed by both valve degeneration and myocardial adverse remodeling, we aimed to evaluate machine-learning leveraging pre-procedural computed tomography (CT) for the prediction of 1-year mortality following TAVR. The analysis included data of consecutive patients who underwent TAVR at a high-volume center between January 2017 and January 2022 and was externally validated on unseen data from 3 international sites. Machine learning by extreme gradient boosting was trained and tested using clinical variables, CT-derived volumetric measurements including myocardial mass, and quantitative fibrocalcific aortic valve characteristics measured using standardized software. The EuroScore II and a separate machine learning risk score based exclusively on baseline clinical characteristics served as comparators. The derivation cohort included 631 consecutive patients (48 % men, 80 ± 8 years old, EuroSCORE II 6.5 [4.6-10.3] %). Machine learning was externally validated on data of 596 patients (48 % men, 81 ± 8 years old, EuroSCORE II 5.4 [4.7-8.1] %). In external validation, the machine learning prognostic risk score had an area under the receiver operator curve of 0.79 (0.74-0.84) which was superior to the EuroSCORE 0.59 (0.53-0.66), and the machine learning risk based on clinical data alone 0.64 (0.59-0.69), p < 0.001 for difference. Machine-learning integrating clinical data and CT-derived imaging characteristics was found to predict 1-year all-cause mortality following TAVR significantly better than clinical variables or clinical risk scores alone; and can help identify patients at higher prognostic risk prior to the procedure.","['Jacek Kwiecinski', 'Kajetan Grodecki', 'Konrad Pieszko', 'Maciej Dabrowski', 'Zbigniew Chmielak', 'Wojciech Wojakowski', 'Julia Niemierko', 'Jadwiga Fijalkowska', 'Dariusz Jagielak', 'Philipp Ruile', 'Simon Schoechlin', 'Hesham Elzomor', 'Piotr Slomka', 'Adam Witkowski', 'Damini Dey']",Progress in cardiovascular diseases,2025-04-21,10.1016/j.pcad.2025.04.007,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pcad.2025.04.007,,Paid,Preprocedural CT angiography and machine learning for mortality prediction after transcatheter aortic valve replacement KWIECINSKI 2025,Not available,"['aortic valve replacement', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'machine learning', 'valve replacement', 'aortic valve', 'Preprocedural CT angiography', 'transcatheter aortic', 'TAVR', 'machine', 'learning']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Aortic stenosis', 'CT angiography', 'Machine learning', 'Risk scores', 'TAVR']"
40266968,Five-Year Mortality of Surgical and Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in the Real-World Scenario: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Propensity Score Matching Studies.,"INTRODUCTION: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) provide evidence of efficacy, while real-world data (RWD) demonstrate effectiveness in real-world practice. We designed a systematic review and meta-analysis of reconstructed time-to-event (RTE) data from propensity score matching studies comparing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) to compare their effectiveness and evaluate the generalizability of TAVI indications.
METHODS: Systematic review of literature between 2007 and 2023 including propensity score matching studies comparing TAVI or SAVR that reported at least one-year Kaplan-Meier curves of endpoints.
RESULTS: Twenty-one studies were included (39538 participants). TAVI shows a higher all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.41; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.34-1.47, P-value < 0.001), with a significant heterogeneity. The analysis of HR trend over time shows that TAVI superiority is limited to the first month with a steep reversal afterwards, when SAVR becomes clearly superior. All-cause mortality is significantly higher in TAVI in low-risk (HR 1.35; 95% CI 1.08-1.69, P-value < 0.001) as well as in intermediate (HR 1.73; 95% CI 1.35-2.22, P-value < 0.001) and high-risk (HR 1.61; 95% CI 1.38-1.88, P-value < 0.001) patients. The HR trend in the subgroups of risk confirms the data from the whole mixed population.
CONCLUSION: In a real-word setting, TAVI is associated with higher incidence of all-cause death and maintains a survival benefit only in the first month after implantation. These results show that TAVI effectiveness may not reflect the efficacy demonstrated by RCTs and pose a threat to their external validity.","['Mateo Marin-Cuartas', 'Bianca Dalbesio', 'Francesco Pollari', 'Matteo Scarpanti', 'Amedeo Anselmi', 'Manuela de la Cuesta', 'Miguel Sousa Uva', 'Jean-Philippe Verhoye', 'Francesco Musumeci', 'Fabio Barili', 'Alessandro Parolari']",Brazilian journal of cardiovascular surgery,2025-04-23,10.21470/1678-9741-2024-0048,https://doi.org/10.21470/1678-9741-2024-0048,PMC12017277,Free,Five Year Mortality of Surgical and Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in the Real World Scenario A Systematic Review and Meta Analysis of Propensity Score Matching Studies MARIN-CUARTAS 2025,pdfs\Five Year Mortality of Surgical and Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in the Real World Scenario A Systematic Review and Meta Analysis .pdf,"['Cardiac Surgery', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'TAVI', 'Aortic Valve', 'Propensity Score Matching', 'studies comparing TAVI', 'Score Matching Studies', 'surgical aortic valve', 'Cardiac Surgery Unit']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Aortic Valve', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Systematic Review', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement']"

METHODS: We enrolled 81 patients diagnosed with severe AS and 22 controls. Comparative analyses were performed between the groups, and longitudinal follow-up assessments tracked the incidence of MACEs. Survival analysis, utilizing Kaplan-Meier curves, was employed to determine the prognostic significance of TMAD parameters.
RESULTS: TMAD parameters showed negative linear correlations with left ventricle global longitudinal strain (LVGLS). Overall, 69 patients (85.2%) underwent successful transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), which significantly improves myocardial longitudinal systolic function. MACE occurred in 12 (14.8%) AS patients during the follow-up period.
CONCLUSION: TMAD parameters allowed early detection of left ventricle systolic dysfunction (LVSF) in severe AS patients with normal ejection fraction and correlated well with LVGLS, and TMADmid-A4C was a strong predictor of MACE in severe AS patients with preserved LVEF.","['Jie Feng', 'Yao Li', 'Shiyuan Zhang', 'Haixia Wei', 'Hangyu Liu', 'Yanqing Wu']",Journal of clinical ultrasound : JCU,2025-04-23,10.1002/jcu.24032,https://doi.org/10.1002/jcu.24032,,Paid,Evaluation of Tissue Annular Motion Displacement in Patients With Severe Aortic Stenosis With Normal Ejection Fraction FENG 2025,Not available,"['Tissue Annular Motion', 'Annular Motion Displacement', 'Severe Aortic Stenosis', 'Normal Ejection Fraction', 'Annular Motion', 'Tissue Annular', 'Motion Displacement', 'Simpson method ejection', 'Ejection Fraction', 'method ejection fraction']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['LVEF', 'aortic stenosis', 'speckle tracking imaging', 'tissue motion annular displacement', 'transthoracic echocardiography']"
40264567,Transcatheter aortic valve replacement via direct aortic access for severe aortic stenosis with double aortic arch.,"Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is an established treatment for managing severe aortic stenosis. Preoperative planning requires cautious identification of the access route, which can be challenging in patients with anatomical abnormalities of the aorta. Double aortic arch (DAA) is a congenital condition where the aorta bifurcates into two separate vessels that encircle the trachea and esophagus, thereby forming a vascular ring. This condition accounts for ~1% of congenital cardiovascular anomalies. Previous reports on TAVR performed on patients with DAA are limited, and there is no consensus on the appropriate access route. Herein, we present an 85-year-old female patient with DAA and aortic stenosis who underwent a successful TAVR using the direct aortic approach.","['Akihito Arai', 'Mimiko Tabata', 'Kenichiro Takahashi', 'Ryo Izubuchi', 'Minako Hayakawa', 'Joshi Tsutsumi', 'Akihiro Urabe']",Journal of surgical case reports,2025-04-12,10.1093/jscr/rjaf251,https://doi.org/10.1093/jscr/rjaf251,PMC12013706,Free,Transcatheter aortic valve replacement via direct aortic access for severe aortic stenosis with double aortic arch ARAI 2025,pdfs\Transcatheter aortic valve replacement via direct aortic access for severe aortic stenosis with double aortic arch ARAI 2025.pdf,"['aortic', 'Transcatheter aortic valve', 'double aortic arch', 'direct aortic approach', 'aortic valve replacement', 'aortic arch', 'TAVR', 'severe aortic stenosis', 'aortic valve', 'direct aortic']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['direct aortic approach', 'double aortic arch', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"
40262657,SINGLE PERCLOSE PLUS PLUG BASED DEVICE VERSUS DOUBLE PERCLOSE FOR PERCUTANEOUS LARGE BORE ARTERIAL ACCESS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META ANALYSIS.,"OBJECTIVE: Vascular Closure primarily utilizing Suture Based Devices (SBD) are frequently used for large bore percutaneous arterial access in patients undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVR) and Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (EVAR). Little is known about the intentional combination of SBD with PBD. Main objective was to determine the efficacy of adopting a combined SBD and PBD strategy compared to double SBD for large bore arterial access.
REVIEW METHODS: We searched randomized and observational studies comparing both strategies and that reported the outcomes of major vascular and vascular complications, major bleeding, all bleeding events, need for surgical or endovascular interventions, device failure, additional device and pseudoaneurysm. A meta-analysis was conducted, with heterogeneity assessed using the I2 statistic and a random-effects model applied to all outcomes. Additionally, trial sequential analysis was performed.
RESULTS: We included 3 randomized trials and 4 observational studies with 2,064 access. Sheath size ranged from 13 to 24 Fr. Vascular complications (RR 0.54; p<0.01), major vascular complications (RR 0.55; p=0.04), major bleeding (RR 0.49; p=0.02), need for surgical intervention (RR 0.25; p=0.01), and additional device (RR 0.12; p<0.01) were significantly less common in patients treated with the SBD and PBD technique. Pseudoaneurysm (RR 1.13; p=0.71), all bleeding events (RR 0.59; p=0.1), and endovascular intervention (RR 0.65; p=0.26) were not significantly different between groups.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that one SBD, combined with PBD, was associated with less femoral access complications when compared to the exclusive double SBD as a vascular closure strategy in patients with large bore arterial access.","['Enrico Prajiante Bertolino', 'Milena Monteiro Mastra Fontoura', 'Cynthia Florêncio de Mesquita', 'Dilson da Silva Pimentel', 'Miguel Godeiro Fernandez', 'Ivo Queiroz', 'Braiana Ángeles Díaz Herrera', 'Altino Ono Moraes', 'Ross Millner', 'Grace Carvajal Mulatti']",Annals of vascular surgery,2025-04-20,10.1016/j.avsg.2025.04.107,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.avsg.2025.04.107,,Paid,SINGLE PERCLOSE PLUS PLUG BASED DEVICE VERSUS DOUBLE PERCLOSE FOR PERCUTANEOUS LARGE BORE ARTERIAL ACCESS A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META ANALYSIS BERTOLINO 2025,Not available,"['VERSUS DOUBLE PERCLOSE', 'SINGLE PERCLOSE', 'PLUG BASED DEVICE', 'BASED DEVICE VERSUS', 'LARGE BORE ARTERIAL', 'BORE ARTERIAL ACCESS', 'Aortic Valve Implantation', 'DEVICE VERSUS DOUBLE', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'PERCLOSE PLUS PLUG']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Angioseal', 'Closure device', 'Endovascular aneurysm repair', 'Perclose', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement', 'vascular closure']"
40262017,Perioperative Outcomes in Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement with Concomitant Mitral Regurgitation: A Meta-Analysis.,"Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is widely performed in high-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis. However, the effects of baseline concomitant mitral regurgitation (MR) on perioperative outcomes remain unclear. This study evaluated the impact of concomitant MR severity on short-term TAVR outcomes. A systematic search of 6 electronic databases was conducted. Studies that stratified patients based on MR severity (MR ≥2 vs. <2 or MR ≥3 vs. <3) and reported perioperative outcomes, including short-term mortality, in-hospital mortality, acute kidney injury (AKI), pacemaker implantation, bleeding, vascular complications, and MR improvement (up to 1 week and 1 month) were eligible. Data from 26 studies (32,453 patients) demonstrated that patients with baseline moderate-to-severe MR (MR ≥2) had a 49% (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.32-1.70) increased risk of short-term mortality, a 41% (95% CI, 1.22-1.63) higher risk of in-hospital mortality, and a 38% (95% CI, 1.17-1.62) higher risk of AKI than those with none-to-mild MR (MR<2). Patients with an MR ≥3 had an even greater 72% (95% CI, 1.37-2.16) increase in short-term mortality. No significant differences were observed in pacemaker implantation, bleeding, or vascular complications between groups. Additionally, after TAVR, MR improved in 36% of patients by at least 1 grade within 1 week, increasing to 44% by 1 month.

This study investigates sex-related differences in survival and safety outcomes in patients with aortic stenosis undergoing TAVR.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Library until November 2024. Individual patient data (IPD) were reconstructed from published Kaplan-Meier curves and compared using Cox-proportional hazards model for overall survival and cardiovascular mortality. Pooled risk ratios (RR) for safety outcomes at 30-days and one year were estimated using a random-effects model. A total of 48 studies (69,355 women and 65,580 men) were included. Meta-analysis of reconstructed IPD showed that men were at higher risk of all-cause mortality at five years (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.24, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.20-1.28, P<0.001) and cardiovascular mortality at four years (HR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.21-1.49, P<0.001) compared with women. In random-effects meta-analysis, men faced a higher risk of permanent pacemaker implantation (RR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.16-1.44, P<0.001) during the first year. Men experienced a lower risk of stroke (RR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.64-0.87, P<0.001) and major vascular complications (RR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.49-0.69, P<0.001) at 30 days, and a lower risk of major bleeding (RR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.70-0.84, P<0.001) as well as major vascular complications (RR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.43-0.68, P<0.001) within the first year.
CONCLUSION: Men demonstrated poorer five-year overall survival and four-year cardiovascular survival following TAVR compared with women.

40260550,Impact of Calcified Raphe on TAVR in Bicuspid Patients: Predicting Redo-TAVR Feasibility and Virtual Planning Implications.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with bicuspid aortic stenosis who receive transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) may require subsequent valve interventions in their lifetime; however, the feasibility of redo-TAVR in this population is uncertain. We aimed to assess redo-TAVR feasibility in bicuspid patients and develop a predictive virtual valve planning algorithm.
METHODS: We studied computed tomography scans of bicuspid patients who received a balloon-expandable transcatheter heart valve (THV) in the LRT trial (Low Risk TAVR). Redo-TAVR feasibility, determined by valve-to-coronary and valve-to-aorta measurements on 30-day computed tomography, was assessed according to raphe location and calcification. A virtual valve planning algorithm was developed using baseline and 30-day computed tomography scans.
RESULTS: Among 42 patients (left/right cusp fusion: n=34; right/noncusp fusion: n=4; 2-sinus: n=4), redo-TAVR was feasible in 64%, while 36% would likely require leaflet modification to prevent coronary obstruction. Patients with left/right fusion and calcified raphe had higher redo-TAVR feasibility (88% versus 35%, P<0.001) due to favorable shifting of the THV away from the coronary ostia. A bicuspid virtual planning algorithm accounting for 83.4% THV underexpansion, resulting in an 11.9% taller frame and translation of the THV away from the calcified raphe (mean valve shift 6.6 mm) achieved 86.7% sensitivity and 88.9% specificity for predicting redo-TAVR feasibility.
CONCLUSIONS: Calcified raphe in left/right cusp fusion shifts the THV away from the coronary ostia, reducing coronary obstruction risk during redo-TAVR. Underexpansion causing increased THV frame height and valve shifting is common in bicuspid patients; a virtual planning algorithm accounting for these aspects can accurately assess redo-TAVR risk.

AIMS: We aimed to assess different strategies of PCI timing in this high-risk TAVI cohort.
METHODS: The ASCoP registry retrospectively included patients with a clinical indication for both TAVI and PCI with at least 1 criterion of complex or high-risk PCI. The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause death and unplanned rehospitalisation for cardiovascular causes. The secondary endpoint was a composite of all-cause death, stroke, acute myocardial infarction, major bleeding, major vascular complication and unplanned revascularisation. Multivariable analysis was used to adjust for possible confounders.
RESULTS: A total of 519 patients were included: 363 (69.9%) underwent staged procedures and 156 (30.1%) concomitant TAVI and PCI. After 441 (interquartile range 182-824) days, the primary endpoint occurred in 151 (36.5%) cases, without any significant difference between the 2 groups (p=0.98), while the secondary endpoint occurred more frequently in the concomitant group (n=36 [25.8%] vs n=57 [17.4%]; p=0.014).

40259836,Prognostic value of invasive versus echocardiography-derived aortic gradient in patients undergoing TAVI.,"BACKGROUND: Recent studies report a discordance between invasive and echocardiography-derived gradients after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) with balloon-expandable (BEV) and self-expanding valves (SEV). There are limited data on the determinants and clinical implications of this discordance.
AIMS: We aimed to examine the prognostic value of invasive and echocardiography-derived gradients after implantation of SEV and BEV and to compare gradients for SEV versus BEV.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective, propensity score-matched study. Invasive measurements were obtained before and immediately after TAVI. Echocardiography was performed before and within 24 hours after TAVI, and at 1 year. Clinical outcomes were assessed at 30 days, 1 year, and 2 years.
RESULTS: The 1:1 propensity score matching resulted in 436 matched pairs (436 SAPIEN 3 and 436 Evolut). Invasive gradients post-TAVI independently predicted higher risk for all-cause mortality at 30 days, 1 year and 2 years as a continuous variable (hazard ratio [HR] 1.07, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.00-1.14; p=0.038; HR 1.06, 95% CI: 1.01-1.11; p=0.007; HR 1.05, 95% CI: 1.01-1.09; p=0.011, respectively) and by using >10 mmHg as a cutoff (HR 1.95, 95% CI: 1.13-4.78; p=0.028; HR 1.91, 95% CI: 1.11-3.65; p=0.030; HR 1.61, 95% CI: 1.03-2.96; p=0.021, respectively), but echocardiography-derived gradients did not (HR 1.13, 95% CI: 0.87-1.75; p=0.247; HR 1.02, 95% CI: 0.95-1.10; p=0.639; HR 0.99, 95% CI: 0.94-1.07; p=0.979, respectively). Mean gradients before and after TAVI were higher by echocardiography than by invasive measurements. The difference was more pronounced after implantation with BEV than SEV (7.0 [25th-75th percentile: 4.0-11.0] mmHg vs 5.0 [2.0-7.0] mmHg; p<0.001). Smaller valve size, higher ejection fraction and higher stroke volume amplified the discordance. Invasive mean gradients were similar after SEV and BEV (3.0 [0.0-6.0] mmHg vs 3.0 [0.0-6.0] mmHg; p=0.166), but echo-derived mean gradients were lower after SEV versus BEV (8.0 [6.0-11.0] mmHg vs 11.0 [8.0-14.0] mmHg; p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Only invasively measured but not echocardiography-derived transvalvular mean gradients correlate with 30-day, 1-year and 2-year mortality. Aortic gradient measurements are higher by echocardiography than by invasive assessment and more so for BEV than SEV. Smaller valve size, higher ejection fraction and higher stroke volume increase this discordance between echocardiography and invasive assessment.","['Mark M P van den Dorpel', 'Sraman Chatterjee', 'Rik Adrichem', 'Sarah Verhemel', 'Isabella Kardys', 'Rutger-Jan Nuis', 'Joost Daemen', 'Claire Ben Ren', 'Alexander Hirsch', 'Marcel L Geleijnse', 'Nicolas M Van Mieghem']",EuroIntervention : journal of EuroPCR in collaboration with the Working Group on Interventional Cardiology of the European Society of Cardiology,2025-04-21,10.4244/EIJ-D-24-00341,https://doi.org/10.4244/EIJ-D-24-00341,PMC11995293,Paid,Prognostic value of invasive versus echocardiography derived aortic gradient in patients undergoing TAVI DORPEL 2025,Not downloaded,"['patients undergoing TAVI', 'SEV versus BEV', 'SEV', 'BEV', 'gradients', 'invasive', 'TAVI', 'mmHg', 'undergoing TAVI', 'echocardiography-derived gradients']",2025-05-12,Pending,[]
40258409,The randomized controlled trial to compare temporary permanent pacemaker vs temporary pacemaker in patients with conduction block after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: Rationale and design of the RECOVER trial.,"RATIONALE: Current guidelines and expert consensus recommend different time thresholds of temporary pacemaker (TM) indwelling in patients with conduction block after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Accordingly, this lack of clinical evidence and effective strategies has resulted in extensive variations in permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation patterns, potentially leading to over-early PPM implantation. The use of a temporary permanent pacemaker (TPPM), which involves an active fixation pacing lead and an external pulse generator secured to the skin surface, may be effective and safe in these patients. TPPM may improve postoperative mobility and facilitate early discharge, while providing prolonged and stable pacing for the recovery of conduction block, thereby reducing unnecessary PPM implantation.
DESIGN: The RECOVER trial is a prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled study comparing TPPM vs TM in patients with conduction block after TAVR. The trial will enroll 160 subjects across 13 sites in China. Inclusion criteria include patients with persistent third-degree atrioventricular block (AVB), second-degree AVB, first-degree AVB with symptoms (PR interval >300 ms), alternating bundle branch block or bifascicular block with syncope/blackness related symptoms occurred during TAVR procedure or within 1 month after TAVR. Enrolled patients will be randomized 1:1 to the TPPM group for a 1-month bridge or the TM group for conventional 24 to 48 hours pacing. The primary effectiveness endpoint is the rate of PPM implantation at 6 months after the occurrence of AVB. Secondary effectiveness endpoint is the rate of PPM implantation at 1 month after the occurrence of AVB. Safety endpoints include all-cause mortality and TPPM/TM/PPM procedure-related complications during the 6-month follow-up. Key data collected will include sociodemographic information, medical history, electrocardiograph, HOLTER, echocardiography, contrast-enhanced cardiac CT, details of procedures and pacemaker interrogation. Indication for PPM implantation will be adjudicated by an independent pacing electrophysiologist committee.
CONCLUSION: The RECOVER trial will evaluate whether TPPM is superior to conventional TM in reducing the rate of PPM implantation in patients with conduction block after TAVR, with a buffer period to distinguish whether conduction block is reversible or persistent.

40254143,Management of TAVR in asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients: Insights from resting angiographic microvascular resistance.,"BACKGROUND: The optimal timing of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) remains controversial. Microvascular dysfunction and increased microcirculatory resistance have been linked to adverse outcomes in AS, suggesting that resting angiographic microvascular resistance (AMRr) may aid in identifying higher-risk patients.
METHOD: We conducted a retrospective study of 180 severe AS patients who underwent TAVR at Fuwai Hospital between 2012 and 2021. Patients were grouped based on an AMRr cutoff value of 490, identified through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The primary endpoint was the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), including all-cause mortality, heart failure, and myocardial infarction. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were used to compare outcomes between groups.
RESULTS: A total of 180 asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic AS patients undergoing TAVR were enrolled. After a 40-month follow-up, the AMRr >490 group had a higher MACE risk, mainly driven by readmission for heart failure. Additionally, continuous analysis indicated that every 100-unit increase in AMRr was associated with an 18 %, 17 %, and 1.58-fold increased risk of MACE, all-cause mortality, and NOAF, respectively. Moreover, the addition of AMRr to a clinical model significantly improved the prediction of MACE (AUC 0.678 vs. 0.582, p = 0.023).
CONCLUSION: Asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic AS patients with AMRr >490 had a significantly higher incidence of MACE and heart failure rehospitalization than those with AMRr ≤490 after TAVR. The inclusion of AMRr in a predictive model improved the accuracy for long-term MACE, demonstrating an incremental prognostic value.","['Wence Shi', 'Moyang Wang', 'Guannan Niu', 'Zhenyan Zhao', 'Zheng Zhou', 'Dejing Feng', 'Yongjian Wu', 'Hongliang Zhang']",International journal of cardiology,2025-08-01,10.1016/j.ijcard.2025.133263,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcard.2025.133263,,Paid,Management of TAVR in asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients Insights from resting angiographic microvascular resistance SHI 2025,Not available,"['angiographic microvascular resistance', 'resting angiographic microvascular', 'asymptomatic or minimally', 'minimally symptomatic patients', 'minimally symptomatic', 'TAVR', 'MACE', 'patients', 'Insights from resting', 'angiographic microvascular']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Asymptomatic aortic stenosis', 'Microvascular dysfunction', 'Resting angiographic microvascular resistance', 'Transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"

CASE SUMMARY: This article presents the case of a 74-year-old man who presented with dyspnea and was diagnosed with severe aortic regurgitation. TAVR with a self-expanding valve was performed but complicated with valve migration toward the left ventricle, resulting in severe paravalvular regurgitation. Ultimately, the valve dragging technique was used to reposition the initial valve and a second valve was implanted, achieving satisfactory final outcomes.
DISCUSSION: This technique provides a novel strategy for valve migration after TAVR, avoiding surgical reintervention.

40252068,Unusual Case of Acute Type A Aortic Dissection During TAVR Bailout With a Self-Expanding Valve.,"BACKGROUND: Over the past 2 decades, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has emerged as a widely accepted treatment for patients with severe aortic valve stenosis. Acute aortic dissection, although rare, is a life-threatening complication associated with TAVR.
CASE SUMMARY: An older man with severe aortic stenosis underwent TAVR. During valve deployment, catheter manipulation caused intimal disruption, leading to acute type A aortic dissection (TAAD). Remarkably, the dissection spontaneously sealed after prosthetic valve placement, thereby avoiding emergency surgery. A 6-month follow-up computed tomography angiography scan showed no extension of the dissection.
DISCUSSION: In the case we report, the dissection spontaneously sealed with the use of a prosthetic valve, a finding that reinforces the feasibility of nonsurgical management of iatrogenic TAAD during TAVR in select cases.
TAKE-HOME MESSAGE: The use of a biological valve offers a novel perspective on the conservative management of iatrogenic aortic dissection in high-risk patients during TAVR.","['Lianyue Ma', 'Yongfeng Liang', 'Wei Gao', 'Mei Dong', 'Xiangjuan Liu', 'Yuan Cao', 'Xiao Meng', 'Guipeng An']",JACC.

CASE SUMMARY: A 75-year-old man presented with cardiogenic shock resulting from severe AS and CAD. Emergency surgery was performed. It involved initiation of extracorporeal circulatory support, followed by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and, subsequently, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) using a TaurusElite valve (Peijia Medical). This strategy resulted in marked hemodynamic improvement.
DISCUSSION: This case highlights the efficacy and safety of concurrent PCI and TAVR as a lifesaving strategy for cardiogenic shock patients with concomitant severe CAD and AS.

40252063,One-Stop TEVAR and TAVR Procedure for Severe Aortic Stenosis With Aortic Arch Aneurysm.,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become the fundamental treatment for patients with aortic stenosis (AS). Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is also recommended for penetrating aortic ulcer. Especially in older patients with severe AS and penetrating aortic ulcer at the same time, the surgical method brings significant risk.
CASE SUMMARY: We report a case of a 74-year-old male patient who presented with a 10-day history of dyspnea. He was diagnosed with severe AS with aortic valve insufficiency (penetrating aortic ulcer) and had multiple comorbidities. The patient underwent a 1-stop TEVAR + TAVR procedure.
DISCUSSION: The challenge was compounded by the patient's extremely narrow femoral access. This case demonstrates the 2 operations can be performed as a procedure.

CASE SUMMARY: We report successful noncoronary sinus pivot implantation (NCPI) of a 29-mm self-expanding valve in a high-risk PAR patient (Society of Thoracic Surgeons 8.2%) with extreme root dilatation and no calcification under the STABLE protocol. Post-procedure imaging confirmed hemodynamic success, no paravalvular leak, ventricular recovery, and optimal root remodeling.
DISCUSSION: This case highlights the role of annular-subannular anchoring (NCPI technique) and multimodality imaging in TAVR PAR with sinus of Valsalva aneurysm, addressing migration risks and expanding procedural feasibility beyond calcific stenosis-a critical advancement in an understudied population.

KEY STEPS: Our key steps included the following: 1) unsuccessful withdrawal of the buckled delivery system and valve into the inline sheath; 2) transradial snaring of the delivery system, followed by traction from both ends to reduce the amount of buckling; and 3) once elongated as much as possible, the malfunctioning Evolut delivery system and valve were removed as a unit over the wire.
POTENTIAL PITFALLS: Aortic, iliac, or femoral injury: Reliant balloon was placed in the distal aorta use in case of arterial rupture.
TAKE-HOME MESSAGES: The Evolut delivery system can buckle and accordion under tension in complex aortic anatomy. A technique of snaring from above and tension from below can mitigate the buckled area and allow removal of the damaged delivery system via the endovascular route.","['Ahmed Ghoneem', 'Mubashir Mumtaz', 'Paul D Mahoney']",JACC.

40248298,Ten years of transcatheter aortic valve implantation in the NOTION study: the good and the bad.,"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has transformed the treatment of severe aortic stenosis, becoming a preferred option for patients at high and moderate surgical risk and for individuals over 75 years of age. The NOTION study represents the first randomized clinical trial to reach a 10-year follow-up in patients at low surgical risk, comparing TAVI with surgical valve replacement (SAVR). The results show comparable clinical outcomes between TAVI and SAVR in terms of all-cause mortality, stroke, and myocardial infarction. TAVI demonstrated a better haemodynamic profile and a lower incidence of structural valve deterioration (SVD), but showed higher rates of pacemaker requirement and paravalvular leakage compared with surgical replacement. The trial highlights the excellent durability of transcatheter bioprostheses, although new-generation devices and advanced techniques could further reduce adverse events. The study confirms the increasing role of TAVI even in younger patients, but further long-term data will be needed to evaluate its full potential.","['Luigi Ferrarotto', 'Sebastiano Immè', 'Claudia Tamburino', 'Corrado Tamburino']",European heart journal supplements : journal of the European Society of Cardiology,2025-03-12,10.1093/eurheartjsupp/suaf039,https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartjsupp/suaf039,PMC12001784,Free,Ten years of transcatheter aortic valve implantation in the NOTION study the good and the bad FERRAROTTO 2025,pdfs\Ten years of transcatheter aortic valve implantation in the NOTION study the good and the bad FERRAROTTO 2025.pdf,"['TAVI', 'SAVR', 'TAVI group', 'patients', 'SAVR group', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'aortic valve', 'aortic valve implantation', 'valve', 'surgical valve replacement']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Commissural alignment', 'NOTION study', 'Severe aortic stenosis', 'TAVI (transcatheter aortic valve implantation)', 'Valvular structural deterioration (SVD)']"
40248296,Even aortic insufficiency can be treated percutaneously: right?,"Moderate or severe aortic insufficiency (AI) is a relatively rare condition but with significant clinical implications, especially in elderly patients at high surgical risk. Although surgical aortic valve replacement remains the gold standard for treatment, a significant proportion of patients are not eligible due to the high surgical risk. In recent years, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has revolutionized the treatment of aortic stenosis, but its application to AI has encountered significant challenges, mainly related to specific anatomical characteristics of this population. This review provides an overview of the evolution of the transcatheter treatment of AI, highlighting the critical issues of first-generation TAVI devices and the improvements achieved with new-generation and dedicated devices, such as JenaValve and J-Valve. Preliminary data demonstrate encouraging procedural results, including a reduction in residual insufficiency and improved safety in patients at high surgical risk. However, limitations remain, including the high incidence of pacemaker implantation and the lack of long-term randomized clinical trials. In light of technological advances, TAVI represents a promising therapeutic option for selected patients with AI, if performed in high-volume centres with extensive experience in the treatment of aortic disease.","['Nicolò Azzola Guicciardi', 'Alessandro Beneduce', 'Francesco Maisano']",European heart journal supplements : journal of the European Society of Cardiology,2025-03-12,10.1093/eurheartjsupp/suaf026,https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartjsupp/suaf026,PMC12001779,Free,Even aortic insufficiency can be treated percutaneously right?

40240943,Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction Phenotype Is Associated With Early Symptom Onset in Aortic Stenosis and Residual Symptoms After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.,"BACKGROUND: Aortic stenosis can lead to cardiac adaptations and symptoms similar to heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. We hypothesized that a heart failure with preserved ejection fraction phenotype in aortic stenosis is associated with earlier onset of symptoms and reduced symptomatic response after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).
METHODS AND RESULTS: This retrospective cohort study included 469 patients with moderate aortic stenosis. We determined heavy, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary, elder, filling pressure (H2FPEF) score at diagnosis and compared aortic peak jet velocity at onset of dyspnea in patients with low (<6) and high (≥6) H2FPEF score. In a separate cohort of 601 patients undergoing TAVI, we compared New York Heart Association class, NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide), and cardiovascular mortality post-TAVI between patients with low and high H2FPEF scores. In patients with aortic stenosis and a high H2FPEF score (n=43, 9.2%), the median peak jet velocity at onset of dyspnea was 4.2 versus 4.4 m/s in patients with a low H2FPEF score (P<0.001). After TAVI, a high H2FPEF score (n=123, 20%) was associated with a lower proportion of New York Heart Association class I at 30 days (49% versus 61%; P=0.04), persistently elevated NT-proBNP, and higher 5-year rate of cardiovascular mortality (36% versus 30%; P=0.012), compared with a low H2FPEF score.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with aortic stenosis with a heart failure with preserved ejection fraction phenotype are more likely to develop symptoms at lower gradients and have worse outcomes post-TAVI. Randomized trials are warranted to investigate whether medical therapy targeted at heart failure with preserved ejection fraction delays onset of symptoms and improves symptomatic response after TAVI.","['Constantijn S Venema', 'Kees H van Bergeijk', 'Jan A Krikken', 'Hindrik W van der Werf', 'Ad F M van den Heuvel', 'Yvonne L Douglas', 'Ify R Mordi', 'Nicolas Girerd', 'Chim C Lang', 'Carolyn S P Lam', 'Martin B Leon', 'Erik Lipsic', 'Michiel Rienstra', 'Adriaan A Voors', 'Joanna J Wykrzykowska']",Journal of the American Heart Association,2025-05-06,10.1161/JAHA.124.038786,https://doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.124.038786,,Paid,Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction Phenotype Is Associated With Early Symptom Onset in Aortic Stenosis and Residual Symptoms After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation VENEMA 2025,Not available,"['Preserved Ejection Fraction', 'Ejection Fraction Phenotype', 'Aortic Valve Implantation', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Early Symptom Onset', 'Failure With Preserved', 'Preserved Ejection', 'Ejection Fraction', 'Aortic Stenosis', 'Heart Failure']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['H2FPEF score', 'aortic stenosis', 'aortic valve intervention', 'heart failure', 'structural heart disease']"
40240085,Surgical Mitral Valve Repair vs Replacement After Failed Mitral Transcatheter Edge-to-Edge Repair: The CUTTING-EDGE Registry.,"BACKGROUND: The impact of mitral valve (MV) surgery type after failed mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (M-TEER) has not been well studied.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of MV repair vs replacement after failed M-TEER.
METHODS: From 2009 to 2020, a total of 332 patients across 34 centers from the CUTTING-EDGE registry underwent MV surgery after M-TEER. Outcomes were compared between MV repair and replacement. Primary outcomes included 30-day mortality and 1-year survival after MV surgery.
RESULTS: Among enrolled patients (mean age 73.8 ± 10.1 years, median Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality 3.9% [Q1-Q3: 2.2%-6.8%]), 25 (7.5%) underwent repair and 307 (92.5%) underwent replacement. The replacement group had a significantly higher rate of comorbidities, including atrial fibrillation, prior cardiac surgery, more secondary mitral regurgitation, and more devices implanted at index M-TEER (P < 0.05 for all). Replacement patients showed a trend toward higher 30-day mortality (17.7% [52 of 294] vs 4.0% [1 of 25]; P = 0.094). The observed-to-expected ratio of 30-day mortality was 3.6 (95% CI: 1.9-5.3) overall, 3.8 (95% CI: 2.1-5.5) in the replacement group, and 1.7 (95% CI: 0.7-3.3) in the repair group. Replacement patients had higher 1-year mortality (33.3% [65 of 195] vs 10.5% [2 of 19]; P = 0.041). Significantly lower survival rates were observed after replacement at 2 years (P = 0.033) and persisted in the risk-adjusted Cox regression analysis (HR for replacement: 4.24; 95% CI: 1.04-17.31; P = 0.044).
CONCLUSIONS: MV surgery after failed M-TEER is a high-risk procedure associated with higher than expected 30-day mortality, with higher mortality associated with MV replacement. Compared with repair, replacement is associated with higher 1-year mortality and a lower 2-year survival.","['Mateo Marin-Cuartas', 'Jagdip Kang', 'Thilo Noack', 'Manuela de la Cuesta', 'Markus Krane', 'Volkmar Falk', 'Lenard Conradi', 'Christian Hagl', 'Maurizio Taramasso', 'Tom C Nguyen', 'D Scott Lim', 'Gorav Ailawadi', 'Michael J Mack', 'Robert L Smith', 'Anita W Asgar', 'Kendra J Grubb', 'Luigi Pirelli', 'Paolo Denti', 'Thomas Modine', 'Michael J Reardon', 'Tamim M Nazif', 'Vinayak N Bapat', 'Tsuyoshi Kaneko', 'Philipp Kiefer', 'Michael A Borger', 'Gilbert H L Tang', 'Syed Zaid']",JACC.

40239910,Risk of delayed atrioventricular block in patients without procedural conduction disturbances during transcatheter aortic valve replacement.,"BACKGROUND: Among patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), the risk of delayed atrioventricular block (AVB) in those without procedural conduction disturbances (CDs) remains largely unknown. This may affect hospital stay, particularly same- or next-day discharge after the procedure.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the timing, type, and factors associated with delayed (up to 30 days) AVB in patients without procedural CDs.
METHODS: This was a subanalysis of the PROMOTE trial, a prospective multicenter study including consecutive patients without a prior pacemaker undergoing TAVR and with a prespecified strategy for managing CDs. Patients with no prior right bundle branch block and no procedural CDs were included in this study. Data on 30-day occurrence, timing of AVB, and timing of permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI) were collected in a dedicated database and analyzed overall and according to the preprocedural electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities (either first-degree AVB or abnormal QRS).
RESULTS: A total of 675 patients were included, 334 of whom (49.5%) exhibited baseline ECG abnormalities. At 30 days, 23 patients (3.4%) had delayed AVB (0.6% vs 6.3% in patients with normal and abnormal ECGs preprocedurally, respectively; P < .001). Most (74%) delayed AVB occurred on day 1 or 2 after the procedure. In the multivariable analysis, the factors associated with an increased rate of delayed AVB were preexisting abnormal ECG (odds ratio 5.28; 95% confidence interval 1.53-18.27; P = .009) and left ventricular ejection fraction < 50% (odds ratio 4.17; 95% confidence interval 1.75-9.93; P = .001). Among patients in sinus rhythm with a preprocedural abnormal ECG, those with QRS duration > 120 ms and first-degree AVB exhibited the highest risk (PPI rate 17.8%) followed by those with isolated QRS duration > 120 ms (PPI rate 8.7%).
CONCLUSION: Among TAVR recipients with no procedural CDs, those with an abnormal ECG preprocedurally represent a high-risk group for delayed AVB requiring PPI. This would support a tailored strategy, with a minimalist approach (same- or next-day discharge) in low-risk patients and more prolonged hospitalization or continuous ECG ambulatory monitoring in those at higher risk.

40230300,Impact of Elevated Preprocedural Left Ventricular Filling Pressure on Prognosis of Mild Paravalvular Regurgitation Following Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.,"BACKGROUND: Paravalvular regurgitation (PVR) following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a complication linked to poor outcomes. The prognostic impact of mild PVR, particularly in patients with elevated preprocedural left ventricular (LV) filling pressure, remains uncertain.
AIMS: This study aimed to assess the influence of elevated preprocedural LV filling pressure on mild PVR prognosis following TAVR.
METHODS: This single-center, retrospective study analyzed consecutive patients with severe aortic stenosis who underwent TAVR, excluding those with moderate or severe PVR. Preprocedural LV filling pressure was evaluated using baseline E/A ratio, and patients were stratified into four groups based on E/A ratio (≤1 or >1) and PVR severity (none/trace or mild). The primary endpoint was cardiovascular death within 5 years.
RESULTS: Among 904 patients, 466 had E/A ≤ 1 with none/trace PVR, 92 had E/A > 1 with none/trace PVR, 300 had E/A ≤ 1 with mild PVR, and 46 had E/A > 1 with mild PVR. Multivariable analysis identified E/A > 1 with mild PVR as an independent predictor of cardiovascular death (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 2.38; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.28-4.42; p < 0.01). In contrast, E/A > 1 with none/trace PVR (HR: 1.16, 95% CI: 0.66-2.03) and E/A ≤ 1 with mild PVR (HR: 1.33, 95% CI: 0.89-2.00) were not significant predictors compared to E/A ≤ 1 with none/trace PVR.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated preprocedural LV filling pressure is independently associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular death in patients with mild PVR following TAVR.","['Shumpei Kosugi', 'Isamu Mizote', 'Daisuke Nakamura', 'Hiroki Sugae', 'Yutaka Matsuhiro', 'Shota Okuno', 'Ai Kawamura', 'Kizuku Yamashita', 'Koichi Maeda', 'Kazuo Shimamura', 'Tomoharu Dohi', 'Yasuharu Takeda', 'Yasushi Sakata']",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,2025-04-15,10.1002/ccd.31537,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.31537,,Paid,Impact of Elevated Preprocedural Left Ventricular Filling Pressure on Prognosis of Mild Paravalvular Regurgitation Following Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement KOSUGI 2025,Not available,"['Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Mild Paravalvular Regurgitation', 'Preprocedural Left Ventricular', 'Elevated Preprocedural Left', 'mild PVR', 'Paravalvular Regurgitation', 'Valve Replacement', 'PVR', 'Elevated Preprocedural']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['E/A ratio', 'aortic stenosis', 'brain natriuretic peptide', 'left ventricular filling pressure', 'paravalvular regurgitation', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"
40223618,Optimal Oversizing With the New-Generation Evolut (PRO/PRO+/FX) Self-Expanding Valves: A Multicenter Study.,"BACKGROUND: Paravalvular leaks (PVLs) after transcatheter aortic valve replacement have a significant prognostic impact, and valve oversizing, particularly with self-expanding valves, may prevent postprocedural PVL occurrence. Recent iterations of the Evolut valve system are intended to reduce PVL, but the effects of oversizing with such valves on PVL are largely unknown. We aimed to assess, in a real-world contemporary setting, the impact of Evolut valve oversizing on PVL after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.
METHODS: This was a multicenter observational ambispective study of patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement with the Evolut PRO/PRO+/FX valves. Aortic annulus perimeter, as determined by multidetector computed tomography, was used to estimate the oversizing degree. The primary end point was the presence of PVL (mild/moderate-severe), as determined by echocardiography at hospital discharge. Secondary end points included in-hospital outcomes as defined by the Valve Academic Research Consortium-3 recommendations.
RESULTS: A total of 762 patients were included (Evolut PRO/PRO+/FX, 55.5%/34.8%/9.7%), and the median valve oversizing was 20 (17-25)%, with no differences in baseline characteristics between low (≤20%, n=381) and high (>20%, n=381) valve oversizing recipients. In-hospital mortality and stroke rates were 2.4% and 4.3%, respectively, with no oversizing-related differences in clinical outcomes. Permanent pacemaker rates were similar in patients with low (19.4%) and high (15.8%) valve oversizing, P=0.21. PVL was found in 35.6% of patients (mild: 32.6%, moderate-severe: 3.0%), with a higher incidence of PVL in patients with low (40.9%) versus high (30.2%) oversizing, P=0.002. In a multivariable analysis, a higher oversizing degree was associated with a lower risk of PVL (odds ratio, 0.95 [0.92-0.99] for each 1% increase in oversizing, P=0.006).
CONCLUSIONS: In transcatheter aortic valve replacement with recent Evolut valve iterations (PRO/PRO+/FX), a higher oversizing degree was associated with a lower frequency of PVL without increasing the risk of other complications (including permanent pacemaker). These data suggest that a low degree of valve oversizing should be avoided when using Evolut valves, particularly in borderline cases.","['Silvia Mas-Peiro', 'Alberto Alperi', 'Ander Regueiro', 'Ignacio Cruz Gonzalez', 'Domenico Angellotti', 'Francisco Campelo-Parada', 'Marina Urena', 'Pablo Avanzas', 'Pablo Vidal-Cales', 'Gilles Jose Barreira de Sousa', 'Giovanni Esposito', 'Mehdi Tamir', 'Gaspard Suc', 'Anthony Poulin', 'Siamak Mohammadi', 'Marisa Avvedimento', 'Josep Rodés-Cabau']",Circulation.

40222322,Geriatric assessment and results of transcatheter aortic valve implantation.,"INTRODUCTION: Comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) prior to transcatheter aortic valve replacement implantation (TAVI) for severe aortic stenosis (AS) may improve the selection of patients targeted for this strategy. Despite the fact that CGA includes multiple scales, comparative data among them are limited. Our aim was to evaluate the discriminative capacity of different scales used in CGA on the decision of suitability for TAVI implantation and the influence on prognosis after TAVI implantation.
METHODS: Single-center prospective observational study including consecutive patients with severe AS referred for TAVI implantation. A CGA was performed in all patients including scales of functionality, frailty, cognitive impairment and comorbidities. The predictive capacity of each of the scales was evaluated. The development of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE: cardiovascular mortality, heart failure [HF] and stroke) was analyzed during follow-up.
RESULTS: A total of 142 patients were selected as candidates for TAVI (80.2%), and 121 were finally implanted. The mean age was 83±4.9 years. Patients who were candidates for TAVI had less valvular area, less atrial fibrillation (AF), less cognitive impairment, more autonomy and less frailty. The SPPB frailty and Barthel functional assessment scales were the main scales of the CGA for the TAVI candidacy decision. After TAVI implantation, 21.5% presented a MACE event, with an overall mortality of 19.8% (6.6% cardiovascular). Patients with a higher rate of events and mortality had more AF, HF, renal disease and malnutrition, as well as less family coverage.
CONCLUSIONS: In elderly patients with severe AS, the CGA is a determining factor in the selection of candidates for TAVI, with frailty and functional assessment being the most important aspects. Family support and nutritional status have a high impact on the prognosis of patients after TAVI.","['Cristina de la Rubia-Molina', 'Andrez Felipe Cubides-Novoa', 'María Teresa Madrid-López', 'Elisa Patín-González', 'Verónica Merchán-Ordoñez', 'Martín Negreira-Caamaño', 'Javier Gil-Moreno', 'Alfonso Freites', 'Ignacio Sánchez-Pérez', 'Virginia Mazoteras-Muñoz', 'Jesús Piqueras-Flores']",Medicina clinica,2025-04-12,10.1016/j.medcli.2025.106936,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medcli.2025.106936,,Paid,Geriatric assessment and results of transcatheter aortic valve implantation RUBIA-MOLINA 2025,Not available,"['transcatheter aortic valve', 'TAVI', 'TAVI implantation', 'aortic valve implantation', 'Comprehensive geriatric assessment', 'transcatheter aortic', 'aortic valve', 'CGA', 'aortic valve replacement', 'patients']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Aortic stenosis', 'Cardio-geriatrics', 'Cardiogeriatría', 'Comprehensive geriatric assessment', 'Estenosis aórtica', 'Fragilidad', 'Frailty', 'Implante transcatéter de prótesis aórtica', 'Transcatheter aortic valve implantation', 'Valoración geriátrica integral']"
40214963,Long-term age-stratified outcomes after surgical and transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a Dutch cohort study.,"BACKGROUND: While randomised trials have shown that surgical and transcutaneous aortic valve replacement/implantation (SAVR/TAVI) have similar short- to mid-term outcomes, long-term outcome data are scarce. Additionally, no large-scale long-term follow-up data from Dutch databases and TAVI centres have been reported to inform national guidelines.
METHODS: We retrospectively analysed baseline characteristics, 5‑year mortality and re-intervention rates of patients undergoing isolated SAVR or TAVI, stratified by age (65-75, 75-80 and > 80 years old) in the Netherlands Heart Registry.
RESULTS: From 2013 through 2021, 7879 SAVR patients (median age: 73.0 years; interquartile range (IQR): 69.0-77.0; 43.7% female) and 14,461 TAVI patients (median age: 81.0 years; IQR: 77.0-84.0; 49.9% female) were treated in the Netherlands. Patients undergoing TAVI more frequently had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, dialysis, poor mobility, previous stroke, unstable angina and recent myocardial infarction compared with SAVR patients. This higher comorbidity rate in TAVI was observed across all age groups. After 5‑year follow-up, mortality rates were higher after TAVI compared with SAVR (35.5% vs 13.0%; p < 0.001). This difference decreased with increasing age (p for interaction < 0.001). While the aortic re-intervention rate was low in both cohorts, it was higher after SAVR than TAVI (1.9% vs 0.9%; p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Demographics of patients undergoing SAVR versus TAVI in the Netherlands differed substantially. TAVI patients were older and had more comorbidities than SAVR patients, across all age groups. Mortality rates were highest after TAVI, while aortic re-intervention was more common after SAVR. These findings reflect differences in baseline patient characteristics and current daily practice in decision-making by the Heart Teams.","['Kees van Bergeijk', 'Stijn Venema', 'Ad van den Heuvel', 'Rik van der Werf', 'Wobbe Bouma', 'Yvonne Douglas', 'Niki Medendorp', 'Marijke Timmermans', 'Adriaan Voors', 'Joanna J Wykrzykowska']",Netherlands heart journal : monthly journal of the Netherlands Society of Cardiology and the Netherlands Heart Foundation,2025-05-12,10.1007/s12471-025-01944-5,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12471-025-01944-5,PMC12014882,Free,Long term age stratified outcomes after surgical and transcatheter aortic valve replacement a Dutch cohort study BERGEIJK 2025,pdfs\Long term age stratified outcomes after surgical and transcatheter aortic valve replacement a Dutch cohort study BERGEIJK 2025.pdf,"['TAVI', 'SAVR', 'Netherlands Heart Registry', 'SAVR patients', 'SAVR versus TAVI', 'TAVI patients', 'Netherlands', 'Netherlands Heart', 'patients', 'Heart Registry']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Comorbidities', 'Long-term outcomes', 'SAVR', 'TAVI']"

40187364,"SAPIEN 3 versus Myval transcatheter heart valves for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (COMPARE-TAVI 1): a multicentre, randomised, non-inferiority trial.","BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is a guideline-directed treatment for severe aortic stenosis and degenerated aortic bioprostheses. When new transcatheter heart valve (THV) platforms for TAVI are launched, they should be compared with best-in-practice contemporary THVs for their short-term and long-term performance. The COMPARE-TAVI 1 trial was designed to provide a head-to-head comparison of the SAPIEN 3 or SAPIEN 3 Ultra THVs and the Myval or Myval Octacor THVs.
METHODS: This multicentre, all-comers, randomised, non-inferiority trial was done at three university hospitals in Denmark. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, scheduled for transfemoral TAVI, and eligible for treatment with SAPIEN 3 THVs or Myval THVs. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to treatment with SAPIEN 3 (29 mm diameter) or SAPIEN 3 Ultra (20 mm, 23 mm, or 26 mm diameter) THVs or Myval or Myval Octacor THVs (20-32 mm diameter). The TAVI procedure was performed according to local practice and under local anaesthesia unless leaflet laceration was performed. The primary endpoint was a composite of death, stroke, moderate or severe aortic regurgitation, or moderate or severe haemodynamic THV deterioration at 1 year according to Third Valve Academic Research Consortium criteria. All patients assigned to THV treatment were included in the intention-to-treat analysis, and all patients who were treated as randomly assigned were included in the per-protocol analysis. With an expected event rate of 13%, the prespecified non-inferiority margin was 5·3%. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04443023, and is closed to accrual.
FINDINGS: Between June 15, 2020, and Nov 3, 2023, 1031 patients were enrolled. Enrolment was paused twice because of patent-related legal proceedings. Of 1031 patients, 517 patients were randomly assigned to SAPIEN 3 THVs and 514 to Myval THVs. The median patient age was 81·6 years (IQR 77·6-85·0), and 415 (40%) of 1031 patients were female and 616 (60%) were male. The primary endpoint occurred in 67 (13%) of 517 patients randomly assigned to SAPIEN 3 THVs versus 71 (14%) of 514 patients randomly assigned to Myval THVs (risk difference -0·9% [one-sided upper 95% CI 4·4%]; pnon-inferiority=0·019).
INTERPRETATION: Myval THVs were non-inferior to SAPIEN 3 THVs in terms of a 1-year composite endpoint of death, stroke, moderate or severe aortic regurgitation, or moderate or severe haemodynamic THV deterioration.

40177743,Outcomes of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Low-Risk Patients in the United States: A Report From the STS/ACC TVT Registry.,"BACKGROUND: Real-world low-risk transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) outcomes in the United States have not been assessed comprehensively versus pivotal trials, which is a key component of measuring the quality of clinical technology adoption.
METHODS: We identified heart team-designated low-risk patients undergoing TAVR for trileaflet severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons/American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Registry, as well as a subset of patients who met low-risk trial inclusion and exclusion criteria, from January 2020 to March 2024. Outcomes (mortality, stroke, new pacemaker, and ""alive and well,"" defined as alive at 1 year with Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire score ≥60 and ≤10-point decrease from baseline) at 30 days and 1 year were assessed. Multivariable models were developed to assess predictors of death and stroke within 1 year after TAVR.
RESULTS: Among 383 030 patients who underwent TAVR during the study period, 108 407 (28%) were designated low-risk by the heart team, and 68 194 (18%) met other study inclusion and exclusion criteria. Of these, 62% (n=42 093) would have been eligible for the low-risk trials. In the overall heart team-designated low-risk population, 30-day outcomes included 0.8% mortality, 1.5% stroke, and 8.4% new permanent pacemaker requirement; 1-year outcomes included 4.6% mortality, 2.6% stroke, and 90% alive and well. In the trial-eligible population, 0.6% mortality, 1.4% stroke, and 8.0% new permanent pacemaker requirement had occurred by 30 days; values at 1 year included 3.1% mortality, 2.4% stroke, and 92% alive and well. Notable multivariable predictors of 1-year mortality were atrial fibrillation, nontransfemoral access, and lower baseline Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire score.
CONCLUSIONS: One-year outcomes among real-world trial-eligible patients are excellent, but adverse events are higher compared with published clinical trial data, likely because of greater comorbidity burden and lower baseline Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire score. These data can help inform expected outcomes and health status after low-risk TAVR.","['Andrew M Vekstein', 'Zachary K Wegermann', 'Pratik Manandhar', 'Michael J Mack', 'David J Cohen', 'G Chad Hughes', 'J Kevin Harrison', 'Tsuyoshi Kaneko', 'Samir R Kapadia', 'Konstantinos Stathogiannis', 'William F Fearon', 'Suzanne Arnold', 'Andrzej S Kosinski', 'Martin B Leon', 'Wayne B Batchelor', 'Vinod H Thourani', 'Sreekanth Vemulapalli']",Circulation,2025-04-22,10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.124.071838,https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.124.071838,,Paid,Outcomes of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Low Risk Patients in the United States A Report From the STS/ACC TVT Registry VEKSTEIN 2025,Not available,"['ACC TVT Registry', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'ACC TVT', 'Transcatheter Valve Registry', 'United States', 'City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire', 'Cardiology Transcatheter Valve', 'Kansas City Cardiomyopathy', 'TVT Registry']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['aortic valve stenosis', 'quality of life', 'risk', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"

40159704,Predictive power of ALBI score-based nomogram for 30-day mortality following transcatheter aortic valve implantation.,"AIM: This retrospective, multi-center study evaluates the relationships between novel liver function scoring systems - Albumin-Bilirubin (ALBI) score, EZ-ALBI, PALBI, and MELD-XI - and outcomes in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Feature importance was assessed with SHAP-values via the XGBoost-algorithm.
RESULTS: The ALBI score exhibited the strongest association with 30-day mortality after TAVI (AUC = 0.723, p < 0.001), outperforming other scores in this regard and consistently demonstrating predictive power across various subgroup populations. Higher 30-day mortality rates were observed in the higher tertiles of the ALBI score compared to the lower tertiles (log-rank p-value = 0.004). The ALBI-based nomogram (C-index = 0.81, 95% CI:0.73-0.86, p = 0 < 001) demonstrated superior predictive power for 30-day mortality post-TAVI compared to the STS (C-index = 0.71, 95% CI :0.64-0.77, p = 0 < 001). In addition, the nomogram showed a significant improvement in reclassification (69.3%, p < 0.001) and a stronger discrimination 15.2%, p < 0.001) compared to the STS. It integrates nine variables, first ALBI score (SHAP:1.165), including NYHA class (0.594), body mass index (0.510), glomerular filtration rate, creatinine, hemoglobin, gender, predilatation requirement, presence of chronic kidney disease, and providing a comprehensive risk assessment tool.
CONCLUSION: This study exhibits the significance of liver dysfunction with AS patients and suggests incorporating liver function parameters in pre-operative risk assessments for better clinical outcomes in TAVI procedures.","['Abdullah Yildirim', 'Omer Genc', 'Mert Evlice', 'Aslan Erdogan', 'Emre Pacaci', 'Ahmet Ozderya', 'Murat Gokhan Yerlikaya', 'Emre Sezici', 'Yeliz Guler', 'Omer Sen', 'Ahmet Guler', 'Ali Riza Akyuz', 'Levent Korkmaz', 'Ibrahim Halil Kurt']",Biomarkers in medicine,2025-05-12,10.1080/17520363.2025.2483157,https://doi.org/10.1080/17520363.2025.2483157,PMC12051588,Paid,Predictive power of ALBI score based nomogram for 30 day mortality following transcatheter aortic valve implantation YILDIRIM 2025,Not downloaded,"['aortic valve implantation', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'valve implantation', 'ALBI score-based nomogram', 'aortic valve', 'ALBI score', 'transcatheter aortic', 'undergoing transcatheter aortic', 'ALBI score-based', 'ALBI']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['30-day mortality', 'ALBI', 'ALBI-based nomogram', 'STS PROM', 'TAVI', 'albumin-Bilirubin Score', 'severe aortic stenosis']"
40158212,5-Year Outcomes After Transcatheter or Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement in Low-Risk Patients With Aortic Stenosis.,"BACKGROUND: The Evolut Low Risk trial demonstrated that transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) was noninferior to surgery for the primary endpoint of all-cause mortality or disabling stroke at 2 years. Outcomes at 5 years have not been reported.
OBJECTIVES: This study sought to evaluate 5-year clinical and hemodynamic outcomes with TAVR vs surgery in patients from the Evolut Low Risk trial.
METHODS: We randomly assigned low-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis to TAVR or surgery. The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause mortality or disabling stroke. Secondary endpoints included clinical, echocardiographic, and quality-of-life outcomes through 5 years.
RESULTS: A total of 1,414 patients underwent an attempted implant (n = 730 TAVR, n = 684 surgery). The mean age was 74 years (range 51-88 years), and women accounted for 35% of patients. At 5 years the Kaplan-Meier estimate for the primary endpoint of all-cause mortality or disabling stroke was 15.5% for the TAVR group and 16.4% for the surgery group (P = 0.47). The Kaplan-Meier estimates in the TAVR and surgery groups for all-cause mortality were 13.5% and 14.9% (P = 0.39) and for disabling stroke were 3.6% and 4.0% (P = 0.57). Cardiovascular mortality was 7.2% in the TAVR group and 9.3% in the surgery group (P = 0.15). Noncardiovascular mortality in the TAVR group was 6.8% and 6.2% in the surgery group (P = 0.73). A site-level vital status sweep was performed for patients who were lost to follow-up or withdrew from the study. With the addition of these patients, the all-cause mortality rate at 5 years for patients undergoing TAVR was 14.7% and for surgery was 15.2% (P = 0.74). Over 5 years, valve reintervention rate was 3.3% for TAVR and 2.5% for surgery (P = 0.44). A sustained improvement in quality of life was observed in both treatment arms with mean Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire summary score of 88.3 ± 15.8 in TAVR and 88.5 ± 15.8 in surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: At 5 years, patients with severe aortic stenosis who were treated with either TAVR or surgery had comparable rates of all-cause mortality or disabling stroke. Valve durability and performance were excellent in both arms. This midterm evaluation reinforces the position of TAVR as noninferior to surgery in patients with severe aortic stenosis at low surgical risk (Medtronic Evolut Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Low Risk Patients; NCT02701283).","['John K Forrest', 'Steven J Yakubov', 'G Michael Deeb', 'Hemal Gada', 'Mubashir A Mumtaz', 'Basel Ramlawi', 'Tanvir Bajwa', 'John Crouch', 'William Merhi', 'Stephane Leung Wai Sang', 'Neal S Kleiman', 'George Petrossian', 'Newell B Robinson', 'Paul Sorajja', 'Ayman Iskander', 'Pierre Berthoumieu', 'Didier Tchétché', 'Christopher Feindel', 'Eric M Horlick', 'Shigeru Saito', 'Jae K Oh', 'Yoojin Jung', 'Michael J Reardon']",Journal of the American College of Cardiology,2025-04-22,10.1016/j.jacc.2025.03.004,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2025.03.004,,Paid,5 Year Outcomes After Transcatheter or Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement in Low Risk Patients With Aortic Stenosis FORREST 2025,Not available,"['Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Evolut Low Risk', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'Evolut Transcatheter Aortic', 'TAVR', 'Low Risk', 'Low Risk trial', 'Valve Replacement', 'transcatheter aortic', 'Medtronic Evolut Transcatheter']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['TAVR', 'aortic stenosis', 'low-risk', 'supra-annular self-expanding', 'surgery']"

METHODS: Data from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons/American College of Cardiology TVT (Transcatheter Valve Therapy) Registry were analyzed to identify patients who underwent isolated TAVR between January 2012 and October 2022 who had available information on 1-year CoD. The primary outcome was cause-specific (cardiac and noncardiac) mortality at 1 year. Fine and Gray subdistribution hazard models were used to account for the competing risk for cause-specific death.
RESULTS: Of 36,877 patients who died within 1 year after TAVR and had available information on CoD, 11,560 (31.3%) had cardiac death and 25,317 (68.7%) had noncardiac death. There was an initial decline in the risk-adjusted hazards of 1-year cardiac and noncardiac death after TAVR from 2012 to 2017 (adjusted HR per year: 0.95 [95% CI: 0.92-0.97] and 0.92 [95% CI: 0.90-0.93], respectively), followed by an increase from 2018 to 2022 (adjusted HR per year: 1.07 [95% CI: 1.05-1.09] and 1.22 [95% CI: 1.20-1.24], respectively). Age >80 years, comorbidities, poor functional status, nonelective procedure, nonfemoral access, and in-hospital complications were identified as independent predictors of both cardiac and noncardiac death after TAVR.
CONCLUSIONS: Noncardiac causes account for two-thirds of deaths within 1 year after TAVR. Further studies are needed to examine whether the COVID-19 pandemic, the rapid expansion in the number of TAVR sites, or other patient and hospital characteristics contributed to the increased risk for cardiac and noncardiac death after TAVR in recent years.","['Dhaval Kolte', 'Guillaume Marquis-Gravel', 'Amanda Stebbins', 'Andrew M Vekstein', 'Sreekanth Vemulapalli', 'Sammy Elmariah']",JACC.

40102102,Australian Cardiac Outcomes Registry of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation: Report and Update of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation in Australia.,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) procedures performed in Australia are recorded in the national Australian Cardiac Outcomes Registry (ACOR) TAVI Registry. Characteristics of patients and operators are prospectively collected with reference to patient demographics, procedural factors as well as outcomes related to both efficacy and safety metrics.
METHODS: Patient level data reported to the ACOR TAVI Registry from enrolled sites from registry inception up until 31 December 2021 were analysed. Key safety and efficacy metrics were identified and used to assess TAVI performance and outcomes in the Australian setting.
RESULTS: From 10 April 2018 to 31 December 2021, 9,881 consecutive patients underwent a TAVI procedure in Australia across 42 TAVI hospitals. The mean age of patients treated was 81.8 years (± standard deviation [SD] 7.1 years), 40.6% were female and the mean STS (Society for Thoracic Surgeons) score was 5.3% (±SD 4.4%). Overall, 0.3% of the cohort identified as Australian Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander peoples. All-cause mortality at 30 days and 12 months was 1.37% and 5.57% respectively. The 30-day rates of stroke, major vascular complications and newly implanted permanent pacemaker were 2.19%, 1.23% and 10.68% respectively. There were 181 unique primary operators who performed TAVI during this time with an annualised median number of 19 procedures per operator per year (interquartile range [IQR] 42.5) and 63% of operators performed <30 cases per year.
CONCLUSIONS: TAVI is being performed in Australia with the encouraging outcomes described.

40007245,Aortic Root Anatomy and Impact on New-Onset Left Bundle Branch Block After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.,"BACKGROUND: Angulation of virtual basal ring (VBR), also known as aortic annulus, in relation to sino-tubular junction (STJ) may lead to greater exposure of implanted stent to the conduction system, consequently increasing the risk of left bundle branch block (LBBB).
AIMS: We sough to measure the VBR-STJ angle and explore its impact on the development of LBBB post-TAVR.
METHODS: Patients undergoing TAVR using the Sapiens 3 valve between 2016 and 2021, without pre-TAVR conduction anomalies were included. The angle between the VBR and the ascending aorta was measured as the angle between the VBR plane and the plane of the STJ on cardiac CT, along with the annulus dimensions. TAVR implantation depth was measured on fluoroscopy images.
RESULTS: A total of 1204 patients were included, with 145 having new-onset LBBB. The VBR-STJ angle was significantly greater in the new-onset LBBB group (7.3 ± 4.7 vs. 5.9 ± 4.6, p = 0.002), and the difference in implantation depth between the levels of right and none coronary cusp (RCC and NCC) was significantly correlated with the VBR-STJ angle (r = 0.3, p = 0.03). This angle was further associated with new-onset LBBB after adjustment to patient and procedural characteristics (OR 1.08 CI: [1.04, 1.13], p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Patients developing LBBB have larger VBR-STJ angle which was associated with greater depth of implantation of the TAVR valve below the RCC compared to the NCC. Precise understanding of the aortic root anatomy can help to predict onset of LBBB which in turn can inform decision-making regarding optimal way of treating aortic stenosis and may improve procedure planning.","['Habib Layoun', 'Joseph Kassab', 'Michel Chedid El Helou', 'Joseph El Dahdah', 'Odette Iskandar', 'Maryam Muhammad Ali Majeed Saidan', 'Abdelrahman Abushouk', 'Toshiaki Isogai', 'Grant Reed', 'Rishi Puri', 'Oussama M Wazni', 'Amar Krishnaswamy', 'Serge Harb', 'Samir Kapadia']",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,2025-05-12,10.1002/ccd.31434,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.31434,PMC12057298,Free,Aortic Root Anatomy and Impact on New Onset Left Bundle Branch Block After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation LAYOUN 2025,pdfs\Aortic Root Anatomy and Impact on New Onset Left Bundle Branch Block After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation LAYOUN 2025.pdf,"['LBBB', 'TAVR', 'Left Bundle Branch', 'Aortic Root Anatomy', 'Bundle Branch Block', 'onset LBBB', 'VBR', 'STJ angle', 'Patients undergoing TAVR', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['aortic root', 'left bundle branch block', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"
39989358,Aortic Valve Calcification Is Induced by the Loss of ALDH1A1 and Can Be Prevented by Agonists of Retinoic Acid Receptor Alpha: Preclinical Evidence for Drug Repositioning.,"BACKGROUND: To date, the only effective treatment of severe aortic stenosis is valve replacement. With the introduction of transcatheter aortic valve replacement and extending indications to younger patients, the use of bioprosthetic valves (BPVs) has considerably increased. The main inconvenience of BPVs is their limited durability because of mechanisms similar as the fibro-calcifying processes observed in native aortic stenosis. One of the major gaps of the field is to identify therapeutic targets to prevent or slow the fibro-calcifying process leading to severe and symptomatic aortic stenosis.
METHODS: Explanted valves were collected from patients and organ donor hearts. A comparative transcriptomic analysis was performed on valvular interstitial cells (VIC) obtained from calcified (bicuspid and tricuspid) versus control valves. The mechanisms and consequences of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member A1 (ALDH1A1) downregulation were analyzed in VIC cultures from control human aortic valves. ALDH1A1 was inhibited or silenced and its impact on osteogenic marker expression and calcification processes assessed in VIC. The effect of all-trans retinoic acid on calcification was tested on human VIC cultures and on 2 animal models: the model of subcutaneous implantation of bovine pericardium in rats and the model of xenograft aortic valve replacement in juvenile sheep.
RESULTS: Transcriptome analysis of human VIC identified ALDH1A1 as the most downregulated gene in VIC from calcified versus control valves. In human VIC, ALDH1A1 expression is downregulated by TGF-β in a SMAD2/3-dependent manner. ALDH1A1 inhibition promotes an osteoblast-like VIC phenotype and increases calcium deposition through inhibition of retinoic acid receptor alpha signaling. Conversely, VIC treatment with retinoids decreases calcium deposition and attenuates VIC osteoblast activity. Last, all-trans retinoic acid inhibits calcification development of aortic BPV in both in vivo models and improves aortic valve echocardiographic parameters in the xenograft sheep model.
CONCLUSIONS: These results show that ALDH1A1 is downregulated in calcified valves, hence promoting VIC transition into an osteoblastic phenotype. Retinoic acid receptor alpha agonists, including all-trans retinoic acid through a drug repositioning strategy, represent a promising and innovative pharmacological approach to prevent calcification of native aortic valves and BPV.","['Mickael Rosa', 'Annabelle Dupont', 'David M Smadja', 'Jérôme Soquet', 'Johan Abdoul', 'Thibault Pamart', 'Flavien Vincent', 'Christina Le Tanno', 'Eloise Borowczak', 'Timothée Bigot', 'Alexandre Ung', 'Bertrand Vaast', 'Mélanie Daniel', 'Ramadan Jashari', 'Frédéric Mouquet', 'Cedric Delhaye', 'Yoann Sottejeau', 'Jeanne Rancic', 'Delphine Corseaux', 'Francis Juthier', 'Bart Staels', 'Sophie Susen', 'Eric Van Belle']",Circulation,2025-05-06,10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.124.071954,https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.124.071954,,Paid,Aortic Valve Calcification Is Induced by the Loss of ALDH1A1 and Can Be Prevented by Agonists of Retinoic Acid Receptor Alpha Preclinical Evidence for Drug Repositioning ROSA 2025,Not available,"['Preclinical Evidence', 'VIC', 'Retinoic Acid', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor', 'Aortic', 'Aortic Valve', 'aortic valve replacement', 'Acid Receptor Alpha', 'all-trans retinoic acid', 'human VIC']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['ALDH1A1', 'aortic valve stenosis', 'bioprosthetic valves', 'calcification', 'retinoids', 'valvular interstitial cells']"
39981654,Impact of Continuation Versus Interruption of Oral Anticoagulation During TAVI on Health-Related Quality of Life.,"BACKGROUND: One-third of patients undergoing TAVR have a concomitant indication for oral anticoagulation. The impact of continuation as compared to interruption of oral anticoagulation during TAVR on health-related quality of life is unknown.
AIMS: To investigate the impact of continuation as compared to interruption of oral anticoagulation on health-related quality of life.
METHODS: The POPular PAUSE TAVI (Periprocedural Continuation vs. Interruption of Oral Anticoagulant Drugs during Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation) trial was an international, open-label, randomized, clinical trial performed at 22 European sites. Health-related quality of life was assessed using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) and Short Form-12 (SF-12) before, and at 1 and 3 months after TAVR.
RESULTS: A total of 8 patients were included: 431 were assigned to continuation and 427 to interruption of oral anticoagulation. Before TAVR, the mean overall KCCQ summary score was 53.6 (±26.0). At 1 month, the mean change in KCCQ summary score as compared to baseline was +11.4 points (95% confidence interval [CI] 8.0-14.8) in the continuation group and +12.2 points (95% CI 8.8-15.6) in the interruption group (difference -0.7 points; 95% CI -4.6 to 3.1). At 3 months, the mean change was +11.0 points (95% CI 7.3-14.6) versus +13.8 points (95% CI 10.2-17.4), respectively (difference -2.8 points; 95% CI -7.1 to 1.5). Mean changes in SF-12 physical and mental component summary scores showed no differences between both groups at 1 and 3 months after TAVR.

39971704,Impact of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation on Right Ventricular Function.,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence and predictors of right ventricular (RV) dysfunction before and after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) are not known. We aimed to document this and sought to identify specific RV echo thresholds, below which RV improvement was unlikely to occur.
METHOD: Consecutive patients who underwent TAVI between 2017 and 2021 at Macquarie University Hospital (MUH) were included if ≥2 RV functional parameters were available on baseline echo; tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, tissue Doppler (S') and/or RV fractional area change. Prevalence and predictors of baseline RV dysfunction were documented. Patients with a repeat echo performed at MUH at 1-3 months post-TAVI were included in further analyses to assess serial changes in RV function.
RESULTS: Overall, 343 patients had an eligible baseline echo and 97 of these patients (28.2%) had RV dysfunction, pre-TAVI. These patients had significantly higher rates of atrial fibrillation, ischaemic heart disease, and chronic lung disease, than those without (p<0.05 for all). Of 239 patients with 1-3 month follow-up echo data, 66 of these had had baseline RV dysfunction; of these, 20 (30.3%) patients showed improvement and 46 (69.7%) patients showed persistent RV dysfunction. Thresholds with a greater than 90% predictive value for persistent RV dysfunction were identified for each baseline RV functional parameter: tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion <1.4 cm, S'<6, fractional area change <25%.
CONCLUSIONS: Baseline RV dysfunction was present in over a quarter of pre-TAVI patients and persisted at short-term follow-up in over two-thirds of such patients. There were clear thresholds to identify patients where RV recovery was unlikely, after TAVI.","['Seshika Ratwatte', 'Bianca Coelho', 'Martin K Ng', 'David S Celermajer']","Heart, lung & circulation",2025-05-12,10.1016/j.hlc.2024.11.017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hlc.2024.11.017,,Paid,Impact of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation on Right Ventricular Function RATWATTE 2025,Not available,"['Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Aortic Valve Implantation', 'Aortic Valve', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'Valve Implantation', 'patients', 'Macquarie University Hospital', 'dysfunction', 'Ventricular Function', 'baseline']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Aortic stenosis', 'Right ventricular dysfunction', 'Transcatheter aortic valve implantation']"
39965432,Machine learning for predicting outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve implantation: A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) therapy has demonstrated its clear benefits such as low invasiveness, to treat aortic stenosis. Despite associated benefits, still post-procedural complications might occur. The severity of these complications depends on pre-existing clinical conditions and patient specific complex anatomical features. Accurate prediction of TAVI outcomes will assist in the precise risk assessment for patients undergoing TAVI. Throughout the past decade, different machine learning (ML) approaches have been utilized to predict outcomes of TAVI. This systematic review aims to assess the application of ML in TAVI for the purpose of outcome prediction.
METHODS: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline was adapted for searching the PubMed and Scopus databases on ML use in TAVI outcomes prediction. Once the studies that meet the inclusion criteria were identified, data from these studies were retrieved and were further examined. 17 parameters relevant to TAVI outcomes were carefully identified for assessing the quality of the included studies.
RESULTS: Following the search of the mentioned databases, 78 studies were initially retrieved, and 17 of these studies were included for further assessment. Most of the included studies focused on mortality prediction, utilizing datasets of varying sizes and diverse ML algorithms. The most employed ML algorithms were random forest, logistics regression, and gradient boosting. Among the studied parameters, serum creatinine, age, BMI, hemoglobin, and aortic valve mean gradient were identified as key predictors for TAVI outcomes. These predictors were found to be well aligned with established associations in current literature.
CONCLUSION: ML presents a promising opportunity for improving the success and safety of TAVI and enhancing patient-centered care. While currently retrospective studies with low generalizability and heterogeneity form the basis of ML TAVI research, future prospective investigations with highly heterogeneous patient TAVI cohorts will be critically important for firmly establishing the applicability of ML in predicting TAVI outcomes.","['Ruba Sulaiman', 'Md Ahasan Atick Faisal', 'Maram Hasan', 'Muhammad E H Chowdhury', 'Faycal Bensaali', 'Abdulrahman Alnabti', 'Huseyin C Yalcin']",International journal of medical informatics,2025-05-12,10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2025.105840,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2025.105840,,Paid,Machine learning for predicting outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve implantation A systematic review SULAIMAN 2025,Not available,"['transcatheter aortic valve', 'aortic valve implantation', 'TAVI outcomes', 'TAVI', 'transcatheter aortic', 'aortic valve', 'valve implantation', 'TAVI outcomes prediction', 'outcomes', 'aortic']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Aortic stenosis', 'Deep learning', 'Machine learning', 'Outcome prediction', 'TAVI', 'TAVR', 'Transcatheter aortic valve implantation']"
39924368,Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation in Patients at Intermediate and Low Risk Is Not (Yet) the Existential Threat That Surgeons Feared: A Retrospective Analysis of Medicare Claims Data.,"BACKGROUND: In Australia, the role of surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) and transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in patients who are suitable for both procedures remains controversial. In 2022, new Items were added to the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) to allow patients at intermediate and low risk with appropriate private health insurance to undergo TAVI. The Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand supported these changes whereas the Australian and New Zealand Society of Cardiac and Thoracic Surgeons opposed them. The aim of this study was to document subsequent private TAVI activity in patients at intermediate and low risk, relative to both private TAVI activity in patients at high risk and private SAVR activity.
METHOD: A retrospective population-level descriptive study was undertaken, using Medicare claims data obtained from Services Australia.
RESULTS: Among private patients who underwent TAVI, the groups at high, intermediate, and low risk all had a median age between 75 and 84 years. Only 1% were aged ≤64 years (86/6,586), and 80% of these were at high risk (69/86). Among private patients at intermediate and low risk who underwent TAVI and private patients who underwent SAVR, only 4% of patients aged 55-64 years chose private TAVI over private SAVR (8/211), and 63% of these were at intermediate risk (5/8).
CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of MBS Items for private TAVI in patients at intermediate and low risk without accompanying age exclusion criteria has not (yet) had a major impact on private SAVR activity.

39903642,The reversibility of cardiac damage after transcatheter aortic valve implantation and short-term outcomes in a real-world setting.,"AIMS: This study aims to assess the changes in cardiac damage stage in a real-world cohort of patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), and to investigate the prognostic value of cardiac damage stage evolution.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing TAVI were retrospectively analysed. A five-stage system based on the presence and extent of cardiac damage assessed by echocardiography was applied before and 6 months after TAVI. Multivariable Cox regression analyses were used to examine independent prognostic value of the changes in cardiac damage after TAVI. A total of 734 patients with severe AS (mean age, 79.8 ± 7.4 years; 55% male) were included. Before TAVI, 32 (4%) patients did not show any sign of extra-valvular cardiac damage (Stage 0), 85 (12%) had left ventricular damage (Stage 1), 220 (30%) left atrial and/or mitral valve damage (Stage 2), 227 (31%) pulmonary vasculature and/or tricuspid valve damage (Stage 3), and 170 (23%) right ventricular damage (Stage 4). Six months after TAVI, 39% of the patients improved at least one stage in cardiac damage.

39894430,Paravalvular Leak After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation: Results From 3600 Patients.,"BACKGROUND: Paravalvular leak (PVL) after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is associated with poor outcomes. Mild PVL remains prevalent after TAVI, and its impact on long-term survival is unclear. This study aimed to examine the incidence, impact on survival, and progression of PVL.
METHODS: This was a retrospective, single-institution cohort study of TAVIs between November 2012 and January 2023. Patients were stratified by 30-day PVL severity: none to trace, mild, and moderate to severe. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify risk factors associated with increasing PVL severity. Kaplan-Meier survival estimation and Cox proportional hazards regression were performed.
RESULTS: A total of 3600 patients underwent TAVI. Of these, 2719 (75.5%) had none to trace PVL, 808 (22.5%) had mild PVL, and 73 (2.0%) had moderate to severe PVL at 30 days. On multivariable logistic regression, later years of valve implantation (2017-2023) were protective against PVL progression. Kaplan-Meier estimates of the 3 groups were significantly different (P < .001) with the moderate to severe group having reduced survival. On Cox regression, moderate to severe PVL was associated with increased mortality (hazard ratio, 1.80; 95% Cl, 1.31-2.46; P < .001), whereas mild PVL was not (hazard ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.89-1.15; P = .88) compared with none to trace PVL. For Kaplan-Meier estimates comparing the none to trace and mild PVL groups alone, landmark analysis showed reduced survival in the mild PVL group after 2 years (P = .03); however, this late reduction in survival in the mild PVL group did not persist on multivariable analysis (P = .14).
CONCLUSIONS: After TAVI, moderate to severe PVL is associated with reduced survival compared with none to trace PVL. Mild PVL may result in a delayed survival reduction.","['Nav Warraich', 'James A Brown', 'Eishan Ashwat', 'Dustin Kliner', 'Derek Serna-Gallegos', 'Catalin Toma', 'David West', 'Amber Makani', 'Yisi Wang', 'Ibrahim Sultan']",The Annals of thoracic surgery,2025-05-12,10.1016/j.athoracsur.2025.01.012,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.athoracsur.2025.01.012,,Paid,Paravalvular Leak After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation Results From 3600 Patients WARRAICH 2025,Not available,"['Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Aortic Valve Implantation', 'PVL', 'Mild PVL', 'Paravalvular Leak', 'Valve Implantation', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'Aortic Valve', 'severe PVL', 'trace PVL']",2025-05-12,Pending,[]

39855450,Outcomes and Predictors of Different Flow-Gradient Patterns of Aortic Stenosis After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.,"This study sought to explore the clinical factors associated with classical low-flow low-gradient (C-LFLG) and normal-flow low-gradient (NFLG) aortic stenosis (AS) compared with high-gradient (HG) AS. We also compared clinical and echocardiographic outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) across flow-gradient patterns. Patients with C-LFLG AS have a higher mortality rate after TAVR than those with HG AS. However, what leads to C-LFLG AS and the predictors of mortality in this population remain unclear. In this retrospective, single-center study involving 1,415 patients with severe AS, patients were classified as having (1) HG AS (aortic valve mean gradient [MG] >40 mm Hg), (2) C-LFLG AS (MG <40 mm Hg, stroke volume index <35 ml/m2, left ventricular ejection fraction <50%), and (3) NFLG AS (MG <40 mm Hg, stroke volume index ≥35 ml/m2, left ventricular ejection fraction ≥50%). Logistic regression was used for predictors of C-LFLG AS. Cox regression was used for predictors of mortality in the C-LFLG AS population. Male gender, multiple co-morbidities, and moderate to severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation correlated with the C-LFLG AS group. Patients with C-LFLG AS had a higher mortality risk compared with patients with HG AS at 2 years after TAVR. Patients with NFLG AS had similar mortality at 1 year, but higher mortality at 2 years after TAVR compared with patients with HG AS. End-stage renal disease, atrial fibrillation, and other co-morbidities were predictors of 2-year mortality in patients with C-LFLG AS. In conclusion, the mortality rate after TAVR was higher among patients with C-LFLG AS than those with HG AS. Male gender and multiple co-morbidities were predictors of C-LFLG AS. Multiple co-morbidities were predictors of mortality among those patients.","['Besir Besir', 'Shivabalan Kathavarayan Ramu', 'Maryam Muhammad Ali Majeed-Saidan', 'Judah Rajendran', 'Odette Iskandar', 'Grant Reed', 'Rishi Puri', 'James Yun', 'Serge Harb', 'Rhonda Miyasaka', 'Amar Krishnaswamy', 'Zoran Popovic', 'Samir R Kapadia']",The American journal of cardiology,2025-05-01,10.1016/j.amjcard.2025.01.019,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjcard.2025.01.019,,Paid,Outcomes and Predictors of Different Flow Gradient Patterns of Aortic Stenosis After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement BESIR 2025,Not available,"['Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Aortic Stenosis', 'Aortic Valve', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'C-LFLG', 'Valve Replacement', 'Aortic', 'Patients', 'mortality']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['aortic stenosis', 'classical low-flow low-gradient (C-LFLG) AS', 'high-gradient (HG) AS', 'normal-flow low-gradient (NFLG) AS', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR)']"

39710301,Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Aortic Stenosis Patients With New York Heart Association Functional Class III or IV.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with symptomatic aortic stenosis are a vulnerable population with associated cardiac damage and a significant comorbidity burden. In this study we aimed to determine the rate, factors associated with, and prognostic value of poor functional status (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class III-IV) in patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
METHODS: This multicenter study included 6363 transarterial TAVR patients, classified according to baseline functional status (NYHA class I or II vs III or IV).
RESULTS: A total of 3800 (60%) patients presented with NYHA class III or IV before the TAVR procedure. Atrial fibrillation (odds ratio [OR], 1.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-1.58; P = 0.002), chronic kidney disease (CKD; OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.45-2.05; P < 0.001), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; OR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.32-2.05; P < 0.001), reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (OR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.70-3.05; P < 0.001), and moderate and severe pulmonary hypertension were associated with a poor functional status. At 1-year follow-up, patients with NYHA class III or IV had higher rates of mortality (8.81 per 100 person-years [95% CI, 7.57-10.15] vs 13.12 per 100 person-years [95% CI, 11.80-14.58]; log rank, P < 0.001) and heart failure hospitalization (8.25 per 100 person-years [95% CI, 7.05-9.65] vs 12.5 per 100 person-years [95% CI, 11.24-14.00]; log rank, P = 0.005). Comorbidity factors (COPD, CKD) and signs of cardiac damage (atrial fibrillation, pulmonary hypertension) determined an increased risk of poorer clinical outcomes (P < 0.01 for all).
CONCLUSIONS: More than half of the patients undergoing TAVR in the contemporary era have presented with advanced functional class before the procedure, and this was associated with a greater comorbidity and cardiac damage burden. Patients with poorer baseline functional status exhibited worse clinical outcomes at 1-year follow-up. These findings highlight the need for further study on earlier interventions for patients with aortic stenosis.","['Jorge Nuche', 'Jules Mesnier', 'Julien Ternacle', 'Effat Rezaei', 'Francisco Campelo-Parada', 'Marina Urena', 'Gabriela Veiga-Fernandez', 'Luis Nombela-Franco', 'Anna Franzone', 'Antonio J Munoz-Garcia', 'Victoria Vilalta', 'Ander Regueiro', 'David Del Val', 'Lluis Asmarats', 'Maria Del Trigo', 'Vicenç Serra', 'Guillaume Bonnet', 'Melchior Jonveaux', 'Ronan Canitrot', 'Dominique Himbert', 'Jose Maria de la Torre Hernandez', 'Gabriela Tirado-Conte', 'Eduard Fernandez-Nofrerias', 'Pedro Cepas', 'Fernando Alfonso', 'Lola Gutierrez-Alonso', 'Juan Francisco Oteo', 'Yassin Belahnech', 'Siamak Mohammadi', 'Thomas Modine', 'Marisa Avvedimento', 'Josep Rodés-Cabau', 'Asim N Cheema']",The Canadian journal of cardiology,2025-05-12,10.1016/j.cjca.2024.12.025,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2024.12.025,,Paid,Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Aortic Stenosis Patients With New York Heart Association Functional Class III or IV NUCHE 2025,Not available,"['York Heart Association', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'NYHA class III', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Aortic Stenosis', 'Heart Association Functional', 'York Heart', 'Heart Association', 'Association Functional Class', 'Class III']",2025-05-12,Pending,[]
39667494,Clinical Outcomes in Atrial Fibrillation Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement With Contemporary Devices.,"BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) has been identified as a marker of advanced cardiac damage in patients with aortic stenosis. However, the factors associated with poorer outcomes among AF patients in contemporary transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) practice, particularly regarding mortality and heart failure (HF)-related hospitalizations, remain largely unknown.
METHODS: In this multicenter study, we assessed consecutive patients with a history of AF and evaluated the clinical outcomes of those who underwent TAVR with newer generation devices using either balloon- or self-expandable valves.
RESULTS: A total of 3476 patients were included in the study. After a median follow-up of 2 (interquartile range, 1-4) years, 36.1% patients had died, with 51.5% of deaths being cardiovascular-related, including 15.6% from HF. HF-related hospitalizations post-TAVR accounted for 34.8% of all hospitalizations and were associated with a higher mortality risk (hazard ratio [HR], 1.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.32-1.81; P < 0.001). Permanent AF was identified as an independent predictor of all-cause mortality or HF-related hospitalizations (HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.10-1.40; P < 0.001), as did other baseline characteristics, including chronic kidney disease (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.09-1.38; P = 0.001), anemia (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.07-1.36; P = 0.002), and New York Heart Association functional class III or IV (HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.01-1.27; P = 0.045). In addition, early postprocedural complications, including stroke and bleeding, also significantly increased the risk of mortality (HR, 5.52; 95% CI, 3.12-9.79; P < 0.001) and HF-related hospitalizations (HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.03-1.33; P = 0.014).
CONCLUSIONS: AF patients exhibited a high risk of mortality and HF-related hospitalizations in a contemporary TAVR cohort. Several baseline comorbidities and periprocedural complications, along with permanent (vs paroxysmal) AF, were associated with poorer outcomes. These findings confirm the negative impact of AF despite the continued improvements in TAVR technology and underscore the importance of early intervention and optimization of HF management to improve outcomes in this high-risk population.","['Siddhartha Mengi', 'Pedro Cepas-Guillén', 'Julien Ternacle', 'Marina Urena', 'Alberto Alperi', 'Asim N Cheema', 'Gabriela Veiga-Fernandez', 'Luis Nombela-Franco', 'Victoria Vilalta', 'Giovanni Esposito', 'Francisco Campelo-Parada', 'Ciro Indolfi', 'Maria Del Trigo', 'Antonio Muñoz-Garcia', 'Nicolas Maneiro', 'Lluís Asmarats', 'Ander Regueiro', 'David Del Val', 'Vicenç Serra', 'Vincent Auffret', 'Lionel Leroux', 'Thomas Modine', 'Jules Mesnier', 'Gaspard Suc', 'Pablo Avanzas', 'Effat Rezaei', 'Victor Fradejas-Sastre', 'Gabriela Tirado-Conte', 'Eduard Fernández-Nofrerias', 'Domenico Angellotti', 'Thibaut Guitteny', 'Sabato Sorrentino', 'Juan Francisco Oteo', 'Felipe Díez-Delhoyo', 'Lola Gutiérrez-Alonso', 'Pablo Vidal-Calés', 'Fernando Alfonso', 'Andrea Monastyrski', 'Maxime Nolf', 'Marisa Avvedimento', 'Josep Rodés-Cabau']",The Canadian journal of cardiology,2025-05-12,10.1016/j.cjca.2024.12.007,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2024.12.007,,Paid,Clinical Outcomes in Atrial Fibrillation Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement With Contemporary Devices MENGI 2025,Not available,"['Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic', 'Fibrillation Patients Undergoing', 'Patients Undergoing Transcatheter', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Atrial Fibrillation Patients', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Undergoing Transcatheter', 'contemporary transcatheter aortic', 'Patients Undergoing']",2025-05-12,Pending,[]
39667492,Four-dimensional Cardiac Modelling of Multiphase Computed Tomography for Predicting Outcomes After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.,"BACKGROUND: Multiphase computed tomography angiography (mpCTA) is routinely performed prior to transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) to determine eligibility and enable preprocedural planning. Incremental prognostic value may be realized from full-cycle, multiphase reconstructions to assess the contractile health of the cardiac chambers. In this study we assessed the feasibility of 4-dimensional chamber modelling of the left ventricle (LV) to support 3-dimensional minimum principal strain (3DminPS)-based predictions of clinical outcomes after TAVR.
METHODS: Two hundred five patients undergoing pre-TAVR mpCTA were studied. UNet-based 3D chamber segmentation was followed by mesh modelling and 3D feature tracking-based deformation to determine global 3DminPS for endocardial, epicardial, and transmural layers. Independent associations of 3DminPS with the primary outcome of heart failure hospitalization or death are described.
RESULTS: Of the 205 patients studied, 196 (96%) had analyzable mpCTAs (median age, 85 years; 55% male; Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality score = 3.10; 60.0% echocardiographic LV ejection fraction). At a median of 25 months after TAVR, 55 patients (28%) experienced the primary outcome. After adjustment for baseline variables, patients with an endocardial 3DminPS amplitude worse than -23.7% experienced a 2.7-fold higher risk of the outcome (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-5.1; P = 0.001), with this high-risk cohort having 1- and 3-year event rates of 32% and 49%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Four-dimensional chamber modelling of mpCTA using UNet-based segmentation and standardized mesh deformation is feasible and enables delivery of 3D deformation markers with strong prognostic value for the prediction of outcomes after TAVR. Prospective validation in a multicentre setting is currently being undertaken.","['Mohamad Rabbani', 'Ali Fatehi Hassanabad', 'Alessandro Satriano', 'Dina Labib', 'Carmen P Lydell', 'Michael Bristow', 'Anna Bizios', 'Corey Adams', 'Muhammad Mustafa Alhussein', 'Steven Dykstra', 'Jacqueline Flewitt', 'Sandra Rivest', 'William Kent', 'Zhiying Liang', 'Tianqi Tao', 'Andrew G Howarth', 'Elena Di Martino', 'Nowell M Fine', 'Michael W A Chu', 'James A White']",The Canadian journal of cardiology,2025-05-12,10.1016/j.cjca.2024.12.008,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2024.12.008,,Paid,Four dimensional Cardiac Modelling of Multiphase Computed Tomography for Predicting Outcomes After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement RABBANI 2025,Not available,"['Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Multiphase Computed Tomography', 'Valve Replacement', 'computed tomography angiography', 'Aortic Valve', 'Computed Tomography', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'Multiphase Computed', 'Predicting Outcomes']",2025-05-12,Pending,[]
39667491,Clinical Outcomes of Patients With Bicuspid Aortic Valve Undergoing a Targeted Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Approach: The LIRA Method.,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in patients with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) disease is still burdened by a non-negligible rate of stroke and permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI). These suboptimal results, possibly related to the unique BAV anatomy, may suggest the use of a different sizing method in this setting. The aim of our study is to evaluate whether the application of the supra-annular LIRA method may improve clinical outcomes in this population.
METHODS: In this single-center retrospective study, we enrolled consecutive patients with severe aortic stenosis and raphe-type BAV undergone TAVR with the implantation of supra-annular self-expanding prostheses sized according to the LIRA method. The primary endpoint was the device success. Secondary endpoints were in-hospital and 30-day safety outcomes and 1-year clinical efficacy. All study endpoints were adjudicated according to the Valve Academic Research Consortium 3 criteria.
RESULTS: A total of 104 patients (mean age, 79.8 ± 5.83 years) were enrolled in our study. The mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons score was 4.96 ± 4.73%. Use of the LIRA method led to prosthesis downsizing in 85.6% of patients. Device success was 94.2%. All-cause death was 0%, conversion to surgery was 0%, and an extremely low rate of stroke (1.9%) and PPI (9.6%) was observed. The intended performance of the valve was attained in 96.1% of patients and it was maintained at 1-year follow-up. Clinical efficacy at 1 year was reached in 90.6% of patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The LIRA method represents an alternative option for prosthesis sizing in patients with type 1 and type 2 BAV undergoing TAVR with promising early and midterm outcomes.","['Barbara Bellini', 'Vittorio Romano', 'Greca Zanda', 'Gianmarco Iannopollo', 'Tommaso De Ferrari', 'Eva Bijlsma', 'Francesca Napoli', 'Ciro Vella', 'Domitilla Gentile', 'Giulia Ghizzoni', 'Luca Angelo Ferri', 'Filippo Russo', 'Marco Bruno Ancona', 'Francesco Ancona', 'Eustachio Agricola', 'Anna Palmisano', 'Antonio Esposito', 'Matteo Montorfano']",The Canadian journal of cardiology,2025-05-12,10.1016/j.cjca.2024.12.006,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2024.12.006,,Paid,Clinical Outcomes of Patients With Bicuspid Aortic Valve Undergoing a Targeted Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Approach The LIRA Method BELLINI 2025,Not available,"['Targeted Transcatheter Aortic', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Valve Replacement Approach', 'Bicuspid Aortic Valve', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Targeted Transcatheter', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'Aortic Valve', 'Replacement Approach', 'LIRA Method']",2025-05-12,Pending,[]
39442866,Durability of right ventricular conduits in the Ross procedure.,"BACKGROUND: Right ventricular (RV) conduit availability and degeneration are potential limitations of the Ross procedure. Pulmonary homografts are the gold standard, but their limited availability drives the need for alternatives. The aim of this study was to compare results of different RV conduits.
METHODS: Between 1995 and 2023, 315 consecutive patients (73% males; mean age, 37 ± 12 years) underwent a Ross procedure using a homograft (n = 211), bovine jugular vein (BJV) (n = 34), or xenograft (n = 70) as the RV conduit. The mean follow-up was 5.7 ± 6.7 years and was 96% complete (1631 patient-years).
RESULTS: Twelve patients (homograft, n = 8; BJV. n = 3; xenograft, n = 1) required RV conduit reintervention, including 4 patients within 4 years (all with homografts). Indications for reintervention were degeneration in 8 patients and active endocarditis in 4 patients. Reinterventions included RV conduit replacement (homograft, n = 3; xenograft, n = 1; BJV, n = 2) and transcatheter valve implantation (homograft n = 5; BJV, n = 1). At 15 years, freedom from RV conduit reintervention was 88%, and freedom from reoperation was 93%. Freedom from reintervention at 15 years was similar in the homograft (89%), BJV (89%), and xenograft (100%) groups (P = .812). Progression of mean RV conduit gradient was lowest for the BJV group (1.45 mm Hg/year) and similar in the homograft (2.6 mm Hg/year) and xenograft (2.9 mm Hg/year) groups. Age at <18 years at surgery (hazard ratio [HR], 1.9; P < .001) was a predictive risk factor for reintervention. There was no difference among the RV conduit groups (HR, 1.198; P = .606).
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of reintervention after 15 years is similar in recipients of homografts, xenografts, and BJV grafts. Interestingly, homografts may fail in the first few years, possibly related to inflammatory phenomena. Thus, the use of xenografts may be an option if homografts are not available.","['Karen B Abeln', 'Lennart Froede', 'Christian Giebels', 'Hans-Joachim Schäfers']",The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,2025-05-12,10.1016/j.jtcvs.2024.10.023,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcvs.2024.10.023,,Paid,Durability of right ventricular conduits in the Ross procedure ABELN 2025,Not available,"['Ross procedure', 'Ross', 'BJV', 'conduit', 'years', 'reintervention', 'homograft', 'homografts', 'xenograft', 'procedure']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Ross procedure', 'homograft', 'right ventricular conduit']"
39343570,Association between the Mean Platelet Volume and Prosthesis-patient Mismatch after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.,"Objective The mean platelet volume (MPV), a marker of platelet activity, is significantly higher in patients with aortic stenosis (AS) than in those without AS. The association between the platelet function and prosthesis-patient mismatch (PPM) after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) remains unknown. Therefore, we investigated this association by measuring the MPV. Methods Of 237 patients who underwent TAVR, 148 with a median age of 84 years old were enrolled in this study. Blood tests and transthoracic echocardiography were performed at baseline and approximately six months after TAVR. PPM was defined as an aortic valve area index ≤0.85 cm2/m2 after TAVR. Variable changes from baseline to six-month follow-up were compared between patients with and without PPM. Results Forty-five patients (30%) developed PPM. The MPV was significantly higher in patients with PPM than in those without PPM. However, regarding the magnitude of change, the MPV was significantly less reduced in patients with PPM, and the percentage of patients with reduced MPV was lower in patients with PPM than in those without PPM. A logistic regression analysis revealed that a higher MPV and lack of MPV reduction at the six-month follow-up were independent predictors of PPM. Conclusion MPV values at the six-month follow-up were associated with PPM after TAVR in patients with AS. MPV values increase when PPM is present after TAVR and may be an indicator during the postoperative follow-up.","['Yuichi Morita', 'Hiroki Ikenaga', 'Atsushi Takeda', 'Takayuki Nakano', 'Tasuku Higashihara', 'Noriaki Watanabe', 'Yoshiharu Sada', 'Hiroto Utsunomiya', 'Shinya Takahashi', 'Yukihiro Fukuda', 'Yukiko Nakano']","Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",2025-04-15,10.2169/internalmedicine.4205-24,https://doi.org/10.2169/internalmedicine.4205-24,,Paid,Association between the Mean Platelet Volume and Prosthesis patient Mismatch after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement MORITA 2025,Not available,"['Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'PPM', 'Platelet Volume', 'MPV', 'Aortic Valve', 'Prosthesis-patient Mismatch', 'Valve Replacement', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'TAVR']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['aortic stenosis', 'mean platelet volume', 'prosthesis-patient mismatch', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"
38936601,Five-year outcomes of transcarotid transcatheter aortic valve replacement.,"BACKGROUND: Transcarotid transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TC-TAVR) has emerged as an alternative access route for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). However, scarce data exist on long-term outcomes following TC-TAVR. This study aimed to evaluate clinical outcomes at 5 years after TC-TAVR.
METHODS: A total of 110 consecutive patients who underwent TC-TAVR were included. Baseline, procedural, and follow-up data were collected prospectively in a dedicated database. The primary endpoint was the incidence of a composite outcome of all-cause mortality, stroke, and repeat hospitalization at 5-year follow-up. Echocardiography results, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, and quality of life (QoL) as assessed with the EuroQol visual analog scale (EQ-VAS) were examined over the 5-year follow-up.
RESULTS: The median patient age was 77 years (interquartile range [IQR], 72-82.2 years), 42.3% were women, and the median Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) risk score was 5.02% (IQR, 3.4%-7.5%). The incidence of the composite primary endpoint was 54.5%. Death from any cause occurred in 45.6% of patients (11.9 per 100 patient-years); stroke in 8.2% (1.9 per 100 patient-years); disabling stroke in 2.7% (0.7 per 100 patient-years); and rehospitalization in 27.2%. The improvements in valve hemodynamics, NYHA class, and EQ-VAS following the procedure persisted at 5-year follow-up (P < .001). The incidence of bioprosthetic valve failure was 0.9%.
CONCLUSIONS: About half of the moderate-to high-risk patients undergoing TC-TAVR survived with no major cardiovascular events at the 5-year follow-up. The yearly incidence of stroke events was low, and early improvements in valve hemodynamics, functional status, and QoL persisted at 5 years. These results suggest the long-term safety and efficacy of TC-TAVR and would support this approach as an alternative to surgery in non-transfemoral candidates.","['Juan Hernando Del Portillo', 'Dimitri Kalavrouziotis', 'Eric Dumont', 'Jean-Michel Paradis', 'Anthony Poulin', 'Frederic Beaupré', 'Marisa Avvedimento', 'Silvia Mas-Peiro', 'Pedro Cepas-Guillén', 'Siddhartha Mengi', 'Siamak Mohammadi', 'Josep Rodés-Cabau']",The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,2025-05-12,10.1016/j.jtcvs.2024.06.017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcvs.2024.06.017,,Paid,Five year outcomes of transcarotid transcatheter aortic valve replacement PORTILLO 2025,Not available,"['transcarotid transcatheter aortic', 'aortic valve replacement', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'transcatheter aortic', 'transcarotid transcatheter', 'valve replacement', 'aortic valve', 'replacement', 'aortic', 'transcatheter']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['aortic valve', 'long-term', 'transcarotid', 'transcatheter valve replacement']"
38815806,Machine-learning approaches for risk prediction in transcatheter aortic valve implantation: Systematic review and meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVES: With the expanding integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) into the structural heart domain, numerous ML models have emerged for the prediction of adverse outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). We aim to identify, describe, and critically appraise ML prediction models for adverse outcomes after TAVI. Key objectives consisted in summarizing model performance, evaluating adherence to reporting guidelines, and transparency.
METHODS: We searched PubMed, SCOPUS, and Embase through August 2023. We selected published machine learning models predicting TAVI outcomes. Two reviewers independently screened articles, extracted data, and assessed the study quality according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Outcomes included summary C-statistics and model risk of bias assessed with the Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. C-statistics were pooled using a random-effects model.
RESULTS: Twenty-one studies (118,153 patients) employing various ML algorithms (76 models) were included in the systematic review. Predictive ability of models varied: 11.8% inadequate (C-statistic <0.60), 26.3% adequate (C-statistic 0.60-0.70), 31.6% acceptable (C-statistic 0.70-0.80), and 30.3% demonstrated excellent (C-statistic >0.80) performance. Meta-analyses revealed excellent predictive performance for early mortality (C-statistic: 0.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65-0.91), acceptable performance for 1-year mortality (C-statistic: 0.76; 95% CI, 0.67-0.84), and acceptable performance for predicting permanent pacemaker implantation (C-statistic: 0.75; 95% CI, 0.51-0.90).
CONCLUSIONS: ML models for TAVI outcomes exhibit adequate-to-excellent performance, suggesting potential clinical utility. We identified concerns in methodology and transparency, emphasizing the need for improved scientific reporting standards.","['Xander Jacquemyn', 'Emanuel Van Onsem', 'Keith Dufendach', 'James A Brown', 'Dustin Kliner', 'Catalin Toma', 'Derek Serna-Gallegos', 'Michel Pompeu Sá', 'Ibrahim Sultan']",The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,2025-05-12,10.1016/j.jtcvs.2024.05.017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcvs.2024.05.017,,Paid,Machine learning approaches for risk prediction in transcatheter aortic valve implantation Systematic review and meta analysis JACQUEMYN 2025,Not available,"['aortic valve implantation', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'valve implantation', 'aortic valve', 'transcatheter aortic', 'Machine-learning approaches', 'C-statistic', 'TAVI', 'TAVI outcomes', 'prediction']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['aortic valve', 'artificial intelligence', 'machine learning', 'meta-analysis', 'transcatheter aortic valve implantation']"
40353875,Evidence of bioprosthetic valve dysfunction during three-year follow-up following TAVR.,"OBJECTIVE: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has increased significantly in younger patients and patients at lower surgical risk. In this retrospective multicenter study, we aimed to assess for bioprosthetic valve dysfunction (BVD) during three-year follow-up (FU) and potential differences between self-expandable (SEV) and balloon-expandable valves (BEV) under real-world conditions.
METHODS: Endpoints were defined according to VARC-3 criteria, including VARC composite endpoints during three-year FU.
RESULTS: A total of 1233 patients with tricuspid aortic valve stenosis, who underwent TAVR with contemporary transcatheter heart valve (THV) devices from three different tertiary care centers were included. One-fifth of the study population showed BVD at three-year FU (BVD[-]: n = 957;77.6%; BVD[+]: n = 276;22.4%). Non-structural valve deterioration (NSVD) was the most represented category (8.5%) followed by structural valve deterioration (SVD, 5.3%). BVD was more common in association with BEV as compared with SEV (60.9% vs 39.1%; p < 0.001) owing to higher rates of SVD (13.5% vs 9.5%; p = 0.028) and NSVD (17.9% vs. 13.8%; p = 0.048). Subclinical leaflet thrombosis was only documented in BEV (1.7%, p < 0.001). At three years, all-cause mortality was higher in BVD+ patients (BVD[-] vs. BVD[+]: 13.2% vs. 22.5%; HR: 1.99; 95%-CI: 1.39-2.85; p < 0.001*) but did not differ between THV platform.
CONCLUSION: BVD after TAVR is common and associated with higher all-cause mortality. Despite a preponderance of BVD in association with balloon-expandable valves, mortality rates remain similar between THV platforms.

40353871,Predictive performance of the TRI-SCORE in patients with severe aortic stenosis and concomitant tricuspid regurgitation undergoing TAVR.,"BACKGROUND: Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is a common comorbidity in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and represents a significant predictor of adverse outcomes. Precise risk stratification through clinical scoring systems is vital for tailoring treatment decisions in this patient population.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the applicability of the TRI-SCORE for predicting adverse outcomes in patients with AS and concomitant moderate-to-severe TR undergoing TAVR and to compare its performance with established surgical risk scores like the EuroSCORE II and Society of Thoracic Surgeons score (STS-Score).
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 301 patients with severe AS and concomitant TR who underwent TAVR between 2013 and 2022 at the Heart Center Bonn. According to the TRI-SCORE, patients were stratified into a low or intermediate-risk group (TRI-SCORE 0-5) and a high-risk group (TRI-SCORE 6-12). The primary endpoint was 2-year all-cause mortality. Predictive values of the TRI-SCORE were compared to the EuroSCORE II and the STS-Score for both 30-day and 2-year mortality outcomes.
RESULTS: The 2-year mortality rate was significantly higher in the high-risk group compared to the low or intermediate-risk group (TRI-SCORE 6-12: 40.0% vs. TRI-SCORE 0-5: 17.9%; p < 0.001). For predicting 30-day mortality, the EuroSCORE II and the STS-Score demonstrated superior predictive values, with AUCs of 78.4% and 83.0%, respectively, in comparison to the TRI-SCORE, which showed an AUC of 70.0%. Conversely, the TRI-SCORE allowed a better risk prediction with regard to 2-year all-cause mortality, achieving an AUC of 69.7%, superior to the EuroSCORE II (60.6%) and the STS-Score (62.1%).
CONCLUSION: The TRI-SCORE is effective in predicting mid-term mortality in patients with AS and moderate-to-severe TR undergoing TAVR, demonstrating greater robustness than the EuroSCORE II and the STS-Score for this timeframe.","['Mustafa Mousa Basha', 'Baravan Al-Kassou', 'Christopher Gestrich', 'Marcel Weber', 'Thomas Beiert', 'Sebastian Zimmer', 'Farhad Bakhtiary', 'Georg Nickenig', 'Jasmin Shamekhi']",Clinical research in cardiology : official journal of the German Cardiac Society,2025-05-12,10.1007/s00392-025-02671-y,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00392-025-02671-y,PMC5698373,Free,Predictive performance of the TRI SCORE in patients with severe aortic stenosis and concomitant tricuspid regurgitation undergoing TAVR BASHA 2025,pdfs\Predictive performance of the TRI SCORE in patients with severe aortic stenosis and concomitant tricuspid regurgitation undergoing TAVR BASH.pdf,"['patients', 'patients undergoing TAVI', 'TAVI', 'TRV', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'aortic valve', 'mortality', 'aortic valve implantation', 'all-cause mortality', 'undergoing TAVR']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Aortic valve stenosis', 'EuroSCORE II', 'STS-Score', 'TRI-SCORE', 'Transcatheter aortic valve replacement', 'Tricuspid regurgitation']"
40352131,Early Changes in Left Ventricular Myocardial Mechanics After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement for Severe Aortic Stenosis.,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) improves left ventricular (LV) deformation by aortic stenosis (AS). However, the early effects of TAVR on LV mechanics as assessed by echocardiography have not been fully elucidated.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Between 2021 and 2024, we included 81 patients who underwent transfemoral TAVR for severe AS. We used the natural logarithm of B-type natriuretic peptide (lnBNP) 1 week after TAVR as an indicator of the early effects on LV mechanics. To determine the association with echocardiographic parameters (LV ejection fraction [LVEF], global longitudinal strain [GLS], E/e', and Tei index) and postprocedural lnBNP, we used regression models while adjusting for covariates. There were no significant differences in LVEF, GLS or E/e' between before and after TAVR, but the postprocedural Tei index was significantly higher than the preprocedural Tei index (0.40 vs. 0.26, P<0.01). In a univariate linear regression, the preprocedural LVEF (β=-0.28, P=0.01), GLS (β=-0.24, P=0.04), E/e' (β=0.36, P<0.01), and Tei index (β=0.27, P=0.02) correlated with postprocedural lnBNP. Regarding the postprocedural parameters, GLS (β=-0.27, P=0.02) and E/e' (β=0.36, P<0.01) also correlated with postprocedural lnBNP, but the LVEF and Tei index did not. After adjustment for covariates, these correlations remained significant.
CONCLUSIONS: Preprocedural echocardiographic parameters reflecting LV function correlated with BNP after TAVR, but the utility of postprocedural parameters may depend on preprocedural LV function or perioperative factors.","['Takeru Ikenaga', 'Yuta Kato', 'Yuto Kawahira', 'Midori Miyazaki', 'Tetsuo Hirata', 'Hiromitsu Teratani', 'Go Kuwahara', 'Makoto Sugihara', 'Hideichi Wada', 'Masahiro Ogawa', 'Shin-Ichiro Miura']",Circulation reports,2025-05-09,10.1253/circrep.CR-24-0139,https://doi.org/10.1253/circrep.CR-24-0139,PMC12061501,Free,Early Changes in Left Ventricular Myocardial Mechanics After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement for Severe Aortic Stenosis IKENAGA 2025,pdfs\Early Changes in Left Ventricular Myocardial Mechanics After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement for Severe Aortic Stenosis IKENAGA 2025..pdf,"['Tei index', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'TAVR', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Tei', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'Severe Aortic Stenosis', 'postprocedural Tei index', 'preprocedural Tei index', 'Aortic Valve']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Aortic stenosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Tei index', 'Transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"

Moreover, the rate of strokes, particularly disabling strokes, has not diminished over time despite improvements in pre-procedural planning and implantation techniques. The mechanisms of stroke in TAVI patients are complex, and identifying consistent risk factors is challenging due to evolving patient profiles, varied study cohorts, and continuous device modifications. Multiple pharmacological and mechanical treatment strategies have been developed to mitigate the risk of stroke, particularly as TAVI expands toward younger populations.

40351685,Age Differences in Aortic Stenosis.,"Aortic stenosis (AS) is a significant and growing concern, with a prevalence of 2-3% in individuals aged over 65 years. Moreover, with an aging global population, the prevalence is anticipated to double by 2050. Indeed, AS can arise from various etiologies, including calcific trileaflets, congenital valve abnormalities (e.g., bicuspid and unicuspid valves), and post-rheumatic, whereby each has a distinct influence that shapes the onset and progression of the disease. The normal aortic valve has a trilaminar structure comprising the fibrosa, spongiosa, and ventricularis, which work together to maintain its function. In calcific AS, the disease begins with early calcification starting in high mechanical stress areas of the valve and progresses slowly over decades, eventually leading to extensive calcification resulting in impaired valve function. This process involves mechanisms similar to atherosclerosis, including lipid deposition, chronic inflammation, and mineralization. The progression of calcific AS is strongly associated with aging, with additional risk factors including male gender, smoking, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome exacerbating the condition. Conversely, congenital forms of AS, such as bicuspid and unicuspid aortic valves, result in an earlier disease onset, typically 10-20 years earlier than that observed in patients with a normal tricuspid aortic valve. Rheumatic AS, although less common in developed countries due to effective antibiotic treatments, also exhibits age-related characteristics, with an earlier onset in individuals who experienced rheumatic fever in their youth. The only curative therapies currently available are surgical and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). However, these options are sometimes too invasive for older patients; thus, management of AS, particularly in older patients, requires a comprehensive approach that considers age, disease severity, comorbidities, frailty, and each patient's individual needs. Although the valves used in TAVR demonstrate promising midterm durability, long-term data are still required, especially when used in younger individuals, usually with low surgical risk. Moreover, understanding the causes and mechanisms of structural valve deterioration is crucial for appropriate treatment selections, including valve selection and pharmacological therapy, since this knowledge is essential for optimizing the lifelong management of AS.","['Tomoyo Hamana', 'Teruo Sekimoto', 'Aloke V Finn', 'Renu Virmani']",Reviews in cardiovascular medicine,2025-04-12,10.31083/RCM28185,https://doi.org/10.31083/RCM28185,PMC12059746,Free,Age Differences in Aortic Stenosis HAMANA 2025,pdfs\Age Differences in Aortic Stenosis HAMANA 2025.pdf,"['aortic valve', 'Aortic', 'normal aortic valve', 'valve', 'Aortic Stenosis', 'tricuspid aortic valve', 'aortic valve disease', 'normal tricuspid aortic', 'calcific aortic valve', 'aortic valve leaflets']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['aortic stenosis', 'bioprosthetic valve failure', 'calcific aortic valve disease']"

Motivated by in vitro fracture experiments and the first successful clinical implantation of a transcatheter valve (TAVR) into the remaining ring in aortic position, this approach was considered for the mitral position for the first time.
CASE SUMMARY: A 31-year-old female patient with a history of four open-heart surgeries and severe neurologic complications presented with cardiac decompensation due to a fixed tilt of her mechanical bileaflet mitral valve prosthesis, resulting in mitral stenosis with a mean gradient of above 10 mmHg. An interventional approach was discussed. Using an apical access, the tilts were cracked under cerebral protection, and a balloon-implantable TAVR was implanted uneventfully. More than 3 years later, the patient is clinically stable, the valvular function is not impaired and the embolized fragment does not cause any problems in the distal abdominal aorta.
DISCUSSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report that demonstrates the possibility to implant a biological TAVR in a failed bileaflet mechanical mitral valve after fracturing the carbon tilts.","['Christian Butter', 'Michael Neuss', 'Tanja Kücken', 'Doreen Bensch', 'Michael Erb']",European heart journal.

40349944,Explantation of Transcatheter Aortic Bioprostheses in a Very High-Risk Population.,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement explantation is associated with excessive rates of mortality. We describe a high-risk cohort of patients who underwent surgical explant with excellent outcomes at our institution.
METHODS: This is a single center, retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent surgical removal of a transcatheter bioprosthesis between January 2015 and April 2023. Clinical and operative characteristics were reviewed by direct chart review and survival was estimated.
RESULTS: Thirty-three patients underwent device explantation. Mean age was 75 ± 5.9 years. STS-PROM was 7.34 at surgical explant. Eighteen patients (55%) had previous cardiac surgery, with 15 secondary and 3 tertiary sternotomoies. Fourteen patients had prior ViV TAVR. Indications for explantation were prosthetic valve degeneration (46%), endocarditis (33%), paravalvular leak (15%), and ventricular septal defect (6%). Median TAVR valve age was 815 days. Twenty-two patients required a concomitant operation including: mitral valve replacement (21%), aortic operation (9%), coronary bypass grafting (18%), myectomy (6%), and atrial or ventricular septal defect repair (12%). None required aortic root replacement. Mean hospital length of stay was 10 ± 8 days. Postoperative complications included new renal failure (6%), respiratory failure (12%), pacemaker implantation (3%), and reentry for bleeding (3%). No patient suffered a stroke. Thirty-day, 1-year, and 3-year mortality rates were 6%, 18.6%, and 38.4%.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that acceptable outcomes are attainable in a high-risk patient cohort undergoing TAVR explant.

This study aimed to identify risk factors and develop predictive models for post-operative MR following TAVR using machine learning (ML) techniques to enhance early detection and intervention.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from patients who underwent TAVR at our center between August 2014 and August 2023. Patients were classified into post-operative and nonpost-operative MR groups based on postprocedural MR severity. Various ML models were evaluated for predictive performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) values were used to interpret predictive patterns and develop a clinically relevant model.
RESULTS: Among the evaluated models, the random forest model exhibited the highest predictive performance for post-operative moderate-to-severe MR after TAVR. Key predictors, which were confirmed by the SHAP analysis as important in the predictive framework, included echocardiographic parameters, blood test results, patient age, and body mass index.
CONCLUSIONS: ML models show promise in predicting post-operative moderate-to-severe MR after TAVR by integrating clinical indicators to enhance predictive accuracy.

This study aimed to compare the safety and efficacy of TAVR in these patient groups.
METHODS: Using data from the Chinese Cardiovascular Association Database-National Transcatheter Valve Therapeutics Registry, we analysed 870 propensity score matched pairs of patients with severe calcification (≥470 mm³) undergoing TAVR between April 2014 and August 2023. Primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 1 year.
RESULTS: No significant differences were observed in technical success (95.1% vs 94.7%), procedural complications or in-hospital outcomes. All-cause mortality at 1 year was similar between bicuspid and tricuspid AS (4.3% vs 5.3%, HR 0.87; log-rank p=0.62). The incidence of stroke (1.5% vs 1.4%), cardiovascular hospitalisation (1.4% vs 1.7%) and moderate-to-severe paravalvular leak (3.5% vs 2.5%) was similar during follow-up. The rate of new permanent pacemaker implantation was higher in bicuspid AS (8.4% vs 5.6%; p=0.03).

We aimed to investigate the incidence, predictors and clinical outcomes of late upper GI bleeding in patients undergoing TAVR.
METHODS: In a prospective TAVR registry, patients were stratified according to upper GI bleeding within 1 year of discharge.
RESULTS: Among the 3144 eligible patients, 54 (1.7%) experienced upper GI bleeding after discharge. Of these, 40 patients had major or life-threatening bleeding, while 14 had minor bleeding events. The presence of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter (HRadjusted 2.98; 95% CI 1.65 to 5.38) and previous upper GI bleeding (HRadjusted 3.51; 95% CI 1.51 to 8.19) were independent predictors of upper GI bleeding, while the use of proton pump inhibitors at discharge (HRadjusted 0.49; 95% CI 0.27 to 0.89) and higher haemoglobin levels (1 g/dL increase) (HRadjusted 0.73; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.87) were protective. Patients who experienced major or life-threatening upper GI bleeding had a higher all-cause (73.7% vs 11.4%, HR 5.84; 95% CI 3.41 to 10.02) and cardiovascular mortality (31.6% vs 7.3%, HR 3.87; 95% CI 1.72 to 8.70) compared with those without upper GI bleeding.
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients who underwent TAVR, 1.7% of patients experienced upper GI bleeding within 1 year of discharge. Major or life-threatening upper GI bleeding was associated with an increased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.

40348046,Comparative Prognostic Value of Risk Factors for Predicting Pacemaker Implantation After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-analysis.,"This study compares the prognostic value of risk factors for Permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI) following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases were searched until November 2024 for studies reporting PPI incidence within 30 days post-TAVR. A random-effect model was used to pool risk ratios (RR) and standardized mean differences (SDM) for binary and continuous risk factors. Network meta-analysis estimated pooled risk differences (ΔRR) for binary predictors with male sex as the reference. Significant predictors were ranked based on their surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) values. A total of 108 studies comprising 77,538 patients (14,560 requiring PPI) were included. Male sex (RR: 1.13), baseline atrial fibrillation (AF) (RR: 1.12), 2nd degree Mobitz I (RR: 5.16) and Mobitz II (RR: 2.30) atrioventricular blocks (AVB), 3rd degree AVB (RR: 13.46), left anterior (LAHB) (RR: 1.79) and posterior hemiblocks (LPHB) (RR: 2.57), bifascicular block (RR: 2.34), right bundle branch block (RBBB) (RR: 3.20) and intraprocedural AVB (RR: 4.15) were identified as predictors for PPI post-TAVR. The risk of PPI was higher with self-expandable valves (RR: 1.79), subclavian access (RR: 1.75), and 29 mm prostheses (RR: 1.33) compared to balloon-expandable valves, transfemoral access, and 23 mm prostheses. Network meta-analysis ranked 3rd degree AVB (SUCRA <0.01), Mobitz I AVB (SUCRA: 0.14), Mobitz II AVB (SUCRA: 0.33), intraprocedural AVB (SUCRA: 0.42), bifascicular block (SUCRA: 0.48), RBBB (SUCRA: 0.49) and LPHB (SUCRA: 0.54) as major predictors of PPI in descending order of significance. In conclusion, clinicians should closely monitor conduction abnormalities as key predictors of PPI following TAVR. Additionally, other risk factors such as subclavian access, self-expanding implantation, AF, large prosthesis diameter, and male sex should not be overlooked.","['Negin Sadat Hosseini Mohammadi', 'Kiarash Tavakoli', 'Morvarid Taebi', 'Ali Zafari', 'Mobina Riahi', 'Mohammad Mahdi Molaei', 'Mashood Ahmad Farooqi', 'Ramtin Khanipour', 'Houshang Bavandpour Karvane', 'Soraya Shahrzad', 'Marmar Vaseghi', 'Ghanunjaya R Lakkirrddy', 'Jishanth Mattumpuram', 'Stylianos Tzeis', 'Yaser Jenab', 'Kaveh Hosseini']",The American journal of cardiology,2025-05-08,10.1016/j.amjcard.2025.05.009,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjcard.2025.05.009,,Paid,Comparative Prognostic Value of Risk Factors for Predicting Pacemaker Implantation After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement A Systematic Review and Network Meta analysis MOHAMMADI 2025,Not available,"['Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Predicting Pacemaker Implantation', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Systematic Review', 'Permanent pacemaker implantation', 'Predicting Pacemaker', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'Valve Replacement', 'SUCRA', 'Aortic Valve']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Artificial', 'Atrioventricular Block', 'Cardiac Conduction Disorders', 'Pacemaker', 'Risk Factors', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement']"
40348045,Impact of Annulus Size on Bioprosthetic Valve Failure after Self-Expanding Transcatheter Heart Valves Replacement.,"There is limited evidence on the prognosis and long-term valve durability after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in patients with small aortic annulus (SAA) and large aortic annulus (LAA). This analysis was sought to evaluate the impact of annular size differences on patients' and valve outcomes. A total of 1,211 patients undergoing TAVR using self-expandable transcatheter heart valve (SE-THV) were retrospectively analyzed. The cut-off for SAA was defined as annulus perimeter of < 72 mm. The primary endpoints were all-cause mortality and bioprosthetic valve failure (BVF) between the SAA and LAA groups. As a sub-analysis, the impact of post-procedural mean pressure gradient (mPG) ≥ 20mmHg and severe prosthesis-patient mismatch (PPM) on these outcomes were also evaluated. Of all patients, 60.1% (n=723) had SAA. At 7 years after TAVR, the SAA group had lower incidence of all-cause mortality (53.7% vs. 63.7%, log-rank p=0.05) and lower event rate of BVF than LAA (1.2% vs. 4.6%, p=0.01 for Gray's test). Multivariate Cox-regression and Fine-Gray competing risk regression analysis demonstrated the presence of SAA was related to better prognosis (Hazard ratio [HR]: 0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.67 to 0.98) and lower BVF (adjusted subdistribution HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.98). There were no impact of post-procedural mPG ≥ 20 mmHg or severe PPM on the difference of mortality and BVF. Further, these results were consistent in the patients with SAAs. In conclusion, SAA had better long-term patients' prognosis and valve durability after TAVR with SE-THV.","['Hirofumi Hioki', 'Masanori Yamamoto', 'Tetsuro Shimura', 'Shinichi Shirai', 'Kenichi Ishizu', 'Yohei Ohno', 'Fumiaki Yashima', 'Toru Naganuma', 'Yusuke Watanabe', 'Futoshi Yamanaka', 'Gaku Nakazawa', 'Masahiko Noguchi', 'Masaki Izumo', 'Masahiko Asami', 'Hidetaka Nishina', 'Yasushi Fuku', 'Toshiaki Otsuka', 'Kentaro Hayashida']",The American journal of cardiology,2025-05-08,10.1016/j.amjcard.2025.05.008,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjcard.2025.05.008,,Paid,Impact of Annulus Size on Bioprosthetic Valve Failure after Self Expanding Transcatheter Heart Valves Replacement HIOKI 2025,Not available,"['Heart Valves Replacement', 'Self-Expanding Transcatheter Heart', 'aortic valve replacement', 'Bioprosthetic Valve Failure', 'Transcatheter Heart Valves', 'Transcatheter Heart', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'Valve', 'SAA', 'Valves Replacement']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Bioprosthetic valve failure', 'Self-expandable transcatheter heart valve', 'Small aortic annulus', 'Transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"
40347211,Cerebral embolic protection in transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI): a pooled analysis of 4091 patients.,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is increasingly used for severe aortic stenosis, but debris embolization during the procedure can lead to strokes, impacting survival and quality of life. The role of cerebral embolic protection devices (CEPDs) in mitigating stroke risk remains debated. We aim to evaluate the impact of CEPDs on the risk of stroke and neurocognitive outcomes after TAVI.
METHODS: Six databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane, Embase, and Ovid) were searched until 20 January 2023. Original randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were only included and critically appraised using the Cochrane risk of bias (ROB) tool.
RESULTS: Seven RCTs (4091 patients) were analyzed. CEPDs significantly reduced the risk of disabling stroke within 2-5 days post-TAVI (relative risk = 0.455, 95% CI: [0.214, 0.967]; p = 0.041). However, there was no significant difference in disabling stroke risk between the two groups at the 30-day follow-up (relative risk = 1.295, 95% CI: [0.373, 4.493]; p = 0.684). No significant differences were observed in non-disabling or overall stroke rates at 2-5 days, 30 days, or 90 days. Additionally, CEPDs did not significantly affect risks of life-threatening bleeding, major vascular complications, mortality, or acute kidney injury.
CONCLUSION: CEPDs are effective in reducing disabling stroke risk in the immediate post-TAVI period (2-5 days) but did not significantly affect the rates of non-disabling stroke, overall stroke, or disabling stroke after 30 days when compared to non-CEPD use. These findings suggest that CEPDs may offer short-term neuroprotection.","['Mahmoud Balata', 'Mohamed Ibrahim Gbreel', 'Mohamed Hamouda Elkasaby', 'Ahmed Samy Badran', 'Marwa Hassan', 'Ralf Westenfeld', 'Roman Pfister', 'Sebastian Zimmer', 'Marc Ulrich Becher', 'Georg Nickenig', 'Atsushi Sugiura']",Cardiovascular intervention and therapeutics,2025-05-10,10.1007/s12928-025-01128-3,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12928-025-01128-3,PMC5234463,Free,Cerebral embolic protection in transcatheter aortic valve implantation TAVI a pooled analysis of 4091 patients BALATA 2025,pdfs\Cerebral embolic protection in transcatheter aortic valve implantation TAVI a pooled analysis of 4091 patients BALATA 2025.pdf,"['transcatheter aortic valve', 'Library window', 'aortic valve implantation', 'Library', 'references', 'EndNote', 'transcatheter aortic', 'reviewers', 'EndNote library', 'title']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Cerebral embolic protection', 'Meta-analysis', 'Neurological complications', 'Systematic review', 'Transcatheter valve implantation']"
40347199,Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement With Intra-Annular Self-Expanding or Balloon-Expandable Valves: The Multicenter International NAVULTRA Registry.,"BACKGROUND: No comparative data exist with the self-expanding Navitor (NAV) and the balloon-expandable SAPIEN 3 Ultra (ULTRA) transcatheter heart valves (THVs).
OBJECTIVES: This study sought to investigate the 1-year outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement using the intra-annular NAV and the ULTRA THVs.
METHODS: The NAVULTRA (Navitor and SAPIEN 3 Ultra) registry included consecutive patients who underwent transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement at 16 centers with NAV or ULTRA between November 2018 and April 2024. Propensity score matching was used for adjustment. The primary outcomes of interest were all-cause death and the composite of all-cause death, disabling stroke, and hospitalization for heart failure at 1 year.
RESULTS: The overall study cohort included 3,878 patients treated with NAV (n = 1,746) or ULTRA (n = 2,176). The propensity score-matched population resulted in 1,363 pairs. At 1 year, the rate of death from any cause was 9.7% with NAV and 9.9% with ULTRA (adjusted P = 0.585). Similarly, there were no significant differences in primary composite outcome (13.6% in the NAV group and 12.6% in the ULTRA group; adjusted P = 0.218). The rate of new permanent pacemaker implantation (20.6% vs 10.6%; adjusted P < 0.01) and heart failure rehospitalization (4.6% vs 2.8%; adjusted P < 0.05) was higher in NAV group. At 1 year, the use of NAV was associated with higher rates of mild paravalvular leak (OR: 1.53; 95% CI: 1.01 to 2.33; adjusted P < 0.05) but lower mean transprosthetic gradients compared with ULTRA (mean change:-3.90, 95% CI: -4.47 to -3.34; adjusted P < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Both intra-annular THVs were associated with similar 1-year clinical outcomes; however, differences were observed in secondary clinical endpoints and valve hemodynamic performance.","['Stefano Cannata', 'Ibrahim Sultan', 'Nicolas Van Mieghem', 'Arturo Giordano', 'Ole De Backer', 'Johnathan Byrne', 'Didier Tchetche', 'Sergio Buccheri', 'Luis Nombela-Franco', 'Rui Campante Teles', 'Marco Barbanti', 'Emanuele Barbato', 'Ignacio Amat Santos', 'Daniel J Blackman', 'Francesco Maisano', 'Roberto Lorusso', 'Ketty La Spina', 'Antonella Millin', 'Dustin E Kliner', 'Mark van den Dorpel', 'Elena Acerbi', 'Davorka Lulic', 'Kaivalya Divekar', 'Vincenzo Cesario', 'Jorge Francisco Chavez Solsol', 'Joao Brito', 'Giuliano Costa', 'Matteo Casenghi', 'Clara Fernandez Cordon', 'Amanda Sherwen', 'Nicola Buzzatti', 'Salvatore Pasta', 'Marco Turrisi', 'Michele Minacori', 'Paolo Manca', 'Vincenzo Nuzzi', 'Corrado Tamburino', 'Francesco Bedogni', 'Caterina Gandolfo', 'Azeem Latib']",JACC.

40347197,Rotational Atherectomy of Aorto-Ostial Calcification and Retained Native Leaflet to Facilitate Valve-in-Valve TAVI.,"BACKGROUND: A 72-year-old patient presented with breathlessness and presyncope due to severe stenosis within a 25-mm Perimount bioprosthetic aortic valve. The patient had hepatic cirrhosis and was not a candidate for redo surgical valve replacement. A computed tomography transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) demonstrated severe aorto-ostial left main calcific disease, with dense calcification from the annulus to the inferior border of the left main ostium, which was thought to represent a retained native leaflet, with high risk of coronary obstruction.
CASE SUMMARY: Using cerebral protection, rotational atherectomy was undertaken through the aorto-ostial calcification and retained leaflet, followed by left main stem percutaneous coronary intervention. A staged TAVI with a 23-mm Sapien S3 and a chimney stent for coronary protection was successful.
DISCUSSION: Although concomitant left main stem rotational atherectomy and TAVI have been described, no reports of rotablation to facilitate leaflet modification have been identified.

40345873,Immediate transcatheter aortic valve replacement versus temporizing balloon aortic valvuloplasty in severe aortic stenosis: A systematic review and meta-analysis immediate TAVR vs. temporizing BAV.,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a first-line therapy for severe aortic stenosis (AS). In patients with contraindications to immediate TAVR, temporizing balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) may be performed to stabilize patients prior to TAVR. The relative efficacy and safety of TAVR with or without temporizing BAV remains inadequately described.
METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases for studies comparing TAVR with and without temporizing BAV in patients with severe AS. Random-effects models were used to calculate pooled odds, risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: Nine studies (59,205 patients: 95.7 % immediate TAVR, 4.3 % BAV + TAVR) met inclusion criteria. Mean age was 82.9 ± 6.6 years old, and 45.9 % were males. Patients in the TAVR group were a mean difference of 1 year younger with no difference in gender distribution between groups. Direct TAVR was associated with a lower risk of 30-day all-cause mortality than BAV + TAVR (RR = 0.62; 95 % CI 0.41 to 0.93; p = 0.02). There were no significant differences in risks of post-procedural pacemaker implantation, myocardial infarction, cardiac tamponade, major vascular complications, ischemic stroke, major bleeding, 2+ or greater aortic regurgitation grade or acute kidney injury.
CONCLUSION: While immediate TAVR was associated with slightly lower short-term mortality compared to BAV + TAVR in patients with severe AS, other binary endpoints were equivalent. This potential mortality difference should be considered when offering BAV + TAVR in patients with contraindications to immediate TAVR. Randomized studies are required to confirm these results.","['Mohamed Doma', 'Wilbert Huang', 'Sarai Hernandez', 'Syeda Rubab Fatima', 'Shanmukh Lingamsetty', 'Mangesh Kritya', 'Maya Hemdanieh', 'Zahra Naji', 'Douglas Mesadri Gewehr', 'Felipe Villa Martignoni', 'Andrew M Goldsweig']",Cardiovascular revascularization medicine : including molecular interventions,2025-04-29,10.1016/j.carrev.2025.04.019,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.carrev.2025.04.019,,Paid,Immediate transcatheter aortic valve replacement versus temporizing balloon aortic valvuloplasty in severe aortic stenosis A systematic review and meta analysis immediate TAVR vs temporizing BAV DOMA 2025,Not available,"['transcatheter aortic valve', 'TAVR', 'aortic valve replacement', 'severe aortic stenosis', 'temporizing balloon aortic', 'valve replacement versus', 'transcatheter aortic', 'balloon aortic valvuloplasty', 'BAV', 'temporizing BAV']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Aortic stenosis', 'Balloon aortic valvuloplasty', 'Transcatheter aortic valve implantation']"

40345731,Orthotopic Left Main Chimney Stenting to Prevent Stent Compression After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.,"Coronary obstruction (CO) is a severe complication of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). An 80-year-old woman presenting with severe aortic stenosis was referred for TAVR. A preprocedural computed tomography revealed risk factors for CO: narrow aortic root and borderline-low coronary height. During TAVR, both coronaries were protected. After transcatheter heart valve (THV) implantation, contrast staining of the left sinus and leaflet interaction with the left main (LM) ostium were noted, prompting LM stenting to prevent obstruction. Because the THV-aorta space was virtual, we opted for rewiring and LM stenting through a THV cell. A postprocedural computed tomograohy revealed a permeable, well-expanded stent. Chimney stenting between the THV and aorta may be unfeasible in patients with a narrow aorta because of a risk of stent compression. Orthotopic chimney stenting through a THV cell may be preferable to classic chimney stenting in patients with a narrow aorta and minimal THV-aorta space.","['Ruxandra I Sava', 'Hakim Benamer', 'Julien Quillet', 'Maximilien Sochala', 'Philippe M Garot', 'Mariama Akodad']",JACC.

40345648,Balloon-Expandable versus Self-Expanding Valves in Patients With Prior Surgical Mitral Valve Replacement Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.,"BACKGROUND: Preexisting mitral prosthesis raises technical challenges for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) but has been scarcely studied. This study sought to compare outcomes of patients with previous surgical mitral valve prostheses undergoing TAVR with balloon-expandable (BEV) or self-expanding valve (SEV) systems.
METHODS: Patients from the Spanish TAVR registry with preexisting surgical mitral prostheses were included. The primary endpoints were Valve Academic Research Consortium-3 technical and device success and were analyzed according to valve type. The rates of transcatheter heart valve (THV) embolization, mitral valve impingement, THV performance and pacemaker were also assessed.
RESULTS: A total of 243 patients were included (BEV: 37%; SEV: 63%). Overall technical success was 95.9%. 30-day device success was higher in BEV patients (94.4% vs 85.0%, p=0.036), mainly driven by lower incidences of moderate residual aortic regurgitation (0% vs 5.9%, p=0.028) and THV embolization (0% vs 3.9%, p=0.087). BEV recipients exhibited higher mean transvalvular gradients (10.5 vs 8.1 mmHg, p=0.002) and lower rates of permanent pacemaker implantation (5.6% vs 15.7%, p=0.023). There were no differences in mortality, bleeding or readmission at 30 days. In multivariate analysis, a mitroaortic distance ≤7 mm and lack of transesophageal echocardiography guidance were associated with increased device failure.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with preexisting MV prostheses, TAVR was safe and effective regardless of the THV type. Nevertheless, the use of BEVs resulted in a greater rate of device success driven by lesser THV embolization and residual aortic regurgitation.","['Lluis Asmarats', 'Pilar Jiménez-Quevedo', 'Ignacio J Amat-Santos', 'María-Cruz Ferrer-Gracia', 'Fernando Sarnago', 'Juan H Alonso-Briales', 'Juan Francisco Oteo', 'Vicenç Serra', 'Guillem Muntané-Carol', 'Victoria Vilalta', 'David Del Val', 'Manuel Pan', 'José M De la Torre Hernández', 'Sergio García-Blas', 'José Luis Díez', 'Alberto Berenguer', 'Raquel Del Valle', 'Felipe Navarro Del Amo', 'Miguel Artaiz', 'Ander Regueiro', 'Manuel López-Pérez', 'Albert Massó van-Roessel', 'José G Paredes-Vázquez', 'Clara Fernández-Cordón', 'José Antonio Diarte de Miguel', 'Nicolás Maneiro', 'Alberto Piserra-López', 'Jorge de la Fuente', 'Juan Muñoz', 'Rafael Romaguera', 'Xavier Carrillo', 'Fernando Alfonso', 'Marco Alvarado', 'Gabriela Veiga', 'Xavier Millán', 'Luis Nombela-Franco', 'Dabit Arzamendi']",The Canadian journal of cardiology,2025-05-07,10.1016/j.cjca.2025.04.026,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2025.04.026,,Paid,Balloon Expandable versus Self Expanding Valves in Patients With Prior Surgical Mitral Valve Replacement Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement ASMARATS 2025,Not available,"['Prior Surgical Mitral', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Replacement Undergoing Transcatheter', 'Valve Replacement Undergoing', 'Valve Replacement', 'Mitral Valve Replacement', 'Surgical Mitral Valve', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Prior Surgical', 'Valve']",2025-05-12,Pending,[]
40344455,Restoration of a Stuck Leaflet.,"Severe aortic regurgitation (AR) for a leaflet malfunction after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is a dreadful complication that can lead even to cardiogenic shock. New valve's design has reduced the rate of paravalvular regurgitation, however central regurgitation is still a challenging complication. An 88-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis underwent TAVI with an Edwards Sapien III valve. After the procedure, angiography revealed third-degree angiographic central AR, causing hemodynamic instability. The team suspected a stuck leaflet and corrected it with catheter manipulation. The patient's condition stabilized, and follow-up echocardiography showed proper valve position and function. Severe AR following TAVI, while rare, can result in critical clinical deterioration. Recent evidence suggest that even mild grade of AR post-TAVI can affect long-term outcomes.

40343748,Bicuspid aortic valve disease: advancements and challenges of transcatheter aortic valve implantation.,"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has revolutionized the treatment of patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS). Initially developed for patients with tricuspid aortic valve (TAV) anatomy, the procedural success and expanding indications of TAVI have spurred interest in its application to more complex aortic valve anatomies, such as the bicuspid aortic valve (BAV). The growing interest in this specific sub-set of patients with AS is driven by the recent extension of TAVI indications to younger individuals, who exhibit a notably higher incidence of bicuspid anatomy compared with older populations. Bicuspid aortic valves present distinct anatomical and pathological complexities that pose significant challenges to the conventional TAVI approach. These include asymmetric calcification, aortic root dilation (also known as BAV aortopathy), and variations in cusp fusion patterns, which can affect valve deployment, transcatheter heart valve sealing, and long-term durability. Despite these challenges, advancements in imaging techniques, valve design, and procedural strategies have led to increased adoption of TAVI in BAV patients. However, surgical aortic valve replacement still retains a more prominent role in this group compared with patients with TAVs. This preference is partly due to the exclusion of BAV patients from almost all previous randomized controlled trials, which limits the available evidence supporting the use of TAVI in this unique cohort. This state-of-the-art review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current landscape of TAVI in BAV patients, including an analysis of anatomical considerations and procedural pitfalls, as well as outcomes' improvements with new device iterations. It will also explore clinical data, tackling the risks, benefits, and the evolving role of TAVI in this unique patient cohort.","['Marco Barbanti', 'Giuliano Costa', 'Stephan Windecker', 'Francesco Maisano', 'Giulia Laterra', 'Jonathon Leipsic', 'Philipp Blanke', 'Vinayak N Bapat', 'Martin B Leon', 'John G Webb']",European heart journal,2025-05-09,10.1093/eurheartj/ehaf307,https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehaf307,,Paid,Bicuspid aortic valve disease advancements and challenges of transcatheter aortic valve implantation BARBANTI 2025,Not available,"['aortic valve implantation', 'aortic valve', 'TAVI', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'aortic', 'aortic valve disease', 'Bicuspid aortic valve', 'valve', 'BAV patients', 'Bicuspid aortic']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Aortopathy', 'Bicuspid aortic valve', 'Bioprosthesis', 'Congenital heart disease', 'Sizing', 'TAVI', 'Transcatheter aortic valve implantation']"
40340592,Characterization of Aortic Valve Stenosis by CT Angiography in a Diverse US Cohort.,"BACKGROUND: Aortic stenosis (AS) involves calcific and fibrotic degeneration of the valve tissue. The only noninvasive method for evaluating both processes is contrast-enhanced computed tomography angiography. We aimed to explore the differences in aortic valve (AV) tissue composition across sex, race/ethnicity, and AS hemodynamic phenotype in US patients referred for transcatheter AV replacement planning.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed symptomatic patients with AS who underwent computed tomography angiography for transcatheter AV replacement planning between 2015 and 2022. Using semi-automated software, we quantified the AV tissue composition by fibrotic, calcific, and fibro-calcific volumes, and the fibro-calcific ratio (fibrotic/calcific volume) as a measure of valve phenotype.
RESULTS: The study included 651 patients (mean age 84 years; 55% women) with 38% non-Hispanic (NH)-White, 27% Hispanic, and 13% NH-Black. Women had lower fibro-calcific (230 versus 293 mm³/cm²; P<0.001) and calcific volumes (85 versus 149 mm³/cm²; P<0.001), and higher fibro-calcific ratio (1.47 versus 0.83; P<0.001). No differences were observed in the fibrotic volumes (P=0.805). NH-White women had higher fibro-calcific (256 mm³/cm², P=0.002) and fibrotic volumes (145 mm³/cm²; P<0.001), and fibro-calcific ratio (1.57; P=0.01) compared with Hispanic and NH-Black women. No differences were found among men. High-gradient AS had higher fibro-calcific (295 versus 219 mm3/cm2; P<0.001) and calcific volumes (148 versus 88 mm3/cm2; P<0.001), and a lower fibro-calcific ratio (0.90 versus 1.45; P<0.001), although no difference in fibrotic volume (P=0.099) compared with low-gradient AS.
CONCLUSIONS: Phenotypic differences in computed tomography angiography valve tissue composition exist in AS patients referred for transcatheter AV replacement, with females and low-gradient AS showing a proportionally more fibrotic phenotype. NH-White women have the highest fibrotic tissue composition, and no differences are evident among men.","['Daniel Lorenzatti', 'Annalisa Filtz', 'Pamela Pina', 'Jolien Geers', 'Jake Gilman', 'Jonathan Daich', 'Paul Ippolito', 'Aftab Abdullah', 'Aldo L Schenone', 'Carlos A Gongora', 'Justin Johannesen', 'Andrea Scotti', 'Edwin C Ho', 'Mario J Garcia', 'Azeem Latib', 'Carlos J Rodriguez', 'Daniel S Berman', 'Marie-Annick Clavel', 'Philippe Pibarot', 'Robert O Bonow', 'Piotr J Slomka', 'Marc R Dweck', 'Damini Dey', 'Leandro Slipczuk']",Circulation.

40340124,Predictors of permanent pacemaker implantation after TAVI with Navitor transcatheter heart valve.,"AIMS: This study aimed to identify predictors of permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI) within 30 days after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) using the Navitor™ (Abbott Chicago, IL, USA) transcatheter heart valve (THV).
METHODS AND RESULTS: This retrospective two-center study included 173 patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing transfemoral TAVI with Navitor™ THV. Patients with prior pacemaker implantation and valve-in-valve procedures were excluded. Mean age was 81.5 ± 5.0 years, and 54 patients (31 %) required PPI; they were more often male (57 % vs. 37 %, p = 0.01), had higher left ventricular ejection fraction (55.3 ± 9.0 vs. 52.4 ± 9.2, p = 0.049), and higher rates of COPD (30 % vs. 16 %, p = 0.017) and pre-existing right bundle branch block (RBBB; 17 % vs. 0.8 %, p < 0.001). Procedural factors associated with PPI included greater annulus-to-THV oversizing (13.6 % ± 3.4 vs. 12.5 % ± 3.1, p = 0.041), implantation depth > 4 mm (75.9 % vs. 52.1 %, p = 0.002), and 29 mm valve size use (46.3 % vs. 26.9 %, p = 0.010). At multivariable analysis, COPD (OR 2.4, p = 0.049), pre-existing RBBB (OR 34.4, p = 0.001), annulus-to-THV oversizing (OR 1.2, p = 0.002), and implantation depth > 4 mm (OR 3.2, p = 0.007) were independent predictors of PPI. ROC analysis (AUC 0.58) identified an optimal cut-off of 15 % annulus-to-THV oversizing for predicting PPI.
CONCLUSIONS: Annulus-to-THV oversizing emerges as a novel independent predictor for PPI after TAVI with Navitor™ THV.","['Matteo Casenghi', 'Sara Corradetti', 'Stefano Rigattieri', 'Francesca Giovannelli', 'Marta Belmonte', 'Marco Redivo', 'Carlo Terrone', 'Daniele Barzetti', 'Antonella Tommasino', 'Eric Wyffels', 'Emanuele Gallinoro', 'Raffaella Mistrulli', 'Pasquale Paolisso', 'Andrea Berni', 'Marc Vanderheyden', 'Emanuele Barbato']",Cardiovascular revascularization medicine : including molecular interventions,2025-05-02,10.1016/j.carrev.2025.04.039,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.carrev.2025.04.039,,Paid,Predictors of permanent pacemaker implantation after TAVI with Navitor transcatheter heart valve CASENGHI 2025,Not available,"['transcatheter heart valve', 'Navitor transcatheter heart', 'permanent pacemaker implantation', 'TAVI with Navitor', 'transcatheter heart', 'permanent pacemaker', 'TAVI', 'pacemaker implantation', 'Abbott Chicago', 'heart valve']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Implantation depth', 'Navitor', 'Oversizing', 'Pacemaker implantation', 'TAVI', 'Transcatheter aortic valve implantation']"

40337394,Transcaval access for transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Transfemoral access is considered the standard route for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). However, in some cases, this access route is contraindicated. Alternative access routes, such as transaxillary, are emerging as first-line approaches to address these limitations, while the transcaval approach remains uncertain. Our Meta-analysis aims to evaluate the safety of the transcaval approach compared to other access routes for TAVR.
METHODS: We searched five databases, PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Embase, from inception until April 2024 for any study that reports transcaval access alone or compares it to any alternative access in TAVR patients. We used Risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and Mean Difference (MD) for continuous outcomes with a 95% confidence interval.
RESULTS: Eleven studies with 1003 patients were included, transcaval showed non-statistically significant difference over alternatives in terms of intra-hospital, 30 days, and long-term all-cause mortality with a RR of 0.08 (95% CI -0.83 to 0.99, P = 0.86), 0.11 (95% CI -0.48 to 0.7, P = 0.71), and 1.08 (95% CI -0.50 to 2.66, P = 0.18), respectively. Furthermore, in our single-arm analysis, transcaval access has a low pooled 30-day all-cause mortality rate of 7% (95% CI 5-10) and long-term mortality of 21% (95% CI 2-77). The mean difference in length of stay in the hospital after the operation was 4.88 (95% CI 4.45-5.31), and the major bleeding rate was 14% (95% CI 8-23).
CONCLUSION: Transcaval access for TAVR is a safe and feasible method that can be considered a new alternative when trans-femoral access is contraindicated.","['Zina Otmani', 'Ahmad Alzawahreh', 'Abdelaziz A Awad', 'Basma Badrawy Khalefa', 'Hazem Ayman Elsayed', 'Omar Hany Mohamed Amin', 'Mohamed Abouzid', 'Amjad Almansi', 'Ayman K Awad']",Annals of medicine and surgery (2012),2025-05-12,10.1097/MS9.0000000000003193,https://doi.org/10.1097/MS9.0000000000003193,PMC12055168,Free,Transcaval access for transcatheter aortic valve replacement a systematic review and meta analysis OTMANI 2025,pdfs\Transcaval access for transcatheter aortic valve replacement a systematic review and meta analysis OTMANI 2025.pdf,"['Transcaval access', 'access', 'Transcaval', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'aortic valve replacement', 'aortic valve', 'TAVR', 'transcatheter aortic', 'mortality', 'aortic']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['meta-analysis', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement', 'transcaval']"
40336936,Two cases of direct aortic transcatheter aortic valve implantation via anterior right Mini-thoracotomy after preoperative virtual reality-based simulation: a case report.,"BACKGROUND: In direct aortic transcatheter aortic valve implantation for patients with aortic stenosis, anterior right mini-thoracotomy presents challenges due to the limited visual field and raises concerns about significant bleeding. Furthermore, identifying the site closest to the ascending aorta while maintaining an adequate distance from the annulus is challenging. We report on the effectiveness of our preoperative simulation using virtual reality technology to ensure a safe and precise direct aortic transcatheter aortic valve implantation via anterior right mini-thoracotomy in two patients.
CASE SUMMARY: The patients were an 81-year-old man (Patient 1) and an 86-year-old woman (Patient 2) with aortic stenosis; their ascending aorta was closest to the third intercostal space. In Patient 1, virtual reality simulation revealed that, according to the distance and angulation from the annulus, the ideal puncture site was the second intercostal space. Accordingly, an anterior right mini-thoracotomy was performed at the second intercostal space, and a 23-mm SAPIEN 3 valve (Edwards Lifesciences Ltd.) was adequately implanted. Conversely, in Patient 2, the virtual reality assessment indicated that the third intercostal space was the appropriate site of entry. Therefore, anterior right mini-thoracotomy was performed at the third intercostal space, and a 23-mm SAPIEN 3 valve was successfully implanted, without difficulties.
DISCUSSION: The use of preoperative virtual reality simulation enabled the safe and precise execution of direct aortic transcatheter aortic valve implantation via anterior right mini-thoracotomy.

40336935,When the heart becomes suicidal: a case report of severe left ventricular outflow tract obstruction following transcatheter aortic valve implantation.,"BACKGROUND: Replacement of the aortic valve is a Class I recommendation for treatment of patients suffering from severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis. However, aortic valve replacement can occasionally lead to complications, including development of acute left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction. This rare but severe complication is referred to as the so-called 'suicide left ventricle' phenomenon.
CASE SUMMARY: This case report presents an 88-year-old woman who developed severe LVOT obstruction following a successful transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), complicated by septal anterior motion of the mitral valve resulting in severe mitral regurgitation. Despite initial intensive care management, her symptoms persisted, necessitating the application of transcoronary ablation of septal hypertrophy as a bail-out procedure. Transcoronary ablation of septal hypertrophy, typically used in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, successfully reduced the LVOT gradient and relieved symptoms.
DISCUSSION: This case emphasizes the importance of pre-operative identification of LVOT obstruction risk factors, awareness for this complication and a well-experience multidisciplinary team for the management of TAVI-associated complications.","['Carl Schulz', 'Fabian J Brunner', 'Simon Pecha', 'Nils Sörensen', 'Niklas Schofer']",European heart journal.

40334981,Prevalence and clinical outcomes of permanent conduction disturbances after Transcatheter aortic valve replacement.,"BACKGROUND: A new-onset conduction disturbance is a major concern in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) but can resolve over time. This study aimed to evaluate the recovery in conduction disturbances post-TAVR and its association with clinical outcomes.
METHODS: This retrospective study included 780 TAVR patients at St. Marianna University between January 2016 and March 2023. Patients were stratified into four groups based on conduction status at six months post-TAVR: no conduction disturbance, recovered conduction disturbance [defined as a post-procedural pacemaker implantation with cumulative right ventricular pacing <40 % or complete left bundle branch block (CLBBB) at discharge but not at six months], permanent conduction disturbance (defined as pacemaker implantation with cumulative right ventricular pacing ≥40 % or CLBBB at both discharge and six months), and preprocedural conduction disturbance. The primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalization. The secondary outcome was the change in cardiac damage from pre-procedure to one-year post-TAVR.
RESULTS: Of 780 patients, 220 (28 %) had new-onset CLBBB or required a pacemaker implantation at discharge. Among these, 99 (45 %) had permanent conduction disturbances at six months. Over a median follow-up of 788 days, both permanent and preprocedural conduction disturbances were significantly associated with a higher incidence of heart failure hospitalization [hazard ratio (HR) 3.63; 95 % confidence interval (CI): 2.04-6.47, p < 0.01 and HR 2.50; 95 % CI: 1.27-4.90, p < 0.01), although no difference in all-cause mortality was observed. In contrast, the prognosis of patients with recovered conduction disturbance was comparable with those with no conduction disturbance. Patients with permanent and preprocedural conduction disturbances showed significant worsening cardiac damage.
CONCLUSION: Permanent and preprocedural conduction disturbances after TAVR were associated with increased heart failure hospitalizations, while the prognostic impact of recovered conduction disturbance may be limited.","['Takahiko Kai', 'Masaki Izumo', 'Masahiro Sekiguchi', 'Tetsu Tanaka', 'Taishi Okuno', 'Yukio Sato', 'Shingo Kuwata', 'Masashi Koga', 'Ikutaro Nakajima', 'Kenichi Sasaki', 'Yasuhiro Tanabe', 'Tomoo Harada', 'Yoshihiro J Akashi']",Journal of cardiology,2025-05-05,10.1016/j.jjcc.2025.04.013,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jjcc.2025.04.013,,Paid,Prevalence and clinical outcomes of permanent conduction disturbances after Transcatheter aortic valve replacement KAI 2025,Not available,"['Transcatheter aortic valve', 'aortic valve replacement', 'conduction disturbance', 'conduction', 'Transcatheter aortic', 'preprocedural conduction disturbances', 'undergoing transcatheter aortic', 'valve replacement', 'preprocedural conduction', 'recovered conduction disturbance']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Aortic stenosis', 'Conduction disturbance', 'Transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"

40329985,Assessment of the Impact of Dexmedetomidine on Myocardial Injury in TAVI Patients: A Retrospective Cohort Study Utilizing PSM-DID.,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) is a minimally invasive procedure for treating severe aortic valve diseases but can lead to perioperative myocardial damage (PMD). Dexmedetomidine (DEX), an α2-adrenergic receptor agonist, has shown potential to reduce myocardial injury in other cardiac procedures. This effect is attributed to its anti-inflammatory properties, which help reduce the inflammatory response associated with myocardial damage, and its antioxidant properties, which combat oxidative stress that contributes to cell injury. But its effectiveness during TAVI remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of DEX on myocardial injury in patients undergoing TAVI under general anesthesia.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of 159 patients (after exclusions) who underwent TAVI from January 2022 to August 2024. Patients were divided into DEX and control groups. Primary outcomes were peak levels of cardiac troponin I and CK-MB within 48 hours postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included IL-6, PCT, and NT-proBNP levels. Propensity score matching (PSM) and Differences-in-Differences (DID) method were used for analysis.
RESULTS: After PSM, the DEX group exhibited significantly lower peak values of troponin I (P < 0.001) and CK-MB (P < 0.001) compared to the control group, indicating reduced myocardial injury. No significant differences were observed in IL-6, PCT, and NT-proBNP levels between the groups. The DID analysis suggested a negative correlation between DEX use and major adverse postoperative events, highlighting DEX as a potential protective factor.
CONCLUSION: Dexmedetomidine administration during TAVI was associated with reduced levels of myocardial injury markers, indicating a potential cardioprotective role. By reducing myocardial injury, DEX may contribute to improved perioperative outcomes, including a decreased risk of major adverse postoperative events. These results highlight the potential clinical utility of DEX in the perioperative management of TAVI patients, suggesting that its inclusion in anesthetic protocols could enhance patient care and recovery.","['Yang Song', 'Jin Zhang', 'Huiping Xu', 'Chaoqun Gui', 'Hao Cheng', 'Yongquan Chen', 'Shaolin Wang']",Therapeutics and clinical risk management,2025-05-12,10.2147/TCRM.S507439,https://doi.org/10.2147/TCRM.S507439,PMC12053920,Free,Assessment of the Impact of Dexmedetomidine on Myocardial Injury in TAVI Patients A Retrospective Cohort Study Utilizing PSM DID SONG 2025,pdfs\Assessment of the Impact of Dexmedetomidine on Myocardial Injury in TAVI Patients A Retrospective Cohort Study Utilizing PSM DID SONG 2025.p.pdf,"['Myocardial Injury', 'DEX', 'Myocardial', 'TAVI', 'TAVI Patients', 'Injury', 'Patients', 'DEX group', 'patients undergoing TAVI', 'Retrospective Cohort Study']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['dexmedetomidine', 'inflammation', 'myocardial ischemia', 'propensity score', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"
40328542,Semiquantitative metrics of coronary artery disease burden: Intra-individual comparison between ultrahigh-resolution photon-counting detector CT and energy-integrating detector CT.,"BACKGROUND: Quantitative coronary stenosis and plaque volumes have demonstrated intra-individual differences between ultrahigh-resolution (UHR) photon-counting detector (PCD)-CT and energy-integrating detector (EID)-CT. This study aimed to assess the impact of UHR PCD-CT on semiquantitative scores of coronary artery disease (CAD) burden compared with EID-CT.
METHODS: Patients undergoing coronary CT angiography (CCTA) on an EID-CT system for stable chest pain or pre-transcatheter aortic valve replacement evaluation were prospectively enrolled for UHR PCD-CT scan within 30 days. Both datasets were visually evaluated using five established semiquantitative scores: Segment Involvement Score (SIS), Segment Stenosis Score (SSS), Multivessel Aggregate Stenosis Score (MVAS), CCTA-adapted Leaman score (CT-LeSc), and Coronary Artery Disease Reporting and Data System (CAD-RADS). Additionally, the total number of detected plaques and high-risk features were reported (positive remodeling, spotty calcification, low-attenuation, and napkin-ring sign).
RESULTS: The cohort comprised 46 patients (37 men, 68.4 ​± ​6.9 years). When assessing stenosis severity, PCD-CT showed lower SSS (3.5 [1.3-5.0] vs 6.5 [3.0-9.8], p ​< ​0.001), MVAS (5.5 [4.0-7.0] vs 7.0 [5.0-9.0], p ​< ​0.001), and CT-LeSc (10.4 [8.5-13.9] vs 11.2 [8.8-15.4], p ​= ​0.032). Furthermore, 52 ​% (24/46) of patients were reclassified to a lower CAD-RADS category compared to EID-CT. In terms of CAD extent, PCD-CT demonstrated higher SIS (8.0 [6.0-9.0] vs 7.0 [6.0-8.8], p ​= ​0.018) and plaque count (9.0 [7.0-13.8] vs 7.0 [7.0-9.8] p ​< ​0.001). Positive remodeling was less frequent in PCD-CT datasets (2.0 [1.0-4.3] vs 1.0 [0.0-3.0], p ​= ​0.012), with no significant differences in other high-risk features.

40328422,Outcomes of Surgical versus Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Patients with Low-Flow Low-Gradient Aortic Stenosis.,"OBJECTIVE: This study sought to determine the impact of surgical (SAVR) versus transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in patients with low-flow low-gradient (LFLG) aortic stenosis (AS).
METHODS: This was an observational study of consecutive AVRs for severe AS from 2010 to 2023. Patients with LFLG (aortic valve mean gradient <40 mmHg and a stroke volume index <35 ml/m2) were included. Both classical (ejection fraction <50%) and paradoxical (ejection fraction ≥50%) subtypes were included. Concomitant procedures and history of prior AVR were excluded. Patients were dichotomized by intervention.
RESULTS: A total of 575 patients underwent isolated, first-time AVR for LFLG AS, of which 248 (43%) were low operative risk (STS-PROM <4%). 131 (52.8%) underwent SAVR and 117 (47.2%) underwent TAVR. The TAVR patients were older than the SAVR patients: 79.0 [76.0-84.0] years vs. 66.0 [59.0-73.0] years, p<0.001. The incidence of 30-day mortality, stroke, and pacemaker were no different across each group, but the incidence of PVL was higher in the TAVR group. At 1-year follow-up, aortic valve mean gradient (9.0 [7.0-12.0] mmHg) and ejection fraction (55.0% [40.0-60.0]) were no different across each group. On multivariable analysis, TAVR was not associated with an increased hazard of death compared to SAVR (HR 1.38, 95% CI: 0.72, 2.66, p=0.34) and it was not associated with an increased hazard of heart failure readmission (HR 1.70, 95% CI: 0.88, 3.30, p=0.11), compared to SAVR.
CONCLUSIONS: For patients with LFLG AS, surgical and transcatheter approaches to AVR may be equally as advantageous with respect to long-term outcomes.","['James A Brown', 'Eishan Ashwat', 'Nav Warraich', 'Nidhi Iyanna', 'Derek Serna-Gallegos', 'Dustin Kliner', 'Catalin Toma', 'David West', 'Amber Makani', 'Irsa Hasan', 'Takuya Ogami', 'Danial Ahmad', 'Floyd Thoma', 'Yisi Wang', 'Ibrahim Sultan']",The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,2025-04-23,10.1016/j.jtcvs.2025.04.034,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcvs.2025.04.034,,Paid,Outcomes of Surgical versus Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Patients with Low Flow Low Gradient Aortic Stenosis BROWN 2025,Not available,"['Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'versus Transcatheter Aortic', 'Low-Gradient Aortic Stenosis', 'Aortic Valve', 'Aortic Stenosis', 'Surgical versus Transcatheter', 'Low-Flow Low-Gradient Aortic', 'Valve Replacement', 'Transcatheter Aortic']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['aortic stenosis', 'surgical aortic valve replacement', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"

40325986,Prognostic implications and predictive factors of subclinical leaflet thrombosis following valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve implantation.,"BACKGROUND: Subclinical leaflet thrombosis, as indicated by hypoattenuated leaflet thickening (HALT) on computed tomography (CT) imaging, remains a major concern owing to its potential impact on valve function and patient outcomes.
AIMS: We aimed to evaluate the association between HALT and clinical outcomes in patients undergoing valve-in-valve (ViV) transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) with balloon-expandable valves and to identify predictors of leaflet thrombosis.
METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent ViV TAVI with balloon-expandable valves at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center were retrospectively analysed. We analysed both pre- and postprocedural CT scans to identify predictors of HALT at 1 month after ViV TAVI and the association of HALT with clinical outcomes. The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause mortality, hospitalisation for heart failure (HF), or stroke at 3 years.
RESULTS: Among the 117 patients analysed, HALT was detected in 37 (31.6%). In the multivariable analysis, anticoagulation therapy (odds ratio [OR] 0.28, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.08-0.92; p=0.037) and greater transcatheter heart valve (THV) expansion at the minimum area level (OR 0.95, 95% CI: 0.91-0.99; p=0.026) were significant predictors of reduced HALT following ViV TAVI. While there was no significant difference in all-cause mortality between patients with and without HALT (OR 1.13, 95% CI: 0.42-3.02; p=0.8), those with HALT had a significantly higher incidence of the composite primary outcome (OR 2.31, 95% CI: 1.04-5.15; p=0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: HALT was frequently observed in patients who underwent ViV TAVI. Additionally, the presence of HALT correlated with a higher incidence of composite outcomes, including all-cause mortality, hospitalisation for HF, and stroke.

AIMS: We sought to assess the association between quantitative CTA features of HALT and its evolution over time in a real-world cohort after TAVI.
METHODS: Among 612 patients who underwent CTA 30 days post-TAVI with balloon-expandable bioprostheses, HALT was detected in 118 (19%). We prospectively followed 99 patients who had undergone a second CTA at 1 year to assess HALT progression. Thrombus volume and mean attenuation were quantified using semiautomated software, and various parameters of bioprosthetic deformation were analysed.
RESULTS: Complete resolution of HALT was observed in 43 patients. Multivariate logistic regression showed that lower thrombus attenuation was an independent predictor of HALT resolution (odds ratio [OR] 0.45; p=0.030), along with the eccentricity index (OR 0.42; p=0.003), deformation index (OR 0.53; p=0.005), and implant canting (OR 1.88; p=0.026). In the 56 patients without complete HALT resolution, thrombus evolution was visually categorised as regression (48%), stability (29%), or progression (23%). In a quantitative assessment, regression was associated with a significant decrease in thrombus volume (291 mmÂ³ to 130 mmÂ³; p=0.007), while progression showed an increase (187 mmÂ³ to 667 mmÂ³; p=0.005). The change in thrombus volume between 30 days and 1 year correlated with the magnitude of changes in mean transvalvular gradients over the same period (r=0.462; p<0.001).

40325824,Immediate and Early Outcomes Following Myval Octacor Transcatheter Heart Valve Implantation for the Treatment of Patients With Severe Aortic Valve Stenosis: The OCTACOR-EU Study.,"BACKGROUND: THV is a standard treatment for elderly patients with severe AS, using either BE or self-expanding (SE) THVs. While the Myval BE THV has demonstrated safety and efficacy, data on its latest iteration, the Octacor, are limited.
AIMS: To evaluate the clinical performance of the next-generation Myval Octacor balloon-expandable (BE) transcatheter heart valve (THV) in patients with severe, symptomatic native aortic valve stenosis (AS).
METHODS: This observational, real-world, multicenter study involved patients deemed suitable for TAVR and treated with Octacor BE THV at 15 European centers. The primary endpoint was the rate of technical success (exit from procedure room) per VARC-3 criteria. Secondary endpoints included overall mortality, stroke, moderate-to-severe paravalvular leak (PVL), and need for permanent pacemaker (pPM) at 30-day and the longest available follow-up. An analysis by THV sizes (standard -20 to 29 mm vs. XL sizes -30.5 and 32 mm) was performed.
RESULTS: From January to December 2023, 252 patients with severe AS underwent TAVR with the Octacor THV. The average age was 80.6 ± 6.7 years, and the mean STS score was 3.45%. Bicuspid anatomy was reported in 7.1% of cases (standard group 5.4% vs. XL group 20%, p = 0.004). Technical success was achieved in 98.8% of procedures (standard group 99.1% vs. XL group 96.7%, p = 0.2). At 30 days, overall mortality was 1.2%, stroke 3.2%, moderate-to-severe PVL 0.8%, and pPM 16.3%.
CONCLUSIONS: The novel BE Myval Octacor THV showed high technical success and favorable early clinical outcomes.

40323430,Mutational landscape and impact of clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential in severe aortic valve stenosis.,"BACKGROUND: Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) has been progressively established as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and associated with worsened outcomes in patients with aortic valve stenosis (AVS). This cohort study aimed to evaluate the mutational landscape of CHIP and its' influence on clinical outcomes.
METHODS: 194 patients with AVS undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) were sequenced using a capture panel for multiple CH driver mutations and follow up conducted for three years.
RESULTS: We found high prevalences (77.8%) of a broad spectrum of CH-driver mutations across 38 genes, with 34% of patients fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for CHIP. Evaluating the impact of CHIP driver mutations on outcomes, the presence of CHIP was associated with mortality only when adjusting for confounding factors (HR: 2.143, 95% CI: 1.029-4.461, p = 0.042), while the presence of CH driver mutations at low VAF showed no association with mortality (p = 0.377). However, when excluding DNMT3A-CHIP, we found a significant association of CHIP with mortality in univariate (p = 0.022) and multivariable (HR: 2.976, 95% CI: 1.381-6.411, p = 0.005) analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: As the first study to evaluate a broad spectrum of CH driver mutations at all variant allele frequencies in the context of aortic valve stenosis, we found CHIP to be a frequent phenomenon and CH-driver mutations to be highly prevalent in patients with severe AVS. CHIP, other than DNMT3A-CHIP, was associated with increased mortality even after successful TAVR. The presence of CH driver mutations at low allele frequencies was not associated with mortality.","['Raúl Nicolas Jamin', 'Baravan Al-Kassou', 'Theresa Kleuker', 'Jasmin Shamekhi', 'Benedikt Bartsch', 'Ansgar Ackerschott', 'Muntadher Al Zaidi', 'Hannah Billig', 'Claus Moritz Graef', 'Malte Kelm', 'Stephan Baldus', 'Georg Nickenig', 'Eicke Latz', 'Sebastian Zimmer']",Clinical research in cardiology : official journal of the German Cardiac Society,2025-05-05,10.1007/s00392-025-02658-9,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00392-025-02658-9,PMC8874362,Free,Mutational landscape and impact of clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential in severe aortic valve stenosis JAMIN 2025,pdfs\Mutational landscape and impact of clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential in severe aortic valve stenosis JAMIN 2025.pdf,"['aortic valve stenosis', 'Medicare', 'CHIP', 'clonal hematopoiesis', 'aortic valve', 'driver mutations', 'CHIP driver mutations', 'patients', 'valve stenosis', 'MDS']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Aortic valve stenosis', 'Clonal hematopoiesis', 'Transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"

40320003,Machine Learning Methods to Predicting Transvalvular Gradient Waveform Post-Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Using Pre-procedural Echocardiogram.,"OBJECTIVE: Time-varying transvalvular pressure gradient after transcatheter aortic valve replacement indicates the effectiveness of the therapy. The objective was to develop a novel machine learning method enhanced by generative artificial intelligence and smart data selection strategies to predict the post-transcatheter aortic valve replacement gradient waveform using pre-procedural Doppler echocardiogram.
METHODS: A total of 110 patients undergoing TAVR (mean age 78.2 ± 9.0 years, 52.5% female) were included for pressure gradient collection. A deep machine learning model was trained and tested to predict post-procedural pressure gradient waveform from pre-procedural pressure gradient waveform based on the proposed generative active learning framework.
RESULTS: The trained model demonstrated an average prediction accuracy of 84.85% across the 10 test patients measured from the relative mean absolute error between the predicted gradient waveform and ground truth. The generative method improved prediction accuracy by 3.11%, while the data selection strategy increased it by 16.03% compared to the baseline experimental group using plain machine learning. Additionally, Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated a strong agreement between the proposed method and clinical measurements for both mean and peak pressure gradient predictions.
CONCLUSIONS: A deep, generative, active machine learning model was developed to output the prediction of post-TAVR time-varying pressure gradient from the pre-procedural time-varying gradient obtained from Doppler echocardiogram. Such a predictive method may help guide decision-making for the prevention of various post-TAVR complications.

40319622,Perioperative management and outcomes of surgical pulmonary valve replacement following tetralogy of fallot repair: A retrospective study.,"BACKGROUND: While the long-term prognosis of Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) repair is favourable, the frequency of interventions for pulmonary valve insufficiency during follow-up remains high, raising concerns regarding its invasiveness. This study aimed to evaluate the safety measures and strategies for the perioperative management of pulmonary valve interventions following TOF repair.
METHODS: From November 2022 to December 2023, interventions in the pulmonary artery for TOF were performed in 17 patients; a retrospective analysis was conducted on all patients. Preoperative haemodynamic evaluation was performed using 4D-flow magnetic resonance imaging in all cases.
RESULTS: The 17 patients included in the study had a mean age of 24.1 ± 14 years. The mean duration from repair to re-intervention was 18.2 ± 12 years, with a preoperative right ventricular ejection fraction of 42.3 ± 12 %. The mean surgical time, cardiopulmonary bypass time, and aortic cross-clamp time were 389 ± 96, 210 ± 67, and 106 ± 48 min, respectively. Pulmonary valve replacement was performed in eight patients, with seven using porcine aortic valves and one using a bovine pericardial valve. The Rastelli-type procedure was performed in nine cases, with seven using expanded polytetrafluoroethylene valved conduits and two using composite grafts of a porcine bioprosthetic valve and Valsalva graft. Additional procedures included right ventricular outflow tract myectomy in nine patients, pulmonary artery reconstruction in five, cryoablation in four, coronary artery bypass grafting in three, tricuspid valve repair in three, and ventricular septal defect closure in one. There were no cases of early mortality, stroke, or re-operation within 30 days.
CONCLUSION: Interventions on the pulmonary valves following TOF repair can be safely performed with appropriate perioperative management. The primary goal of surgical pulmonary valve replacement is to preserve the right ventricular function and reconstruct a smooth pathway from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery, considering future transcatheter interventions. Further long-term follow-up is necessary to assess outcomes, such as remote mortality, right ventricular function, and arrhythmia occurrence.","['Chiaki Aichi', 'Keiichi Itatani', 'Yosuke Nakai', 'Takumi Kawase', 'Jiryo Haibara', 'Satoki Ozoe', 'Hisao Suda']",International journal of surgery case reports,2025-05-03,10.1016/j.ijscr.2025.111406,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2025.111406,,Paid,Perioperative management and outcomes of surgical pulmonary valve replacement following tetralogy of fallot repair A retrospective study AICHI 2025,Not available,"['tetralogy of fallot', 'pulmonary valve', 'pulmonary', 'pulmonary valve replacement', 'TOF', 'TOF repair', 'valve', 'surgical pulmonary valve', 'Perioperative management', 'pulmonary artery']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['4D-flow magnetic resonance imaging', 'Pulmonary valve replacement', 'Tetralogy of Fallot']"
40317314,Impact of an improvement in the early left ventricular ejection fraction on the 1-year clinical outcomes and its predictors after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.,"PURPOSE: We evaluated the 1-year clinical outcomes (all-cause mortality, heart failure rehospitalization, and their composite) in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) and a preoperative left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 50% who underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), and examined the baseline factors predicting ≥ 10% early LVEF improvement.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 44 patients who underwent TAVR and divided them into Group R (≥ 10% LVEF improvement, n = 25) or Group N (< 10% improvement, n = 19). A Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to assess the survival rates, and multivariable logistic regression was applied to identify the predictors of LVEF improvement.
RESULTS: The mean patient age was 84.8 ± 4.8 years, and 40.9% were male. Post-TAVR, 56.8% of patients showed ≥ 10% LVEF improvement (mean increase: 16.7 ± 6.1%). The one-year mortality was similar between the groups (p = 0.383), whereas the composite endpoint tended to be higher in Group N (0.4% vs. 21.1%, p = 0.072). The peak aortic valve velocity was the only significant predictor (OR = 0.255, p = 0.048; cutoff: 4.45 m/s, sensitivity, 0.840; specificity, 0.684).
CONCLUSION: In patients with severe AS and a preoperative LVEF of < 50%, 56.8% demonstrated a significant early LVEF improvement post-TAVR.

40312105,"Incidence, predictors and outcomes of tricuspid regurgitation progression after left-sided valvular intervention.","BACKGROUND: Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) progression following left-sided valvular heart disease (VHD) correction is a critical clinical concern. This study aimed to determine the incidence, predictors and outcomes of TR progression in a contemporary cohort.
METHODS: We analysed 1644 patients (mean age 73 years, 62% men) without severe TR who underwent surgical or transcatheter treatment for aortic or mitral disease between 2014 and 2018. TR progression was defined as an increase in TR grade to moderate or severe on follow-up echocardiography.
RESULTS: At 5 years, TR progression incidence was 12.0% (95% CI 10.5% to 13.7%). Baseline factors associated with TR progression included older age, female sex, atrial fibrillation, prior pacemaker implantation and larger tricuspid annular diameter (TAD). The relationship between TAD and TR progression was linear (HR 1.08; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.11; p<0.001), with sex differences mitigated by indexing TAD to body surface area. TR progression was associated with increased all-cause mortality (adjusted HR 2.77; 95% CI 2.16 to 3.56; p<0.001) and a combined endpoint of death or heart failure hospitalisation (adjusted HR 2.91; 95% CI 2.21 to 3.82; p<0.001).

40310672,Multimodal Visualization and Explainable Machine Learning-Driven Markers Enable Early Identification and Prognosis Prediction for Symptomatic Aortic Stenosis and Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: Multicenter Cohort Study.,"BACKGROUND: Currently, there is a paucity of literature addressing personalized risk stratification using multimodal data in patients with symptomatic aortic stenosis and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to enhance the performance of risk assessment models in this patient population by developing a predictive model for adverse outcomes using various machine learning (ML) techniques.
METHODS: This multicenter cohort study included 326 patients diagnosed with severe AS and HFpEF who underwent TAVR between January 2017 and December 2023. Patients were allocated to training (n=195) and independent validation (n=131) sets based on hospital affiliation. A dual-phase feature selection process, combining least absolute shrinkage and selection operator logistic regression and the Boruta algorithm, was used to identify relevant variables from the multimodal dataset. A total of 5 ML model-decision trees, K-nearest neighbors, random forest, support vector machine, and extreme gradient boosting were used to construct a visualization and explainable predictive framework to elucidate model decision-making processes.
RESULTS: The primary features identified included age, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, fasting blood glucose, triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio, triglyceride glucose index, triglyceride glucose-BMI index, atherogenic index of plasma index, and Apolipoprotein B. Among the 5 models, the support vector machine demonstrated the best predictive performance for major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events in patients with severe AS and HFpEF following TAVR, achieving an area under the curve of 0.756 (95% CI 0.631-0.881) in the independent validation set. The model exhibited good calibration and robust predictive power in both training and validation sets and demonstrated the highest net benefit in decision curve analysis compared to other models. To extract significant variables influencing the algorithm and ensure model appropriateness, we interpreted cohort and personalized model predictions using Shapley Additive Explanations values.
CONCLUSIONS: Our ML-based multimodal model, incorporating 8 readily accessible predictors, demonstrated robust predictive capability for 12 months of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events risk. This model can be used to identify high-risk individuals with AS and HFpEF following TAVR, potentially aiding in risk stratification and personalized treatment strategies.","['Jun Wang', 'Jiajun Zhu', 'Hui Li', 'Shili Wu', 'Siyang Li', 'Zhuoya Yao', 'Tongjian Zhu', 'Bi Tang', 'Shengxing Tang', 'Jinjun Liu']",Journal of medical Internet research,2025-05-01,10.2196/70587,https://doi.org/10.2196/70587,,Paid,Multimodal Visualization and Explainable Machine Learning Driven Markers Enable Early Identification and Prognosis Prediction for Symptomatic Aortic Stenosis and Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Multicenter Cohort Study WANG 2025,Not available,"['Markers Enable Early', 'Enable Early Identification', 'Learning-Driven Markers Enable', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Symptomatic Aortic Stenosis', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Preserved Ejection Fraction', 'Markers Enable', 'Enable Early', 'Early Identification']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['heart failure with preserved ejection fraction', 'interpretable models', 'machine learning', 'major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events.', 'symptomatic aortic stenosis', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"
40308627,Comparative effectiveness of transcatheter vs surgical aortic valve replacement: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: The management of severe symptomatic aortic stenosis has been revolutionized by transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), offering a minimally invasive alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). However, the comparative safety and efficacy of these interventions remain subjects of ongoing investigation.
AIM: To compare the clinical outcomes and safety of TAVR vs SAVR in patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis.
METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing TAVR and SAVR were identified from databases including PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science up to May 31, 2024. Data were extracted on clinical outcomes, including mortality, procedural complications, and post-procedure adverse events. Risk ratios (RRs) with 95%CIs were calculated using a random-effects model.
RESULTS: A total of 10 RCTs were included. TAVR demonstrated a significantly lower risk of acute kidney injury (RR: 0.33; 95%CI: 0.25-0.44), major bleeding (RR: 0.37; 95%CI: 0.30-0.46), and new-onset atrial fibrillation (RR: 0.44; 95%CI: 0.34-0.57) compared to SAVR. However, TAVR was associated with higher risks of new permanent pacemaker implantation (RR: 3.49; 95%CI: 2.77-4.39), major vascular complications (RR: 2.47; 95%CI: 1.91-3.21), and paravalvular leaks (RR: 4.15; 95%CI: 3.14-5.48). Mortality at 30 days was comparable (RR: 0.95; 95%CI: 0.78-1.15), but long-term mortality was slightly higher with TAVR in some analyses (RR: 1.23; 95%CI: 1.01-1.49). Rates of stroke (RR: 0.97; 95%CI: 0.81-1.17) and myocardial infarction (RR: 0.91; 95%CI: 0.67-1.24) were similar between the groups.
CONCLUSION: TAVR offers a less invasive option with significant benefits in reducing acute kidney injury, major bleeding, and new-onset atrial fibrillation, making it particularly advantageous for high-risk surgical candidates. However, higher risks of permanent pacemaker implantation, vascular complications, and paravalvular leaks highlight the need for individualized patient selection and shared decision-making to optimize outcomes.","['Iman Moradi', 'Muhammad Saqlain Mustafa', 'Jannat Sardar Sheikh', 'Behrooz Shojai Rahnama', 'Matthew Fredericks', 'Anil Kumar Yennam', 'Mustafa Arain', 'Utsow Saha', 'Andrew Richard Ma', 'Adithya Nagendran', 'Moosa Bin Omer', 'Muhammad Armaghan', 'Diana Carolina Cortés Jaimes', 'Nagavenkata Lova Surya Vamsi Avinash Bojanki', 'Muhammad Ashir Shafique']",World journal of cardiology,2025-04-26,10.4330/wjc.v17.i4.104168,https://doi.org/10.4330/wjc.v17.i4.104168,PMC12038701,Free,Comparative effectiveness of transcatheter vs surgical aortic valve replacement A systematic review and meta analysis MORADI 2025,pdfs\Comparative effectiveness of transcatheter vs surgical aortic valve replacement A systematic review and meta analysis MORADI 2025.pdf,"['aortic valve replacement', 'Department of Medicine', 'surgical aortic valve', 'aortic valve', 'TAVR', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'aortic', 'valve replacement', 'surgical aortic', 'Muhammad Saqlain Mustafa']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Aortic stenosis', 'Meta-analysis', 'Surgical aortic valve replacement', 'Transcatheter aortic valve replacement', 'Treatment decision-making']"
40308620,Sutureless aortic valve and post-operative atrial fibrillation: Five-year outcomes from a propensity matched cohort study.,"BACKGROUND: The Perceval Sorin S (perceval valve) is a sutureless bioprosthetic designed for use in a high-risk cohort who may not be suitable for transcatheter aortic valve implantation or a conventional surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR).
AIM: To compare five-year post-operative outcomes in a cohort undergoing isolated AVR with the perceval valve to a contemporary cohort undergoing surgical AVR with a sutured bioprosthesis.
METHODS: This study was a retrospective, cohort study at a single tertiary unit. Between 2017 and 2023, 982 suitable patients were identified. 174 Perceval valve replacements were matched to 174 sutured valve replacements. Cohort characteristics, intra-operative details, and post-operative outcomes were compared between the two groups.
RESULTS: Time under the aortic cross-clamp (P < 0.001), time on the cardiopulmonary bypass (P < 0.001) and total operative time (P < 0.001) were significantly reduced in the Perceval group. Patients in the Perceval valve group were at a lower risk of postoperative pneumonia [odds ratio (OR) = 0.53 (0.29-0.94)] and atrial fibrillation [OR = 0.58 (0.36-0.93)]. After propensity-matching, all-cause mortality did not significantly differ between the two groups in the five-year follow-up period. Larger valve sizes conferred an increased risk of mortality (P = 0.020).
CONCLUSION: Sutureless surgical AVR (SAVR) is a safe and efficient alternative to SAVR with a sutured bioprosthesis, and may confer a reduced risk of post-operative atrial fibrillation. Clinician tendency towards 'oversizing' sutureless aortic valves translates into adverse clinical outcomes. Less time on the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit allows for the treatment of otherwise high-risk patients.","['Thomas French', 'Sanjeet Singh Avtaar Singh', 'Vincenzo Giordano', 'Charilaos-Panagiotis Koutsogiannidis', 'Kelvin Hao Han Lim', 'Renzo Pessotto', 'Vipin Zamvar']",World journal of cardiology,2025-04-26,10.4330/wjc.v17.i4.102669,https://doi.org/10.4330/wjc.v17.i4.102669,PMC12038705,Free,Sutureless aortic valve and post operative atrial fibrillation Five year outcomes from a propensity matched cohort study FRENCH 2025,pdfs\Sutureless aortic valve and post operative atrial fibrillation Five year outcomes from a propensity matched cohort study FRENCH 2025.pdf,"['aortic valve', 'Singh Avtaar Singh', 'valve', 'AVR', 'Sutureless aortic valve', 'perceval valve', 'aortic', 'Sanjeet Singh Avtaar', 'Sutureless aortic', 'transcatheter aortic valve']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Aortic valve replacements', 'Atrial fibrillation', 'Survival', 'Sutureless valves']"
40306844,Clinical Impact of Midframe Underexpansion Following TAVR Using a Self-Expanding Transcatheter Heart Valve.,"BACKGROUND: The occurrence and clinical impact of transcatheter heart valve midframe underexpansion following transcatheter aortic valve replacement are not well understood.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate midframe underexpansion among patients treated with the self-expanding ACURATE neo2 device.
METHODS: This retrospective analysis included 604 patients (median age 82 years; Q1-Q3: 78-85 years; 61.4% women) from 2 European high-volume centers. Midframe underexpansion was assessed on postimplantation fluoroscopic images and defined as nonparallelism of commissure posts. The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause mortality, stroke, or rehospitalization at 1 year.
RESULTS: Midframe underexpansion was identified in 13.9% of patients (84 of 604) and was associated with higher rates of the primary endpoint (33 of 84 [39.3%; 95% CI: 28.8%-50.5%] vs 54 of 520 [10.4%; 95% CI: 7.9%-13.3%]; P < 0.001) and each of its components. Furthermore, midframe underexpansion was independently associated with 1-year all-cause mortality (adjusted HR: 4.07; 95% CI: 2.26-7.33; P < 0.001). The only independent predictor of midframe underexpansion was the absence of postdilatation (adjusted OR: 5.76; 95% CI: 2.60-12.77; P < 0.001). Postdilatation significantly decreased the rate and extent of midframe underexpansion.
CONCLUSIONS: In this European cohort of ACURATE neo2 recipients, midframe underexpansion occurred in a minor proportion and was associated with poorer clinical outcomes through 1 year. Postdilatation effectively reduced the rate and extent of midframe underexpansion.","['Won-Keun Kim', 'Ole de Backer', 'Matthias Renker', 'Efstratios I Charitos', 'Chris Frawley', 'Yusuke Kobari', 'Mohamed Abdel-Wahab', 'Ahmed Abdelhafez', 'Niklas Lankisch', 'Darren Mylotte', 'Osama Soliman', 'Michael Joner', 'Helge Möllmann', 'Yeong-Hoon Choi', 'Samuel Sossalla']",JACC.

A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted. PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Web of Science databases were searched for relevant articles up to April 10th, 2024. Studies that reported comparisons of clinical outcomes between PCI before/concomitant with TAVI (PCI-TAVI) vs. TAVI alone, or comparisons between PCI before/concomitant with TAVI vs. PCI after TAVI (TAVI-PCI) were selected. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality in the short-term, mid-term and long-term follow-up. A total of 23 studies pooling 15812 patients were included. Compared to TAVI alone, PCI-TAVI showed no significant difference in all-cause mortality at short- and mid-term (RRshort-term = 1.10 95%CI 0.88-1.38; RRmid-term = 1.12 95%CI 0.97-1.30), but an increase during long-term follow-up (RRlong-term = 1.20 95%CI 1.06-1.36). Compared with PCI-TAVI, TAVI-PCI is associated with lower rate of all-cause mortality at both short- and long-term follow-ups. PCI before or concomitant with TAVI may not offer clinical benefits and could potentially lead to worse outcomes in the long term. Conversely, PCI after TAVI is associated with improved clinical outcomes in both the short and long term.","['Dayang Wang', 'Sijia Lai', 'Zichen Wang', 'Changbo Xuan', 'Xiaoxia Ren', 'Wenhua Peng', 'Guozhong Pan']",PloS one,2025-05-12,10.1371/journal.pone.0321395,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0321395,PMC12043176,Free,Impact of PCI strategies on outcomes of patients undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation with concomitant coronary artery disease A systematic review and meta analysis WANG 2025,pdfs\Impact of PCI strategies on outcomes of patients undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation with concomitant coronary artery disease.pdf,"['PCI', 'Aortic Valve Implantation', 'TAVI', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'undergoing Transcatheter Aortic', 'Aortic Valve', 'Valve Implantation', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'coronary artery disease', 'patients undergoing Transcatheter']",2025-05-12,Pending,[]
40305236,Management of difficult coronary anatomy during transcatheter aortic valve implantation: what are the key issues?,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Predicting and preventing coronary obstruction in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is crucial due to its high mortality risk.
RECENT FINDINGS: In native TAVR, predicting coronary obstruction requires assessing aortic cusp height, coronary artery height, valve-to-coronary distance, and leaflet calcium volume. The VIVID classification has been proposed for evaluating the risk of coronary obstruction in TAVR for failed bioprosthetic surgical valves. After TAVR with the Sapien 3 valve, the feasibility of redo TAVR and coronary access decreases with a shallower implantation of the initial Sapien 3. In redo TAVR of Sapien 3 within an Evolut valve, positioning the Sapien 3 outflow at node 4 improves redo TAVR feasibility and coronary accessibility compared to positioning at nodes 5 or 6. For valve sizing in redo TAVR with Sapien 3, in-vivo CT sizing results in smaller valve sizes than bench sizing, reducing coronary risk and improving redo TAVR feasibility. Leaflet modification and coronary stenting techniques and a dedicated leaflet-splitting device have been proposed to maintain coronary perfusion in high-risk cases.
SUMMARY: Coronary preservation in high-risk TAVR remains a significant challenge, requiring further research into preprocedural planning and leaflet modification strategies.","['Takayuki Onishi', 'Gilbert H L Tang']",Current opinion in cardiology,2025-04-25,10.1097/HCO.0000000000001229,https://doi.org/10.1097/HCO.0000000000001229,,Paid,Management of difficult coronary anatomy during transcatheter aortic valve implantation what are the key issues?

40301470,Risk factors and prognosis of silent cerebral infarction after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.,"The Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC)-3 definition of silent cerebral infarction among neurologic events after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) lacks clinical validation, yet its impact on postoperative in-hospital outcomes and long-term prognosis remains uncertain. This study aims to explore the perioperative related factors influencing the risk of SCI post-TAVR as defined by VARC-3 criteria, so as to identify high-risk individuals early and assess the effect of SCI on patient outcomes and one-year mortality following TAVR. This was a single-center study including 613 patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing TAVR, with all data collected prospectively in a dedicated database.We compared clinical baseline data, preoperative imaging results, perioperative factors, and intraoperative variables between patients with and without SCI according to VARC-3. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify risk factors associated with SCI. Propensity score matching (PSM) at a 1:2 ratio was employed based on fundamental characteristics such as age, gender, BMI, and medical history to minimize potential confounding. Post-matching, we analyzed differences in postoperative in-hospital outcomes and other results between the two groups. Survival times were compared using the Kaplan-Meier method, and survival curves were plotted. The log-rank test assessed statistical differences between the survival curves. Furthermore, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were conducted to determine risk factors for one-year postoperative mortality. Out of 827 TAVR patients screened, 613 were included in the final analysis-471 in the SCI group and 142 in the non-SCI group-resulting in an incidence rate of 76.8% for SCI. The occurrence of post-induction hypotension was significantly higher in the SCI group compared to the non-SCI group (70.28% vs. 61.27%, P = 0.043). Multivariate logistic regression revealed that post-induction hypotension lasting less than 10 min (odds ratio [OR]: 1.73; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.13-3.26; P = 0.009), hypotension lasting more than 10 min (OR: 1.98; 95% CI: 1.18-3.33; P = 0.01), and postoperative tachyarrhythmia (OR: 1.98; 95% CI: 1.27-3.07; P = 0.002) were significant risk factors for developing SCI after TAVR. Following 1:2 PSM, 416 patients remained-274 in the SCI group and 142 in the non-SCI group. After matching, the SCI group had a notably higher incidence of postoperative delirium compared to the non-SCI group (9.12% vs. 2.82%; P = 0.017), and their one-year mortality rate was also elevated (5.47% vs. 0.70%; P = 0.016). Additionally, multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that elevated preoperative creatinine levels (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.01; 95% CI: 1.01-1.02; P = 0.011), presence of SCI (HR: 10.81; 95% CI: 1.31-89.18; P = 0.027), Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) score greater than 7% (HR: 3.32; 95% CI: 1.07-10.33; P < 0.038), age 75 years or older (HR: 7.86; 95% CI: 1.01-14.47; P = 0.049), and a history of stroke (HR: 7.20; 95% CI: 2.32-22.35; P < 0.001) were independent risk factors for one-year mortality post-TAVR. Our findings suggest that post-induction hypotension and postoperative tachyarrhythmia are significant risk factors for SCI following TAVR as defined by VARC-3 criteria. Patients who developed SCI after TAVR exhibited higher rates of postoperative delirium and increased one-year mortality compared to those without this complication. Furthermore, factors such as elevated preoperative creatinine levels, an STS score above 7%, age of 75 years or older, and a prior history of stroke were associated with higher one-year mortality rates after TAVR. Given the negative impact of occult SCI on clinical outcomes, every effort should be made to reduce the risk of neurological complications after TAVR.","['Shuguang Wu', 'Yi Liu', 'Tingting Ni', 'Tao Lv', 'Yuanyuan Yao', 'Min Yan']",Scientific reports,2025-04-29,10.1038/s41598-025-99173-8,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-99173-8,PMC12041380,Free,Risk factors and prognosis of silent cerebral infarction after transcatheter aortic valve replacement WU 2025,pdfs\Risk factors and prognosis of silent cerebral infarction after transcatheter aortic valve replacement WU 2025.pdf,"['SCI', 'TAVR', 'SCI group', 'Risk factors', 'SCI group compared', 'silent cerebral infarction', 'factors', 'Risk', 'Academic Research Consortium', 'transcatheter aortic valve']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Clinical outcomes', 'Mortality', 'Postoperative delirium', 'Risk factors', 'Silent cerebral infarction', 'Transcatheter aortic valve replacement', 'VARC-3']"

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of a comprehensive, minimalistic approach to TAVI utilizing all available devices in all-comers, real-world population.
METHODS: This is a prospective, single-center, single-arm clinical study. The primary endpoint of the study was a composite of 30-day all-cause mortality, disabling stroke, major bleedings, major vascular complications, stage 3 acute kidney injury (AKI), and permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI). Outcomes were compared to those of an historical cohort of patients undergoing TAVI following a standard approach, by selecting pairs of patients selected through a 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM). A cost analysis of TAVI hospitalization was performed considering costs related to procedural complications and post-procedural length of stay (LoS).
RESULTS: Between January 2020 and December 2023, a total of 997 patients underwent TAVI following an optimized, minimalistic pathway. Device success was reported in 88.2% patients, with low procedural complications. The primary endpoint occurred in 21.1% of patients. After PSM, TAVI patients following the minimalistic pathway had higher device success (91.4% vs 84.2%, p = 0.004), and lower major vascular complications (4.5% vs. 10.3%, p = 0.004) compared to those following the standard approach. Median LoS was shorter (1.0 day vs. 2.0 days, p < 0.001) and the rate of next-day discharge was higher (46.7% vs. 19.0%, p < 0.001) in patients following the minimalistic pathway, with lower hospitalization costs (median € 2200 vs. 3150; p < 0.001). At 30-day, the primary endpoint was significantly lower in patients following the minimalistic pathway (17.2% vs 23.9%, p = 0.034).

40301223,Long-term outcome of bail-out ViV-TAVI at index procedure.,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare in-hospital and long-term outcomes of patients with bail-out valve-in-valve TAVI due to a primarily failed transcatheter aortic valves procedure (bViV-TAVI) versus a successful transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).
METHODS: We recorded bViV-TAVI procedures at our center from February 2011 to March 2022. Primary endpoint was long-term mortality. In-hospital mortality, stroke, acute kidney failure, need for new permanent pacemaker, and duration of intervention were secondary endpoints.
RESULTS: 4555 patients undergoing TAVI were retrospectively included. 231 matched (77:154) patients were analyzed. BViV-TAVI was a rare event (1.9%). In 76.7% of the cases transcatheter valve embolization and migration were the reasons for implanting a second valve in the same procedure. Significant PVL accounted for bViV-TAVI in 23.4% of the patients. The duration of the intervention was significantly longer for the bViV-TAVI group (p < 0.001). BViV-TAVI patients showed higher rates of a new permanent pacemaker implantation (p = 0.013) and the postprocedural mean pressure was significantly higher (p = 0.03). Concerning the other secondary endpoints there was a trend for a higher event rate in bVIV-TAVI patients which did not reach significant difference. After an average follow-up period of 4.9 ± 3.0 years, mortality was significantly higher in the bViV-TAVI group (54.5% vs. 39.0%, p = 0.025).
CONCLUSION: The implantation of a second valve during the same procedure as bail-out is a feasible alternative treatment option in patients with failed transcatheter aortic valve procedures. However, increased long-term mortality must be taken into account.","['Isabel Horn', 'Hazem Omran', 'Sabine Bleiziffer', 'Smita Scholtz', 'Kai Friedrichs', 'Cornelia Piper', 'Johanna Bormann', 'Sara Waezsada', 'Max Potratz', 'René Schramm', 'Volker Rudolph', 'Tanja K Rudolph']",Clinical research in cardiology : official journal of the German Cardiac Society,2025-04-29,10.1007/s00392-025-02640-5,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00392-025-02640-5,PMC10984572,Free,Long term outcome of bail out ViV TAVI at index procedure HORN 2025,pdfs\Long term outcome of bail out ViV TAVI at index procedure HORN 2025.pdf,"['aortic valve', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'surgical aortic valve', 'aortic valve implantation', 'valve', 'severe aortic valve', 'aortic', 'TAVI', 'bioprosthetic aortic valves', 'aortic valve stenosis']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Aortic stenosis', 'Bailout', 'Conversion', 'Embolization', 'Migration', 'TAVI', 'Valve-in-valve']"
40298371,AI-based prediction of left bundle branch block risk post-TAVI using pre-implantation clinical parameters.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) has revolutionized the treatment of severe aortic stenosis. Although its clinical efficacy is well established, the development of new-onset left bundle branch block (LBBB) following TAVI remains a frequent and concerning complication. This study aims to develop pre-implantation predictive models for new-onset LBBB after TAVI using both conventional machine learning (ML) algorithms and Large Language Models (LLMs).
METHODS: Of the 1113 patients who underwent TAVI over a 15-year period, 469 were included after excluding those with preexisting LBBB, pacing rhythm, or missing relevant data. Pre-procedural clinical parameters - such as valve type, valve size, patient demographics, and comorbidities - were analyzed. The dataset was split into training and testing sets. Several ML algorithms were employed, and performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, and F1 score. Additionally, LLMs (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) were assessed using Few-Shot and Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting.
RESULTS: New-onset persistent LBBB occurred in 15.29% of patients. Among ML models, XGBoost performed best. GPT-4 with CoT prompting demonstrated superior predictive performance compared to both conventional ML and GPT-3.5.
CONCLUSIONS: The current study establishes a predictive model leveraging pre-implantation parameters to anticipate the occurrence of new-onset left bundle branch block (LBBB) post-Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI).
Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) is a less invasive procedure used to treat patients with severe narrowing of the aortic valve. While it has significantly improved patient outcomes, some individuals develop a new heart rhythm problem called left bundle branch block (LBBB) after the procedure. LBBB can affect the heart’s electrical system and, in some cases, lead to complications such as the need for a permanent pacemaker.This study aimed to predict which patients are most likely to develop LBBB before the TAVR procedure by using artificial intelligence (AI) models. We analyzed data from 469 patients and tested different machine learning techniques, including traditional AI models and large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4. Our results showed that XGBoost, a machine learning algorithm, was the most accurate in predicting LBBB risk, while GPT-4 performed well when prompted using a specific reasoning approach (Chain of Thought method).These findings suggest that AI models can help identify high-risk patients before the procedure, allowing doctors to make better treatment decisions. However, further studies with larger patient groups are needed to confirm the accuracy of these predictions and improve personalized care for TAVR patients.","['Cheilas Vasileios', 'Filandrianos Giorgos', 'Martinos Antonios', 'Kostopoulou Anna']",Future cardiology,2025-04-29,10.1080/14796678.2025.2498866,https://doi.org/10.1080/14796678.2025.2498866,,Paid,AI based prediction of left bundle branch block risk post TAVI using pre implantation clinical parameters VASILEIOS 2025,Not available,"['Aortic Valve Implantation', 'left bundle branch', 'LBBB', 'Aortic Valve', 'bundle branch block', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'TAVI', 'bundle branch', 'Valve', 'Valve Implantation']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['LLMs', 'Transcatheter aortic valve replacement', 'aortic stenosis', 'artificial intelligence', 'individualized risk assessment', 'left bundle branch block', 'pre implantation predictors']"
40297162,"Current hotspot and study trend of transcatheter aortic valve replacement, a bibliometric analysis from 2009 to 2023.","INTRODUCTION: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), alternatively termed transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), represents a seminal advancement in cardiovascular interventions by obviating the necessity for open-heart surgery traditionally associated with surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). This technique entails percutaneous delivery of a bioprosthetic valve. Despite the surfeit of literature on TAVR over the past fifteen years, a bibliometric analysis is conspicuously absent.
METHOD: A query executed on the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) on September 1, 2022, returned 8,359 articles and reviews pertinent to TAVR. Data interpretation leveraged Microsoft Excel, CiteSpace, and VOSviewer to illustrate trends and delineate focal points within the corpus of TAVR research.
RESULT: The analysis incorporated 8,359 articles and reviews on TAVR from January 1, 2009, to August 1, 2023. Publication volume expanded from 35 in 2009 to a pinnacle in 2020, reflecting a near thirty folds increase, with citations escalating from 56 in 2009 to 27,354 in 2021. The United States prevailed in scholarly output (Np = 3,015), citation frequency (Nc = 70,991, excluding self-citations), and academic impact (H-index = 120). Columbia University was distinguished by the highest number of publications (Np = 380), citations (Nc = 41,051), and H-index (84).

40295400,Experience with a Large-Bore Vascular Closure Device in Patients Undergoing a Percutaneous Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (EVAR): A Multicentre Study.,"PURPOSE: Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is the preferred treatment for infrarenal aortic aneurysms, offering lower perioperative morbidity and mortality compared to open surgery. Common femoral artery (CFA) access can be achieved percutaneously or through surgical cutdown, with a percutaneous approach gaining more and more popularity. The MANTA vascular closure device (VCD), a collagen plug-based device, has shown promising results in transcatheter aortic valve replacement, but data on its use in percutaneous EVAR (pEVAR), particularly in obese patients, remain limited.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective study included all patients who underwent pEVAR from October 2018 to December 2022 across three Dutch hospitals and in whom the MANTA VCD has been applied. Patient demographics, perioperative characteristics, and clinical outcomes were recorded. Subgroup analysis was performed based on body mass index (BMI), comparing outcomes in obese (BMI ≥ 30) and non-obese (BMI < 30) patients. Technical success and access site complications were primary and secondary outcomes, respectively.
RESULTS: A total of 549 patients (mean age 75.16 ± 7.09 years, 88.9% male) were included, with 140 classified as obese. The MANTA VCD was used in 1024 CFAs. Overall technical success, defined as vascular closure with patent CFA, without requiring immediate surgery, was 98%, with a 3.1% complication rate, primarily due to closure failure. In obese patients, technical success was 98.9%, with a 1.5% complication rate, showing comparable outcomes to non-obese patients.
CONCLUSION: The MANTA VCD is effective and safe for CFA closure in pEVAR, including in obese patients. Given rising obesity rates, the favorable outcomes in this population are encouraging and suggesting a broader applicability in large-bore percutaneous procedures.","['Jacob Michiels', 'Maxim Peeters', 'Martine Uittenbogaart', 'Rens Oosterveld', 'Lucas Bloo', 'Maarten Loos', 'Lee Bouwman', 'Roel Janssen', 'Jan-Willem Elshof', 'Ozan Yazar']",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,2025-04-28,10.1007/s00270-025-04040-8,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00270-025-04040-8,PMC9790995,Free,Experience with a Large Bore Vascular Closure Device in Patients Undergoing a Percutaneous Endovascular Aneurysm Repair EVAR A Multicentre Study MICHIELS 2025,pdfs\Experience with a Large Bore Vascular Closure Device in Patients Undergoing a Percutaneous Endovascular Aneurysm Repair EVAR A Multicentre S.pdf,"['Endovascular Aneurysm Repair', 'aortic valve', 'biCuspId aortic valve', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'Percutaneous Endovascular Aneurysm', 'aortic valve replacement', 'Endovascular Aneurysm', 'valve', 'THV', 'coronary']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['EVAR', 'Endovascular aneurysm repair', 'MANTA vascular closure device', 'Obesity', 'Percutaneous closure', 'Vascular surgery']"
40295134,"Evaluation of the efficacy of angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor in patients with aortic stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation: protocol for a randomised, open-label, controlled study.","INTRODUCTION: There are a substantial number of patients developing heart failure after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) for severe aortic stenosis (AS), even though AS has been successfully treated. The purpose of this randomised controlled trial was to determine whether the addition of an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), sacubitril/valsartan, is superior to conventional medications in lowering N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels in patients undergoing TAVI for AS.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study design is a prospective, single-centre, open-label, randomised, parallel-group, two-arm study, in which participants will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either conventional medications plus ARNI or conventional medications only. In the ARNI group, if a patient was on an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker before TAVI, it will be switched to ARNI 100 mg/day (50 mg two times per day) on the first postoperative day. If not, candesartan 4 mg/day will be started 1-2 days before TAVI, and switched to ARNI 100 mg/day on the first postoperative day. As the patient has tolerability to ARNI, dosage will be increased stepwise to 400 mg/day 2-4 weeks apart. ARNI will be continued until at least 6-month follow-up. In the control group, the patient will receive conventional medications. The primary endpoint is the serum NT-proBNP value at 6-month follow-up after TAVI. Each group includes 42 patients (84 total patients).
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval for this study has been obtained from the Chiba University Hospital Certified Clinical Research Review Board (CRB3180015). The study is ongoing. Findings from this study will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations.

40293726,Transcatheter aortic valve implantation versus surgery in low-risk patients: in-hospital and mid-term outcomes.,"OBJECTIVES: aim of our study is to compare post procedural outcomes and mid-term mortality of low-risk patients treated by transfemoral TAVI or surgical AVR for severe aortic stenosis.
METHODS: Data of consecutive patients undergoing AVR or TAVI from 09/2017 to 12/2021 were prospectively collected and retrospectively reviewed. Eligible patients were aged between 75 and 85 years with low-surgical risk and isolated severe aortic stenosis. Exclusion criteria were prior heart surgery, valve-in-valve procedure, and the need for concomitant procedures. The primary end-point was mid-term all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: 351 patients were enrolled. 243 underwent TAVI and 108 underwent AVR. Compared to AVR, TAVI patients were older (82 [78-83 ] vs 78 [77-80], p < 0.001), with higher incidence of advanced CKD (33.3% vs 15.7%, p < 0,001) and poor mobility (15.6% vs 5.6%, p = 0.008) and a higher Euroscore II (2.2 [1.72-2.98] vs 1.9 [1.31-2.46 ], p = 0.002). AVR patients had a higher incidence of post-procedural AKI (29.6% vs 4.5%, p < 0.001), while TAVI patients had a higher incidence of LBBB (23.9% vs 1.8%, p < 0.001) and at least mild to moderate PVL (4.5% vs 0%, p = 0.021). Mid- term mortality was higher among TAVI patients (HR 0.38 [95% CI 0.23-0.88], p = 0.020). In the matched cohort TAVI had a higher incidence of LBBB (11.5% vs 1.3%, p = 0.018) and permanent PM implantation (12.8% vs 5.1%, p = 0.041), while AVR patients had a higher incidence of post-procedural AKI (33.3% vs 5.1%, p < 0.001). Mid-term mortality was higher in TAVI patients (HR 0.36 [95% CI 0.21-0.87], p = 0.019).

40291824,The impact of ascending aorta dilatation on transcatheter aortic valve implantation outcomes.,"The impact of ascending aorta dilatation (AAD) on transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) outcomes, compared to non-AAD, remains unclear. This meta-analysis aims to compare the outcomes of TAVI between patients with and without AAD. We systematically searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Springer, Cochrane, and Clinicaltrials.gov. for articles up to 25 March 2024 (PROSPERO ID CRD42024526311). A total of 204,078 patients from ten studies were included. Paravalvular regurgitation (RR 1.56 95 %CI: 1.32-1.84, p < 0.00001, I2 = 0 %) and aortic dissection (RR 3.55 95 %CI: 1.79-7.06, p = 0.0003, I2 = 40 %) were more common in AAD group. However, there were no differences in peri-procedural (RR 1.09, 95 %CI: 0.83-1.42, p = 0.53, I2 = 0 %) and 1-year (RR 0.79, 95 %CI: 0.51-1.23, p = 0.30, I2 = 0 %) mortality. Three-years (RR 0.88, 95 %CI: 0.54-1.44, p = 0.62) and five-years (RR 0.85, 95 %CI: 0.45-1.6, p = 0.61) follow-up showed comparable mortality between both groups. The other complications and the need for second valve implantation (RR 1.24, 95 %CI: 0.70-20.20, p = 0.48, I2 = 65 %) were similar between both groups. Despite the higher incidence of aortic dissection and paravalvular regurgitation in AAD than in non-AAD patients, these complications were not associated with worse short-term or long-term mortality.

CASE SUMMARY: An 86-year-old female with severe aortic and mitral regurgitation was admitted due to acute pulmonary oedema, rapidly deteriorating in cardiogenic shock refractory to medical treatment. Haemodynamic stabilization was achieved only after implantation of an Impella CP, through a trans-femoral approach. Considering the prohibitive surgical risk, the mitral valve regurgitation was treated with a transcatheter edge-to-edge repair procedure, which allowed to successfully wean the patient from Impella. Subsequently, a transcatheter aortic valve implantation was performed. The patient's clinical status improved to such a level that a rehabilitation program was successfully implemented.
DISCUSSION: Our report shows that an entirely percutaneous approach, to manage a combined severe aortic and mitral regurgitation, complicated by cardiogenic shock, is feasible and effective.","['Francesco Lo Iudice', 'Amelia Ravera', 'Alfonso Campanile', 'Stefano Romei', 'Francesco Vigorito']",European heart journal.

40289515,Vascular Closure Devices for Large Bore Femoral Access After Transfemoral Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: A Network Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Large-bore femoral access is commonly required in transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TF-TAVR), but vascular access complications remain prevalent, impacting patient outcomes. Various vascular closure devices (VCDs) are used for hemostasis, including the suture-based Prostar XL, Perclose ProGlide, and ProStyle, and the plug-based MANTA device. However, comprehensive comparative evidence on these VCDs, particularly single Perclose strategies, is lacking.
METHODS: A systematic review and network meta-analysis were conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. We included randomized and observational studies comparing the safety and efficacy of VCDs for large-bore femoral access closure in TF-TAVR patients. Primary outcomes included major vascular complications; secondary outcomes included major and minor bleeding, minor vascular complications, VCD failure, and all-cause mortality. Frequentist and Bayesian analyses were performed using a random-effects model, with additional subgroup analyses of single Perclose strategies.
RESULTS: Thirty-five studies comprising 16,503 patients met inclusion criteria. The single Perclose strategy, with or without adjunct Angio-Seal or FemoSeal, significantly reduced major vascular complications compared to dual Perclose (RR: 1.9, 95% CI [1.2-3.01]), MANTA (RR: 1.89, 95% CI [1.03-3.48]), and Prostar XL (RR: 3.46, 95% CI [1.94-6.18]). Among secondary outcomes, single Perclose also ranked highest in reducing minor complications and bleeding.
CONCLUSION: Single Perclose strategies, especially when combined with Angio-Seal, demonstrated superior safety and efficacy for large-bore femoral access closure following TF-TAVR. These findings support the need for further randomized trials to validate single Perclose as a primary approach in TF-TAVR vascular closure.","['Sunil Upadhaya', 'Alina Upreti', 'Kunal Gupta', 'Bella Gonzalez-Perez', 'Radia Ksayer', 'Pedro Cox-Alomar', 'Cristina Sanina', 'Anand Irimpen', 'Serdar Farhan', 'Jose Wiley']",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,2025-04-27,10.1002/ccd.31565,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.31565,,Paid,Vascular Closure Devices for Large Bore Femoral Access After Transfemoral Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement A Network Meta Analysis UPADHAYA 2025,Not available,"['Large Bore Femoral', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Transfemoral Transcatheter Aortic', 'Large Bore', 'Bore Femoral Access', 'Valve Replacement', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'Aortic Valve', 'Transfemoral Transcatheter']",2025-05-12,Pending,[]

40288578,Comparative Effectiveness and Safety of Self-Expanding Versus Balloon-Expandable Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a safe alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement for patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis at increased surgical risk. However, comparative data on self-expanding valves (SEV) versus balloon-expanding valves (BEV) remain limited.
METHODS: A comprehensive review of PubMed and Embase was conducted through April 2024, identifying eight studies (five randomized controlled trials and three propensity-matched observational studies) comparing SEV and BEV in TAVR. Primary outcomes included all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and device success per Valve Academic Research Consortium criteria, while secondary outcomes assessed bioprosthetic valve dysfunction and adverse events (annulus rupture/dissection, coronary artery occlusion, valve dislocation/embolization, valve thrombosis, moderate and severe paravalvular aortic regurgitation, endocarditis, permanent pacemaker implantation, major or life-threatening bleeding, acute kidney injury, and stroke).
RESULTS: The analysis included 4,032 patients (SEV = 2,006; BEV = 2,017). SEV was associated with higher rates of moderate-to-severe paravalvular aortic regurgitation [OR, 1.76; CI 1.13-2.74; P = 0.01] and permanent pacemaker placement [OR, 1.57; CI, 1.23-2.00; P = 0.0002] compared to BEV. No significant differences were observed in 30-day or 1-year all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, device success, bioprosthetic valve dysfunction, valve dislocation/embolization, valve thrombosis, endocarditis, major or life-threatening bleeding, coronary artery occlusion, stroke, rehospitalization, or acute kidney injury.

40287133,"Temporal Trends in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Outcomes in Patients With Low-Flow, Low-Gradient Aortic Stenosis: Insights From the TOPAS-TAVI Registry.","BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) technology and techniques have continuously improved, but data on their impact in low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis (LFLG-AS) remain limited. In particular, scarce data exist comparing the results of TAVR with new-generation devices vs early-generation devices in these patients. This study evaluated the temporal trends in TAVR practices among LFLG-AS patients.
METHODS: This multicentre registry included 424 consecutive LFLG-AS patients undergoing TAVR from 2007 to 2023, stratified by device generation: new-generation devices (n = 193) and early-generation devices (n = 231). All-cause mortality or heart failure hospitalisation (HFH) at 1-year follow-up was the primary end point.
RESULTS: The median Society of Thoracic Surgeons score was lower in the new-generation group (5.3% [interquartile range [IQR] 3.4%-8.2%] vs 7.4% [IQR 5.0%-12.1%]; P < 0.001), whereas left ventricular ejection fractions(LVEFs) were similar (new: 31.2 ± 8.3%; early: 30.0 ± 8.8%; P = 0.16). New-generation devices were associated with a significant reduction in moderate-to-severe paravalvular leak after TAVR (2.6% vs 9.1%; P = 0.005), but 30-day mortality was similar (new: 1.6%; early: 3.9%; P = 0.15). At 1 year, new-generation devices were associated with a greater LVEF improvement (43.8 ± 12.5% vs 39.8 ± 11.5%; P = 0.003), but without a significant reduction in all-cause mortality or HFH (new: 23.8%; early: 28.1%; P = 0.32). Chronic kidney disease and low hemoglobin independently predicted worse outcomes (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite procedural improvements with new-generation TAVR devices, clinical outcomes in LFLG-AS patients remain suboptimal. LVEF significantly improved after TAVR with new-generation devices but failed to translate into improved clinical outcomes. These findings suggest that TAVR alone may not suffice in this population and underscore the need for a comprehensive therapeutic approach that integrates TAVR with optimised medical management and cardiac rehabilitation.","['Siddhartha Mengi', 'Luis Nombela-Franco', 'Pedro Cepas-Guillén', 'Stamatios Lerakis', 'Raj Makkar', 'Tarun Chakravarty', 'Vassilis Babaliaros', 'Henrique Barbosa Ribeiro', 'Emilie Pelletier-Beaumont', 'Philippe Pibarot', 'Josep Rodés-Cabau']",The Canadian journal of cardiology,2025-04-24,10.1016/j.cjca.2025.04.015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2025.04.015,,Paid,Temporal Trends in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Outcomes in Patients With Low Flow Low Gradient Aortic Stenosis Insights From the TOPAS TAVI Registry MENGI 2025,Not available,"['Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Low-Gradient Aortic Stenosis', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'Aortic Stenosis', 'Aortic Valve', 'Valve Replacement', 'Low-Gradient Aortic', 'Valve Replacement Outcomes', 'TAVR']",2025-05-12,Pending,[]
40286377,Human Epididymis Protein 4 in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation: Diagnostic and Prognostic Value.,"BACKGROUND: The utility of the human epididymis protein 4 (HE4) in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has not been established yet.
OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed at examining the prognostic value of HE4 in patients undergoing TAVI.
METHODS: In this prospective study, the prognostic value of HE4 to predict adverse clinical events was evaluated in 362 patients who underwent TAVI. The association between HE4 and diffuse myocardial fibrosis was also assessed using T1 mapping on cardiac magnetic resonance in a subgroup of 43 patients.
RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 2.5 (IQR: 1.9-3.2) years, 34/362 (9.4%) patients were rehospitalized for heart failure, 99/362 (27.3%) died, and 113/362 (31.2%) met the composite endpoint of rehospitalization for heart failure or all-cause mortality. In multivariable Cox regression analyses, patients with higher HE4 serum levels (ie, HE4 ≥130 pmol/L) vs lower serum levels (ie, HE4 <130 pmol/L) had increased risk of all-cause mortality (adjusted HR: 3.26 [95% CI: 2.04-5.20], P < 0.001), and of the composite endpoint (adjusted HR: 2.48 [95% CI: 1.64-3.74], P < 0.001) following TAVI, respectively. Patients with higher HE4 serum levels had higher median native T1 mapping values (1,278 [95% CI: 1,239-1,280] ms vs 1,352 [95% CI: 1,303-1,376] ms, P < 0.001) at 1 to 3 months following the procedure.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated HE4 serum levels are associated with diffuse myocardial fibrosis and increased risk of adverse clinical events following TAVI.

40283668,Review Article: Contemporary Transcatheter Heart Valves for TAVI in Bicuspid Aortic Anatomy.,"Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most common congenital heart disease, affecting 0.5-2% of the population and often leading to early aortic valve degeneration. While surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) remains the gold standard for treating severe bicuspid aortic stenosis (AS), transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is emerging as a viable alternative in selected BAV anatomies. Initial experiences with first-generation transcatheter heart valves (THVs) showed the feasibility of this technique, but were associated with lower device success rates and higher complications, such as paravalvular leak (PVL) and pacemaker implantation. Advancements in second- and third- generation THVs, together with better pre-procedural imaging assessment and growing operator experience, have significantly enhanced TAVI outcomes in BAV patients, with results now comparable to those seen in tricuspid aortic valves (TAVs). Proper patient selection, pre-procedural sizing, and device implantation are key to improving TAVI success in BAV. Recent registry data on contemporary THV platforms demonstrate improved procedural success, hemodynamic performance, and the safety of TAVI in BAV. However, higher rates of PVL, pacemaker implantation, and strokes remain concerns. Ongoing advancements in THV design and procedural techniques will further enhance outcomes for this challenging population. Up to the present, there are no dedicated THVs for BAV, but the latest-generation THVs offer promising results.","['Chrysavgi Simopoulou', 'Omar Oliva', 'Vincenzo Cesario', 'Nicolas Dumonteil', 'Didier Tchetche', 'Chiara De Biase']",Journal of clinical medicine,2025-04-20,10.3390/jcm14082838,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm14082838,PMC12027816,Free,Review Article Contemporary Transcatheter Heart Valves for TAVI in Bicuspid Aortic Anatomy SIMOPOULOU 2025,pdfs\Review Article Contemporary Transcatheter Heart Valves for TAVI in Bicuspid Aortic Anatomy SIMOPOULOU 2025.pdf,"['aortic valve', 'BAV', 'TAVI', 'Bicuspid aortic valve', 'Transcatheter Heart Valves', 'Bicuspid Aortic', 'Aortic', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'aortic valve implantation', 'valve']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['balloon-expandable valve (BEV)', 'bicuspid aortic valve (BAV)', 'paravalvular leak (PVL)', 'permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI)', 'self-expanding valve (SEV)', 'transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI)']"
40283648,Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Reverses Heyde Syndrome: A Case Report of Severe Aortic Stenosis and Gastrointestinal Bleeding.,"Background: Heyde syndrome is a rare condition characterized by the triad of severe aortic stenosis, gastrointestinal bleeding, and acquired type 2A von Willebrand syndrome. This case report highlights the diagnostic and therapeutic approach for a 72-year-old woman presenting with exertional chest pain, dyspnea, fatigue, and a history of melena. Methods: The diagnostic workup revealed severe microcytic anemia and a reduced vWF ristocetin-to-antigen ratio. Imaging confirmed severe degenerative aortic stenosis, while video capsule endoscopy identified angiodysplasia and telangiectasias in the small bowel as the source of gastrointestinal bleeding. Following evaluation by a multidisciplinary Heart Team, the patient underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with an Evolut Fx self-expanding prosthesis. Results: Post-procedural echocardiography showed mild paravalvular regurgitation. The patient's clinical course was favorable, with resolution of anemia and no further gastrointestinal bleeding episodes. Conclusions: Heyde syndrome requires a high index of suspicion for diagnosis in patients with severe aortic stenosis and unexplained anemia or gastrointestinal bleeding. TAVR offers an effective treatment option that not only resolves valvular pathology, but also mitigates associated bleeding risks.","['Claudiu Florin Rășinar', 'Alexandru Tîrziu', 'Rebeca Ionela Rășinar', 'Florin Gîru', 'Cristian Mornoș', 'Dan Gaiță', 'Constantin Tudor Luca', 'Daniel Miron Brie']",Journal of clinical medicine,2025-04-19,10.3390/jcm14082819,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm14082819,PMC12027620,Free,Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Reverses Heyde Syndrome A Case Report of Severe Aortic Stenosis and Gastrointestinal Bleeding RĂȘINAR 2025,pdfs\Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Reverses Heyde Syndrome A Case Report of Severe Aortic Stenosis and Gastrointestinal Bleeding RINAR 2.pdf,"['Severe Aortic Stenosis', 'Aortic Stenosis', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Gastrointestinal Bleeding', 'Aortic Valve', 'Aortic', 'Heyde Syndrome', 'Severe Aortic', 'Replacement Reverses Heyde']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Heyde syndrome', 'acquired von Willebrand syndrome', 'angiodysplasia', 'aortic stenosis', 'gastrointestinal bleeding', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR)', 'video capsule endoscopy (VCE)', 'von Willebrand factor (vWF)']"
40283600,Redo-Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Procedural Optimization and Patient Selection: From Bench to Clinical Practice.,"With recent guidelines expanding transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) to younger patients, indications for redo-TAVR will also likely increase. When compared with TAVR, redo-TAVR is a rare and novel procedure. Current clinical data derived from registries suggest excellent safety, with low rates of 30-day and 1-year mortality following redo-TAVR. Proper understanding of data from bench studies regarding optimal valve configurations, of patient anatomy and of the technical properties of transcatheter heart valves (THV) is essential for patient selection and procedural success. Lifetime management of redo-TAVR should start before the index procedure, as the choice of the index THV has a major impact on the feasibility of redo-TAVR. Procedural optimization by adequate valve sizing, commissural alignment and adequate implant depth of both index and redo-THV are critical determinants of optimal hemodynamics for maximized valve longevity, as well as lifelong coronary access.","['Ruxandra I Sava', 'Philippe Garot', 'Hakim Benamer', 'Emmanuel Gall', 'Théo Pezel', 'Morad Djebbar', 'Neila Sayah', 'David Meier', 'Georgios Tzimas', 'Jérôme Garot', 'Florence Leclercq', 'Mariama Akodad']",Journal of clinical medicine,2025-04-17,10.3390/jcm14082770,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm14082770,PMC12027932,Free,Redo Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Procedural Optimization and Patient Selection From Bench to Clinical Practice SAVA 2025,pdfs\Redo Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Procedural Optimization and Patient Selection From Bench to Clinical Practice SAVA 2025.pdf,"['Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Valve', 'Valve Replacement Procedural', 'Valve Replacement', 'Aortic Valve', 'redo-TAVR', 'Patient Selection', 'bench studies', 'Redo-Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Patient']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['CT predictors', 'TAV-in-TAV', 'coronary access', 'coronary alignment']"
40283521,Aortic Stenosis: Time for a Sex-Based Approach?,"Aortic stenosis (AS) is a progressive form of valvular heart disease most commonly associated with aging, with an exponential increase in prevalence after age 50. While men have historically been considered at higher risk, recent studies highlight a similar prevalence between men and women, with a higher prevalence in elderly women driven by longer life expectancy. Sex-related differences in clinical presentation, anatomy, and pathophysiology influence disease progression, severity assessment, and management. Women are often diagnosed at more advanced stages, exhibiting more pronounced symptoms, typically dyspnea and functional impairment, whereas men more often report chest pain. Women have a smaller body surface area, leading to smaller aortic annuli, left ventricular outflow tracts, aortic roots impacting flow dynamic, and severity grading. Diagnostic challenge contributes to the undertreatment of women. Despite experiencing severe AS, women receive fewer interventions and face delays in treatment. The advent of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) improved outcomes, with studies suggesting a potential advantage in women compared to men. However, the anatomical differences, such as smaller annuli and more tortuous vascular access, necessitate tailored procedural approaches. Recognizing these sex-specific differences is essential to optimizing AS management, ensuring timely interventions, and improving patient outcomes. Future strategies should incorporate sex-specific thresholds for diagnosis and treatment while leveraging technological advancements, such as artificial intelligence, for personalized therapeutic decisions.","['Aurelia Zimmerli', 'Quentin Liabot', 'Georgios Tzimas', 'Mariama Akodad', 'Adil Salihu', 'Victor Weerts', 'Panagiotis Antiochos', 'Stephanie L Sellers', 'Pierre Monney', 'Olivier Muller', 'Stephane Fournier', 'David Meier']",Journal of clinical medicine,2025-04-15,10.3390/jcm14082691,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm14082691,PMC12028251,Free,Aortic Stenosis Time for a Sex Based Approach?

40283481,A Tale of Two Diseases: Decoding Aortic Stenosis and Cardiac Amyloidosis.,"Background/Objectives: Transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR-CA) is an infiltrative cardiomyopathy caused by transthyretin (TTR) amyloid deposition in the myocardium, increasingly recognized in patients with aortic stenosis (AS). This study aims to investigate the diagnostic challenges and therapeutic strategies for patients with both conditions, focusing on shared pathophysiological mechanisms and key diagnostic indicators. Methods: A multimodal diagnostic approach was applied, utilizing cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) and bone scintigraphy with technetium-99m-labeled tracers to assess AS patients with suspected ATTR-CA. Clinical signs, such as disproportionate heart failure symptoms, conduction abnormalities, and low-flow, low-gradient AS, were evaluated. Electrocardiographic findings, including low-voltage QRS complexes and pseudo-infarction patterns, were also assessed. Treatment options, including transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and emerging pharmacotherapies for ATTR-CA, were analyzed. Results: The study found that ATTR-CA is increasingly prevalent in AS patients, with shared mechanisms like oxidative stress and amyloid-induced tissue remodeling. Key diagnostic signs include disproportionate heart failure symptoms, conduction abnormalities, and specific electrocardiographic patterns. TAVR was effective in both isolated AS and AS with ATTR-CA, although patients with both conditions had a higher risk of heart failure hospitalization and persistent symptoms. Emerging pharmacotherapies, such as TTR stabilizers and gene-silencing agents, showed promise in slowing disease progression. Conclusions: A multimodal diagnostic approach is essential for the early detection of ATTR-CA in AS patients. Combining TAVR with emerging pharmacotherapies may improve long-term outcomes for this high-risk group, enhancing patient care in those with both conditions.","['Ioannis Gialamas', 'George E Zakynthinos', 'George Dimeas', 'Panteleimon Pantelidis', 'Elias Gialafos', 'Styliani Brili', 'Athina Goliopoulou', 'Ourania Katsarou', 'Elsi Tryfou', 'Konstantinos Kalogeras', 'Gerasimos Siasos', 'Evangelos Oikonomou']",Journal of clinical medicine,2025-04-12,10.3390/jcm14082652,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm14082652,PMC12027563,Free,A Tale of Two Diseases Decoding Aortic Stenosis and Cardiac Amyloidosis GIALAMAS 2025,pdfs\A Tale of Two Diseases Decoding Aortic Stenosis and Cardiac Amyloidosis GIALAMAS 2025.pdf,"['Aortic Stenosis', 'patients', 'Decoding Aortic Stenosis', 'ATTR-CA', 'Aortic', 'Cardiac Amyloidosis', 'Stenosis', 'TAVR', 'Amyloidosis', 'Cardiac']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['AS', 'ATTR', 'aortic stenosis', 'cardiac amyloidosis', 'cardiomyopathy', 'hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis', 'low-flow', 'low-gradient aortic stenosis', 'transthyretin', 'transthyretin amyloidosis', 'wild-type transthyretin amyloidosis']"
40270122,The Impact of Concomitant Mitral Regurgitation on Echocardiography Parameters After TransCatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Mitral regurgitation (MR) commonly coexists with aortic stenosis (AS) and is a potential risk factor influencing outcomes following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the mean changes in key echocardiographic parameters before and after TAVR and to compare these changes between patients with moderate-to-severe MR (MR ≥ 2) and those with none-to-mild MR (MR < 2).
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted using six electronic databases. We included studies that evaluated patients undergoing TAVR, classified them based on baseline MR grade ≥ 2 (moderate/severe MR) or MR grade < 2 (none/mild MR), and reported the mean difference (MD) in echocardiographic parameters before and after TAVR in both groups. The primary outcomes included changes in ejection fraction (EF), LV end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) index, LV end-systolic volume (LVESV) index, LV end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), LV end-systolic diameter (LVESD), aortic valve area (AVA), and the mean aortic gradient. Pooled MDs were analyzed using a random-effects model.
RESULTS: Thirteen studies with 7163 patients were included, of which 2376 had an MR ≥ 2. The MR < 2 and MR ≥ 2 groups experienced significant improvements in AVA and reductions in mean aortic gradient, LVEDV index, LVESV index, LVEDD, and LVESD. Compared to MR < 2 patients, those with MR ≥ 2 exhibited significantly greater improvements in EF (MD = 2.03; 95% CI: 0.81, 3.24), LVEDV index (MD = -5.55; 95% CI: -7.85, -3.26), LVESV index (MD = -5.43; 95% CI: -7.28, -3.58), LVESD (MD = -2.23; 95% CI: -3.71, -0.26), and mean aortic gradient (MD = 1.43; 95% CI: 0.79, 2.07). However, the changes in LVEDD and AVA were not significantly different between the groups.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that patients with moderate-to-severe baseline MR before TAVR showed greater pronounced improvements in specific echocardiographic parameters related to LV function and geometry, particularly in LVEF, LVEDV index, LVESV index, and LVESD, compared to those with none-to-mild MR. Future studies should focus on stratifying outcomes according to MR etiology and using advanced imaging techniques to delineate better the mechanisms underlying these improvements.","['Bahar Darouei', 'Reza Amani-Beni', 'Mehrdad Rabiee Rad', 'Ghazal Ghasempour Dabaghi', 'Reza Eshraghi', 'Ashkan Bahrami', 'Ehsan Amini-Salehi', 'Seyyed Mohammad Hashemi', 'Sadegh Mazaheri-Tehrani', 'Mohammad Reza Movahed']",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,2025-04-24,10.1002/ccd.31555,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.31555,,Paid,The Impact of Concomitant Mitral Regurgitation on Echocardiography Parameters After TransCatheter Aortic Valve Replacement A Systematic Review and Meta Analysis DAROUEI 2025,Not available,"['Concomitant Mitral Regurgitation', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Impact of Concomitant', 'Systematic Review', 'Concomitant Mitral', 'TransCatheter Aortic Valve', 'Mitral Regurgitation', 'Valve Replacement', 'Aortic Valve', 'Echocardiography Parameters']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['aortic valve stenosis', 'echocardiography', 'meta‐analysis', 'mitral valve insufficiency', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"

This systematic review examined the association between computed tomography (CT)-derived adipose tissue parameters and TAVI outcomes. We searched major databases for studies on visceral (VAT), subcutaneous (SAT), and intramuscular (IMAT) adipose tissue parameters and post-TAVI outcomes. Fourteen studies (9692 patients) were included. Higher SAT area/volume was consistently associated with better survival (5 studies, HR range: 0.83-2.77, p < 0.05). Lower SAT and VAT density also correlated with better survival (5 and 4 studies, respectively, HR range: 1.31-1.46, p < 0.05). VAT area showed mixed results. A VAT:SAT ratio < 1 was associated with better cardiovascular outcomes in one study. Lower IMAT index correlated with shorter hospital stays in a single study. This review reveals complex relationships between adipose tissue parameters and TAVI outcomes. Lower adipose tissue density and higher subcutaneous adiposity were most consistently associated with better outcomes. These findings suggest that detailed analysis of adipose tissue characteristics may enhance risk stratification in TAVI candidates.","['Matej Pekar', 'Piotr Branny', 'Otakar Jiravsky', 'Radim Spacek', 'Jan Alexander Mohr', 'Ivan Ranic', 'Bogna Jiravska Godula', 'Alica Cesnakova Konecna', 'Marek Kantor', 'Jan Hecko', 'Radek Neuwirth', 'Libor Sknouril', 'Jan Novak']",European journal of medical research,2025-04-24,10.1186/s40001-025-02587-3,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40001-025-02587-3,PMC12020199,Free,CT derived adipose tissue characteristics and TAVI all cause mortality and complications a systematic review PEKAR 2025,pdfs\CT derived adipose tissue characteristics and TAVI all cause mortality and complications a systematic review PEKAR 2025.pdf,"['adipose tissue', 'adipose tissue parameters', 'TAVI', 'tissue parameters', 'tissue', 'adipose', 'Czech Republic', 'adipose tissue characteristics', 'TAVI outcomes', 'CT-derived adipose tissue']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Adipose tissue parameters', 'CT-derived body composition', 'Risk stratification', 'Subcutaneous fat', 'TAVI outcomes', 'Visceral fat']"
40269711,Associations between new-onset postoperative atrial fibrillation and changes in left ventricular mass index in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement.,"BACKGROUND: New-onset postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) is common after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). At present, the impact of POAF on cardiac remodeling after TAVR has not been thoroughly studied.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the impact of POAF on cardiac remodeling and its association with clinical outcomes after TAVR.
METHODS: 601 patients undergoing TAVR for severe aortic stenosis were evaluated. Of these, 253 patients were identified to have POAF, which was categorized as normal left ventricular mass index (LVMI) in 54 (21%) and high LVMI in 199 (79%). The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause death, heart failure rehospitalization and disabling stroke. Reverse remodeling was assessed by transthoracic echocardiography.
RESULTS: In POAF patients, the 3-year cumulative incidence of primary composite outcome in the high LVMI subgroup was significantly higher than that in the normal LVMI subgroup (9.3 ± 3.3% vs. 13.5 ± 3.9%; p = 0.02). The incidence of LVMI regression after TAVR was lower in patients with POAF than in those without (65.6 ± 3.0% vs. 82.6 ± 2.7% at 3 years; p = 0.029). Furthermore, the 3-year cumulative incidence of the primary composite outcome and cardiovascular death was highest in the group of POAF without LVMI regression. Baseline LVMI (β = -1.73, p < 0.001) and POAF (β = -1.46, p < 0.001) were independent predictors of change in LVMI at one year.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with POAF had less LVMI regression and impaired cardiac reverse remodeling after TAVR, which increased the incidence of all-cause death and heart failure rehospitalization. Therefore, clinicians should be more proactive in monitoring and treating POAF after TAVR.","['Hua-Jie Zheng', 'Jun Li', 'Ling-Feng Tang', 'Mei Guo', 'Ya-Nan Wei', 'Wei Cheng']",BMC cardiovascular disorders,2025-04-23,10.1186/s12872-025-04763-z,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12872-025-04763-z,PMC12016421,Free,Associations between new onset postoperative atrial fibrillation and changes in left ventricular mass index in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement ZHENG 2025,pdfs\Associations between new onset postoperative atrial fibrillation and changes in left ventricular mass index in patients undergoing transcath.pdf,"['POAF', 'TAVR', 'LVMI', 'patients', 'patients undergoing TAVR', 'high LVMI', 'LVMI regression', 'aortic valve replacement', 'POAF patients', 'POAF group']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Aortic stenosis', 'Cardiac reverse remodeling', 'Postoperative atrial fibrillation', 'Transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"
40269687,Computed tomography-based coronary lumen volume to myocardial mass ratio in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a novel method for risk assessment.,"BACKGROUND: The coronary lumen volume to myocardial mass (V/M) ratio has been suggested as a quantitative metric of potential imbalance between coronary blood supply and myocardial oxygen demand. This study was designed to assess the prognostic value of the V/M ratio for predicting major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
METHODS: This study enrolled patients who received a standard planning computed tomography (CT) scan before TAVR and dichotomized at the median of 33.31 mm³/g of V/M ratio into groups with low V/M ratio and high V/M ratio. The V/M ratio was calculated by coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA). The endpoint was a composite of all-cause mortality, stroke, and hospitalization for heart failure. The cumulative incidence of the MACE was compared using Kaplan-Meyer plots and uni- and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis.
RESULTS: In total, 139 patients were enrolled in this study finally (mean age 71.7 ± 6.7 years, 41.7% female). The mean V/M ratio was considerably lower in patients with MACE than in those without MACE (26.5 ± 4.9mm3/g vs. 34.0 ± 3.8mm3/g, P<0.001). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression showed that the low V/M ratio group (≤ 33.31 mm³/g) had a higher risk of MACE after TAVR (HR: 6.14, 95%CI: 1.37-27.54; P = 0.018).
CONCLUSIONS: The lower V/M ratio could serve as an independent predictor of MACE in patients undergoing TAVR.

40268155,Preprocedural CT angiography and machine learning for mortality prediction after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.,"Prediction of outcomes following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is challenging. Considering that in aortic stenosis outcomes are governed by both valve degeneration and myocardial adverse remodeling, we aimed to evaluate machine-learning leveraging pre-procedural computed tomography (CT) for the prediction of 1-year mortality following TAVR. The analysis included data of consecutive patients who underwent TAVR at a high-volume center between January 2017 and January 2022 and was externally validated on unseen data from 3 international sites. Machine learning by extreme gradient boosting was trained and tested using clinical variables, CT-derived volumetric measurements including myocardial mass, and quantitative fibrocalcific aortic valve characteristics measured using standardized software. The EuroScore II and a separate machine learning risk score based exclusively on baseline clinical characteristics served as comparators. The derivation cohort included 631 consecutive patients (48 % men, 80 ± 8 years old, EuroSCORE II 6.5 [4.6-10.3] %). Machine learning was externally validated on data of 596 patients (48 % men, 81 ± 8 years old, EuroSCORE II 5.4 [4.7-8.1] %). In external validation, the machine learning prognostic risk score had an area under the receiver operator curve of 0.79 (0.74-0.84) which was superior to the EuroSCORE 0.59 (0.53-0.66), and the machine learning risk based on clinical data alone 0.64 (0.59-0.69), p < 0.001 for difference. Machine-learning integrating clinical data and CT-derived imaging characteristics was found to predict 1-year all-cause mortality following TAVR significantly better than clinical variables or clinical risk scores alone; and can help identify patients at higher prognostic risk prior to the procedure.","['Jacek Kwiecinski', 'Kajetan Grodecki', 'Konrad Pieszko', 'Maciej Dabrowski', 'Zbigniew Chmielak', 'Wojciech Wojakowski', 'Julia Niemierko', 'Jadwiga Fijalkowska', 'Dariusz Jagielak', 'Philipp Ruile', 'Simon Schoechlin', 'Hesham Elzomor', 'Piotr Slomka', 'Adam Witkowski', 'Damini Dey']",Progress in cardiovascular diseases,2025-04-21,10.1016/j.pcad.2025.04.007,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pcad.2025.04.007,,Paid,Preprocedural CT angiography and machine learning for mortality prediction after transcatheter aortic valve replacement KWIECINSKI 2025,Not available,"['aortic valve replacement', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'machine learning', 'valve replacement', 'aortic valve', 'Preprocedural CT angiography', 'transcatheter aortic', 'TAVR', 'machine', 'learning']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Aortic stenosis', 'CT angiography', 'Machine learning', 'Risk scores', 'TAVR']"

40266968,Five-Year Mortality of Surgical and Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in the Real-World Scenario: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Propensity Score Matching Studies.,"INTRODUCTION: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) provide evidence of efficacy, while real-world data (RWD) demonstrate effectiveness in real-world practice. We designed a systematic review and meta-analysis of reconstructed time-to-event (RTE) data from propensity score matching studies comparing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) to compare their effectiveness and evaluate the generalizability of TAVI indications.
METHODS: Systematic review of literature between 2007 and 2023 including propensity score matching studies comparing TAVI or SAVR that reported at least one-year Kaplan-Meier curves of endpoints.
RESULTS: Twenty-one studies were included (39538 participants). TAVI shows a higher all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.41; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.34-1.47, P-value < 0.001), with a significant heterogeneity. The analysis of HR trend over time shows that TAVI superiority is limited to the first month with a steep reversal afterwards, when SAVR becomes clearly superior. All-cause mortality is significantly higher in TAVI in low-risk (HR 1.35; 95% CI 1.08-1.69, P-value < 0.001) as well as in intermediate (HR 1.73; 95% CI 1.35-2.22, P-value < 0.001) and high-risk (HR 1.61; 95% CI 1.38-1.88, P-value < 0.001) patients. The HR trend in the subgroups of risk confirms the data from the whole mixed population.
CONCLUSION: In a real-word setting, TAVI is associated with higher incidence of all-cause death and maintains a survival benefit only in the first month after implantation. These results show that TAVI effectiveness may not reflect the efficacy demonstrated by RCTs and pose a threat to their external validity.","['Mateo Marin-Cuartas', 'Bianca Dalbesio', 'Francesco Pollari', 'Matteo Scarpanti', 'Amedeo Anselmi', 'Manuela de la Cuesta', 'Miguel Sousa Uva', 'Jean-Philippe Verhoye', 'Francesco Musumeci', 'Fabio Barili', 'Alessandro Parolari']",Brazilian journal of cardiovascular surgery,2025-04-23,10.21470/1678-9741-2024-0048,https://doi.org/10.21470/1678-9741-2024-0048,PMC12017277,Free,Five Year Mortality of Surgical and Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in the Real World Scenario A Systematic Review and Meta Analysis of Propensity Score Matching Studies MARIN-CUARTAS 2025,pdfs\Five Year Mortality of Surgical and Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in the Real World Scenario A Systematic Review and Meta Analysis .pdf,"['Cardiac Surgery', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'TAVI', 'Aortic Valve', 'Propensity Score Matching', 'studies comparing TAVI', 'Score Matching Studies', 'surgical aortic valve', 'Cardiac Surgery Unit']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Aortic Valve', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Systematic Review', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement']"

40265281,Evaluation of Tissue Annular Motion Displacement in Patients With Severe Aortic Stenosis With Normal Ejection Fraction.,"AIM: The purpose of this study was to investigate the value of the tissue annular motion displacement (TMAD) parameter in assessing left ventricular systolic function in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) and to investigate the risk factors for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) in patients with severe AS with a biplane Simpson's method ejection fraction (LVEF-Simpson) ≥ 50%.
METHODS: We enrolled 81 patients diagnosed with severe AS and 22 controls. Comparative analyses were performed between the groups, and longitudinal follow-up assessments tracked the incidence of MACEs. Survival analysis, utilizing Kaplan-Meier curves, was employed to determine the prognostic significance of TMAD parameters.
RESULTS: TMAD parameters showed negative linear correlations with left ventricle global longitudinal strain (LVGLS). Overall, 69 patients (85.2%) underwent successful transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), which significantly improves myocardial longitudinal systolic function. MACE occurred in 12 (14.8%) AS patients during the follow-up period.
CONCLUSION: TMAD parameters allowed early detection of left ventricle systolic dysfunction (LVSF) in severe AS patients with normal ejection fraction and correlated well with LVGLS, and TMADmid-A4C was a strong predictor of MACE in severe AS patients with preserved LVEF.","['Jie Feng', 'Yao Li', 'Shiyuan Zhang', 'Haixia Wei', 'Hangyu Liu', 'Yanqing Wu']",Journal of clinical ultrasound : JCU,2025-04-23,10.1002/jcu.24032,https://doi.org/10.1002/jcu.24032,,Paid,Evaluation of Tissue Annular Motion Displacement in Patients With Severe Aortic Stenosis With Normal Ejection Fraction FENG 2025,Not available,"['Tissue Annular Motion', 'Annular Motion Displacement', 'Severe Aortic Stenosis', 'Normal Ejection Fraction', 'Annular Motion', 'Tissue Annular', 'Motion Displacement', 'Simpson method ejection', 'Ejection Fraction', 'method ejection fraction']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['LVEF', 'aortic stenosis', 'speckle tracking imaging', 'tissue motion annular displacement', 'transthoracic echocardiography']"
40264567,Transcatheter aortic valve replacement via direct aortic access for severe aortic stenosis with double aortic arch.,"Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is an established treatment for managing severe aortic stenosis. Preoperative planning requires cautious identification of the access route, which can be challenging in patients with anatomical abnormalities of the aorta. Double aortic arch (DAA) is a congenital condition where the aorta bifurcates into two separate vessels that encircle the trachea and esophagus, thereby forming a vascular ring. This condition accounts for ~1% of congenital cardiovascular anomalies. Previous reports on TAVR performed on patients with DAA are limited, and there is no consensus on the appropriate access route. Herein, we present an 85-year-old female patient with DAA and aortic stenosis who underwent a successful TAVR using the direct aortic approach.","['Akihito Arai', 'Mimiko Tabata', 'Kenichiro Takahashi', 'Ryo Izubuchi', 'Minako Hayakawa', 'Joshi Tsutsumi', 'Akihiro Urabe']",Journal of surgical case reports,2025-04-12,10.1093/jscr/rjaf251,https://doi.org/10.1093/jscr/rjaf251,PMC12013706,Free,Transcatheter aortic valve replacement via direct aortic access for severe aortic stenosis with double aortic arch ARAI 2025,pdfs\Transcatheter aortic valve replacement via direct aortic access for severe aortic stenosis with double aortic arch ARAI 2025.pdf,"['aortic', 'Transcatheter aortic valve', 'double aortic arch', 'direct aortic approach', 'aortic valve replacement', 'aortic arch', 'TAVR', 'severe aortic stenosis', 'aortic valve', 'direct aortic']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['direct aortic approach', 'double aortic arch', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"
40263218,Proximal stent migration during coarctation of aorta stenting.,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter stenting has become the preferred treatment for native and recurrent coarctation of aorta (CoA), but complications such as stent migration occur in approximately 5% of cases. Proximal stent migration is particularly challenging and often requires surgical intervention. This report highlights the successful transcatheter management of proximal stent migration during CoA stenting in a high-risk patient.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 22-year-old woman with Turner syndrome and chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP) presented with severe native CoA and refractory hypertension. Echocardiography revealed severe left ventricular hypertrophy and bicuspid aortic valve with mild aortic stenosis. The CoA segment gradient was 90 mmHg. During stent implantation using a 16 × 44 mm Zephyr stent mounted on an Atlas balloon, the stent migrated proximally into the right brachiocephalic artery despite appropriate crimping and hypotensive pacing. The stent was stabilized using a pigtail catheter via the right radial artery, and a low-profile peripheral balloon was inflated distal to the stent to pull the system back. However, the stent became stuck at the tightest segment of the CoA. Predilation of the CoA site with a larger balloon widened the segment, allowing the stent to be repositioned and deployed successfully. Post-procedure, the gradient across the CoA decreased to less than 5 mmHg. The patient was discharged after two days without complications, and follow-up imaging confirmed proper stent placement without restenosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our case illustrates the transcatheter management of proximal stent migration during CoA stenting, potentially reducing the need for surgical intervention. A stepwise strategy involving stent stabilization, low-profile balloon-assisted repositioning, and predilation of tight CoA segments can facilitate successful stent repositioning. This case contributes to the existing literature by documenting the occurrence and management of this rare complication.","['Aamir Rashid', 'Vamiq Rasool', 'Jan Mohammad', 'Imran Hafeez', 'Shahood Ajaz', 'Hilal Rather']",The Egyptian heart journal : (EHJ) : official bulletin of the Egyptian Society of Cardiology,2025-04-22,10.1186/s43044-025-00637-z,https://doi.org/10.1186/s43044-025-00637-z,PMC12014972,Free,Proximal stent migration during coarctation of aorta stenting RASHID 2025,pdfs\Proximal stent migration during coarctation of aorta stenting RASHID 2025.pdf,"['stent', 'Proximal stent migration', 'CoA', 'stent migration', 'Proximal stent', 'CoA segment', 'segment', 'CoA stenting', 'balloon', 'migration']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['CoA stenting', 'Proximal migration', 'Transcatheter']"
40262657,SINGLE PERCLOSE PLUS PLUG BASED DEVICE VERSUS DOUBLE PERCLOSE FOR PERCUTANEOUS LARGE BORE ARTERIAL ACCESS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META ANALYSIS.,"OBJECTIVE: Vascular Closure primarily utilizing Suture Based Devices (SBD) are frequently used for large bore percutaneous arterial access in patients undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVR) and Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (EVAR). Little is known about the intentional combination of SBD with PBD. Main objective was to determine the efficacy of adopting a combined SBD and PBD strategy compared to double SBD for large bore arterial access.
REVIEW METHODS: We searched randomized and observational studies comparing both strategies and that reported the outcomes of major vascular and vascular complications, major bleeding, all bleeding events, need for surgical or endovascular interventions, device failure, additional device and pseudoaneurysm. A meta-analysis was conducted, with heterogeneity assessed using the I2 statistic and a random-effects model applied to all outcomes. Additionally, trial sequential analysis was performed.
RESULTS: We included 3 randomized trials and 4 observational studies with 2,064 access. Sheath size ranged from 13 to 24 Fr. Vascular complications (RR 0.54; p<0.01), major vascular complications (RR 0.55; p=0.04), major bleeding (RR 0.49; p=0.02), need for surgical intervention (RR 0.25; p=0.01), and additional device (RR 0.12; p<0.01) were significantly less common in patients treated with the SBD and PBD technique. Pseudoaneurysm (RR 1.13; p=0.71), all bleeding events (RR 0.59; p=0.1), and endovascular intervention (RR 0.65; p=0.26) were not significantly different between groups.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that one SBD, combined with PBD, was associated with less femoral access complications when compared to the exclusive double SBD as a vascular closure strategy in patients with large bore arterial access.","['Enrico Prajiante Bertolino', 'Milena Monteiro Mastra Fontoura', 'Cynthia Florêncio de Mesquita', 'Dilson da Silva Pimentel', 'Miguel Godeiro Fernandez', 'Ivo Queiroz', 'Braiana Ángeles Díaz Herrera', 'Altino Ono Moraes', 'Ross Millner', 'Grace Carvajal Mulatti']",Annals of vascular surgery,2025-04-20,10.1016/j.avsg.2025.04.107,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.avsg.2025.04.107,,Paid,SINGLE PERCLOSE PLUS PLUG BASED DEVICE VERSUS DOUBLE PERCLOSE FOR PERCUTANEOUS LARGE BORE ARTERIAL ACCESS A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META ANALYSIS BERTOLINO 2025,Not available,"['VERSUS DOUBLE PERCLOSE', 'SINGLE PERCLOSE', 'PLUG BASED DEVICE', 'BASED DEVICE VERSUS', 'LARGE BORE ARTERIAL', 'BORE ARTERIAL ACCESS', 'Aortic Valve Implantation', 'DEVICE VERSUS DOUBLE', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'PERCLOSE PLUS PLUG']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Angioseal', 'Closure device', 'Endovascular aneurysm repair', 'Perclose', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement', 'vascular closure']"
40262017,Perioperative Outcomes in Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement with Concomitant Mitral Regurgitation: A Meta-Analysis.,"Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is widely performed in high-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis. However, the effects of baseline concomitant mitral regurgitation (MR) on perioperative outcomes remain unclear. This study evaluated the impact of concomitant MR severity on short-term TAVR outcomes. A systematic search of 6 electronic databases was conducted. Studies that stratified patients based on MR severity (MR ≥2 vs. <2 or MR ≥3 vs. <3) and reported perioperative outcomes, including short-term mortality, in-hospital mortality, acute kidney injury (AKI), pacemaker implantation, bleeding, vascular complications, and MR improvement (up to 1 week and 1 month) were eligible. Data from 26 studies (32,453 patients) demonstrated that patients with baseline moderate-to-severe MR (MR ≥2) had a 49% (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.32-1.70) increased risk of short-term mortality, a 41% (95% CI, 1.22-1.63) higher risk of in-hospital mortality, and a 38% (95% CI, 1.17-1.62) higher risk of AKI than those with none-to-mild MR (MR<2). Patients with an MR ≥3 had an even greater 72% (95% CI, 1.37-2.16) increase in short-term mortality. No significant differences were observed in pacemaker implantation, bleeding, or vascular complications between groups. Additionally, after TAVR, MR improved in 36% of patients by at least 1 grade within 1 week, increasing to 44% by 1 month. In TAVR patients, MR ≥2 was associated with significantly higher early mortality and AKI risk, underscoring the need for a comprehensive perioperative risk assessment. Future studies should examine the differential impact of functional and degenerative MR.","['Reza Amani-Beni', 'Bahar Darouei', 'Mehrdad Rabiee Rad', 'Ghazal Ghasempour Dabaghi', 'Reza Eshraghi', 'Ashkan Bahrami', 'Ehsan Amini-Salehi', 'Seyyed Mohammad Hashemi', 'Sadegh Mazaheri-Tehrani', 'Mohammad Reza Movahed']",Cardiology in review,2025-04-22,10.1097/CRD.0000000000000919,https://doi.org/10.1097/CRD.0000000000000919,,Paid,Perioperative Outcomes in Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement with Concomitant Mitral Regurgitation A Meta Analysis AMANI-BENI 2025,Not available,"['Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Patients Undergoing Transcatheter', 'Concomitant Mitral Regurgitation', 'Undergoing Transcatheter', 'Aortic Valve', 'Valve Replacement', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'Mitral Regurgitation']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['aortic valve stenosis', 'mitral valve insufficiency', 'mortality', 'perioperative care', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"
40261426,The implementation of a streamlined TAVI patient pathway across five European countries: BENCHMARK registry.,"BACKGROUND: Benchmark best practices have been shown to streamline the clinical pathway for patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), but the impact in diverse health systems is unknown.
AIMS: We evaluated the impact of Benchmark best practices implementation in Germany, Austria, France, Spain, and Italy.
METHODS: International, multicentre registry of severe symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) patients undergoing TAVI with a balloon-expandable valve, before and after Benchmark best practices implementation. Objectives were to reduce overall and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LoS), and to document 30-day safety.
RESULTS: A total of 890 patients were analysed in France, 454 in Spain, 362 in Germany, 300 in Italy, and 176 in Austria. Patients had the highest surgical risk in Germany (EuroSCORE II 6.8 ± 7.3%) and lowest in Spain (3.8 ± 2.6%). Austrian patients reported higher rates of prior myocardial infarction, severe pulmonary hypertension, and aortic valve-related symptoms at baseline. After the implementation of Benchmark best practices, the median hospital LoS was significantly reduced in France (5 vs. 3 days, p < 0.001), Spain (6 vs. 4, p < 0.001), Germany (9 vs. 6, p < 0.001), and Italy (7 vs. 5, p < 0.001); reductions in median ICU LoS were reported in France (1.1 vs. 0 days, p < 0.001), Spain (1.9 vs. 1, p < 0.001), and Germany (1 vs. 0.9, p = 0.004). Across all countries, 30-day safety outcomes were uncompromised and reduced rates of major vascular complications rates were observed in Germany (5.9 vs. 0.0%, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The implementation of Benchmark best practices in diverse European healthcare systems resulted in reduced hospital and ICU LoS without compromising patient safety.

This study investigates sex-related differences in survival and safety outcomes in patients with aortic stenosis undergoing TAVR.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Library until November 2024. Individual patient data (IPD) were reconstructed from published Kaplan-Meier curves and compared using Cox-proportional hazards model for overall survival and cardiovascular mortality. Pooled risk ratios (RR) for safety outcomes at 30-days and one year were estimated using a random-effects model. A total of 48 studies (69,355 women and 65,580 men) were included. Meta-analysis of reconstructed IPD showed that men were at higher risk of all-cause mortality at five years (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.24, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.20-1.28, P<0.001) and cardiovascular mortality at four years (HR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.21-1.49, P<0.001) compared with women. In random-effects meta-analysis, men faced a higher risk of permanent pacemaker implantation (RR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.16-1.44, P<0.001) during the first year. Men experienced a lower risk of stroke (RR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.64-0.87, P<0.001) and major vascular complications (RR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.49-0.69, P<0.001) at 30 days, and a lower risk of major bleeding (RR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.70-0.84, P<0.001) as well as major vascular complications (RR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.43-0.68, P<0.001) within the first year.
CONCLUSION: Men demonstrated poorer five-year overall survival and four-year cardiovascular survival following TAVR compared with women.

40260550,Impact of Calcified Raphe on TAVR in Bicuspid Patients: Predicting Redo-TAVR Feasibility and Virtual Planning Implications.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with bicuspid aortic stenosis who receive transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) may require subsequent valve interventions in their lifetime; however, the feasibility of redo-TAVR in this population is uncertain. We aimed to assess redo-TAVR feasibility in bicuspid patients and develop a predictive virtual valve planning algorithm.
METHODS: We studied computed tomography scans of bicuspid patients who received a balloon-expandable transcatheter heart valve (THV) in the LRT trial (Low Risk TAVR). Redo-TAVR feasibility, determined by valve-to-coronary and valve-to-aorta measurements on 30-day computed tomography, was assessed according to raphe location and calcification. A virtual valve planning algorithm was developed using baseline and 30-day computed tomography scans.
RESULTS: Among 42 patients (left/right cusp fusion: n=34; right/noncusp fusion: n=4; 2-sinus: n=4), redo-TAVR was feasible in 64%, while 36% would likely require leaflet modification to prevent coronary obstruction. Patients with left/right fusion and calcified raphe had higher redo-TAVR feasibility (88% versus 35%, P<0.001) due to favorable shifting of the THV away from the coronary ostia. A bicuspid virtual planning algorithm accounting for 83.4% THV underexpansion, resulting in an 11.9% taller frame and translation of the THV away from the calcified raphe (mean valve shift 6.6 mm) achieved 86.7% sensitivity and 88.9% specificity for predicting redo-TAVR feasibility.
CONCLUSIONS: Calcified raphe in left/right cusp fusion shifts the THV away from the coronary ostia, reducing coronary obstruction risk during redo-TAVR. Underexpansion causing increased THV frame height and valve shifting is common in bicuspid patients; a virtual planning algorithm accounting for these aspects can accurately assess redo-TAVR risk.

AIMS: We aimed to assess different strategies of PCI timing in this high-risk TAVI cohort.
METHODS: The ASCoP registry retrospectively included patients with a clinical indication for both TAVI and PCI with at least 1 criterion of complex or high-risk PCI. The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause death and unplanned rehospitalisation for cardiovascular causes. The secondary endpoint was a composite of all-cause death, stroke, acute myocardial infarction, major bleeding, major vascular complication and unplanned revascularisation. Multivariable analysis was used to adjust for possible confounders.
RESULTS: A total of 519 patients were included: 363 (69.9%) underwent staged procedures and 156 (30.1%) concomitant TAVI and PCI. After 441 (interquartile range 182-824) days, the primary endpoint occurred in 151 (36.5%) cases, without any significant difference between the 2 groups (p=0.98), while the secondary endpoint occurred more frequently in the concomitant group (n=36 [25.8%] vs n=57 [17.4%]; p=0.014).

40259836,Prognostic value of invasive versus echocardiography-derived aortic gradient in patients undergoing TAVI.,"BACKGROUND: Recent studies report a discordance between invasive and echocardiography-derived gradients after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) with balloon-expandable (BEV) and self-expanding valves (SEV). There are limited data on the determinants and clinical implications of this discordance.
AIMS: We aimed to examine the prognostic value of invasive and echocardiography-derived gradients after implantation of SEV and BEV and to compare gradients for SEV versus BEV.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective, propensity score-matched study. Invasive measurements were obtained before and immediately after TAVI. Echocardiography was performed before and within 24 hours after TAVI, and at 1 year. Clinical outcomes were assessed at 30 days, 1 year, and 2 years.
RESULTS: The 1:1 propensity score matching resulted in 436 matched pairs (436 SAPIEN 3 and 436 Evolut). Invasive gradients post-TAVI independently predicted higher risk for all-cause mortality at 30 days, 1 year and 2 years as a continuous variable (hazard ratio [HR] 1.07, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.00-1.14; p=0.038; HR 1.06, 95% CI: 1.01-1.11; p=0.007; HR 1.05, 95% CI: 1.01-1.09; p=0.011, respectively) and by using >10 mmHg as a cutoff (HR 1.95, 95% CI: 1.13-4.78; p=0.028; HR 1.91, 95% CI: 1.11-3.65; p=0.030; HR 1.61, 95% CI: 1.03-2.96; p=0.021, respectively), but echocardiography-derived gradients did not (HR 1.13, 95% CI: 0.87-1.75; p=0.247; HR 1.02, 95% CI: 0.95-1.10; p=0.639; HR 0.99, 95% CI: 0.94-1.07; p=0.979, respectively). Mean gradients before and after TAVI were higher by echocardiography than by invasive measurements. The difference was more pronounced after implantation with BEV than SEV (7.0 [25th-75th percentile: 4.0-11.0] mmHg vs 5.0 [2.0-7.0] mmHg; p<0.001). Smaller valve size, higher ejection fraction and higher stroke volume amplified the discordance. Invasive mean gradients were similar after SEV and BEV (3.0 [0.0-6.0] mmHg vs 3.0 [0.0-6.0] mmHg; p=0.166), but echo-derived mean gradients were lower after SEV versus BEV (8.0 [6.0-11.0] mmHg vs 11.0 [8.0-14.0] mmHg; p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Only invasively measured but not echocardiography-derived transvalvular mean gradients correlate with 30-day, 1-year and 2-year mortality. Aortic gradient measurements are higher by echocardiography than by invasive assessment and more so for BEV than SEV. Smaller valve size, higher ejection fraction and higher stroke volume increase this discordance between echocardiography and invasive assessment.","['Mark M P van den Dorpel', 'Sraman Chatterjee', 'Rik Adrichem', 'Sarah Verhemel', 'Isabella Kardys', 'Rutger-Jan Nuis', 'Joost Daemen', 'Claire Ben Ren', 'Alexander Hirsch', 'Marcel L Geleijnse', 'Nicolas M Van Mieghem']",EuroIntervention : journal of EuroPCR in collaboration with the Working Group on Interventional Cardiology of the European Society of Cardiology,2025-04-21,10.4244/EIJ-D-24-00341,https://doi.org/10.4244/EIJ-D-24-00341,PMC11995293,Paid,Prognostic value of invasive versus echocardiography derived aortic gradient in patients undergoing TAVI DORPEL 2025,Not downloaded,"['patients undergoing TAVI', 'SEV versus BEV', 'SEV', 'BEV', 'gradients', 'invasive', 'TAVI', 'mmHg', 'undergoing TAVI', 'echocardiography-derived gradients']",2025-05-12,Pending,[]
40258459,Association of Body Mass Index With Procedural Success and Outcomes in Patients undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.,"Obesity is a major public health concern linked to adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Recent studies suggest an obesity paradox, showing lower mortality in obese patients after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). This study investigates the impact of body mass index (BMI) on procedural and long-term clinical outcomes in patients undergoing TAVI. Patients undergoing TAVI at two high-volume centers were analyzed and categorized into four BMI groups: underweight (BMI <18.5 kg/m2), normal (BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/m2), overweight (BMI 25.0-29.9 kg/m2), and obese (BMI ≥30.0 kg/m2). To relax the proportional hazards assumption, restricted cubic splines were constructed. The primary outcome was procedural success and safety, including 30-day all-cause-mortality, stroke, and overall bleeding. Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality at one and five years. In total, 6,156 patients were included: 114 (1.8%) were underweight, 2,393 (38.8%) normal weight, 2,380 (38.6%) overweight, and 1,269 (20.6%) obese. No significant differences between BMI groups were found in 30-day mortality, stroke, or bleeding. However, underweight patients had higher mortality compared to normal-weight patients at one year (23.7 vs 13.2%, p = 0.001) and five years (53.2% vs. 44.0%, p = 0.048). Obese patients had similar mortality to normal-weight patients at one year (11.4 vs 13.2%, p = 0.120) and five years (41.0 vs 44.0%, p = 0.200). Obesity showed no outcome advantage over normal weight, while underweight was an independent predictor of higher all-cause mortality after TAVI. These findings challenge the obesity paradox in the context of TAVI.","['Jakob J Reichl', 'Adisa Poljo', 'Thorald Stolte', 'Ramona Schmitt', 'Jasper Boeddinghaus', 'Max Wagener', 'Gregor Leibundgut', 'Christoph Kaiser', 'Dirk Westermann', 'Tau Hartikainen', 'Felix Mahfoud', 'Philipp Ruile', 'Philipp Breitbart', 'Thomas Nestelberger']",The American journal of cardiology,2025-04-19,10.1016/j.amjcard.2025.04.012,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjcard.2025.04.012,,Paid,Association of Body Mass Index With Procedural Success and Outcomes in Patients undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation REICHL 2025,Not available,"['Aortic Valve Implantation', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Body Mass Index', 'Valve Implantation', 'Aortic Valve', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'undergoing Transcatheter Aortic', 'BMI', 'patients undergoing TAVI', 'Body Mass']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Aortic stenosis', 'Body Mass Index', 'Obesity', 'Obesity paradox', 'Transcatheter aortic valve implantation', 'Underweight']"
40258409,The randomized controlled trial to compare temporary permanent pacemaker vs temporary pacemaker in patients with conduction block after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: Rationale and design of the RECOVER trial.,"RATIONALE: Current guidelines and expert consensus recommend different time thresholds of temporary pacemaker (TM) indwelling in patients with conduction block after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Accordingly, this lack of clinical evidence and effective strategies has resulted in extensive variations in permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation patterns, potentially leading to over-early PPM implantation. The use of a temporary permanent pacemaker (TPPM), which involves an active fixation pacing lead and an external pulse generator secured to the skin surface, may be effective and safe in these patients. TPPM may improve postoperative mobility and facilitate early discharge, while providing prolonged and stable pacing for the recovery of conduction block, thereby reducing unnecessary PPM implantation.
DESIGN: The RECOVER trial is a prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled study comparing TPPM vs TM in patients with conduction block after TAVR. The trial will enroll 160 subjects across 13 sites in China. Inclusion criteria include patients with persistent third-degree atrioventricular block (AVB), second-degree AVB, first-degree AVB with symptoms (PR interval >300 ms), alternating bundle branch block or bifascicular block with syncope/blackness related symptoms occurred during TAVR procedure or within 1 month after TAVR. Enrolled patients will be randomized 1:1 to the TPPM group for a 1-month bridge or the TM group for conventional 24 to 48 hours pacing. The primary effectiveness endpoint is the rate of PPM implantation at 6 months after the occurrence of AVB. Secondary effectiveness endpoint is the rate of PPM implantation at 1 month after the occurrence of AVB. Safety endpoints include all-cause mortality and TPPM/TM/PPM procedure-related complications during the 6-month follow-up. Key data collected will include sociodemographic information, medical history, electrocardiograph, HOLTER, echocardiography, contrast-enhanced cardiac CT, details of procedures and pacemaker interrogation. Indication for PPM implantation will be adjudicated by an independent pacing electrophysiologist committee.
CONCLUSION: The RECOVER trial will evaluate whether TPPM is superior to conventional TM in reducing the rate of PPM implantation in patients with conduction block after TAVR, with a buffer period to distinguish whether conduction block is reversible or persistent.
CURRENT STATUS: The trial is still enrolling participants (with 14 enrolled as of January 1, 2025).

40257711,High-flow oxygenation therapy for a sedated elderly frail patient with hiccups undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation.,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) can be performed under sedation, but body movements may lower the efficacy of the procedure and may increase the risk of complications, such as cardiac tamponade. Additional sedatives and analgesics may be required to prevent body movements; this would increase the risk of upper airway obstruction and of respiratory depression. We report a frail patient with hypoxemia and hiccups, in whom high-flow nasal oxygenation facilitated TAVI by effectively inhibiting body movements and respiratory complications.
CASE PRESENTATION: In an 82-year-old patient with severe aortic stenosis, heart failure, hypoxemia, and hiccups, TAVI was planned under sedation with dexmedetomidine, fentanyl, and ketamine. High-flow nasal oxygenation effectively prevented hiccups and associated body movements, and prevented upper airway obstruction and respiratory depression, during TAVI.

40254143,Management of TAVR in asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients: Insights from resting angiographic microvascular resistance.,"BACKGROUND: The optimal timing of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) remains controversial. Microvascular dysfunction and increased microcirculatory resistance have been linked to adverse outcomes in AS, suggesting that resting angiographic microvascular resistance (AMRr) may aid in identifying higher-risk patients.
METHOD: We conducted a retrospective study of 180 severe AS patients who underwent TAVR at Fuwai Hospital between 2012 and 2021. Patients were grouped based on an AMRr cutoff value of 490, identified through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The primary endpoint was the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), including all-cause mortality, heart failure, and myocardial infarction. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were used to compare outcomes between groups.
RESULTS: A total of 180 asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic AS patients undergoing TAVR were enrolled. After a 40-month follow-up, the AMRr >490 group had a higher MACE risk, mainly driven by readmission for heart failure. Additionally, continuous analysis indicated that every 100-unit increase in AMRr was associated with an 18 %, 17 %, and 1.58-fold increased risk of MACE, all-cause mortality, and NOAF, respectively. Moreover, the addition of AMRr to a clinical model significantly improved the prediction of MACE (AUC 0.678 vs. 0.582, p = 0.023).
CONCLUSION: Asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic AS patients with AMRr >490 had a significantly higher incidence of MACE and heart failure rehospitalization than those with AMRr ≤490 after TAVR.

CASE SUMMARY: This article presents the case of a 74-year-old man who presented with dyspnea and was diagnosed with severe aortic regurgitation. TAVR with a self-expanding valve was performed but complicated with valve migration toward the left ventricle, resulting in severe paravalvular regurgitation. Ultimately, the valve dragging technique was used to reposition the initial valve and a second valve was implanted, achieving satisfactory final outcomes.
DISCUSSION: This technique provides a novel strategy for valve migration after TAVR, avoiding surgical reintervention.

40252068,Unusual Case of Acute Type A Aortic Dissection During TAVR Bailout With a Self-Expanding Valve.,"BACKGROUND: Over the past 2 decades, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has emerged as a widely accepted treatment for patients with severe aortic valve stenosis. Acute aortic dissection, although rare, is a life-threatening complication associated with TAVR.
CASE SUMMARY: An older man with severe aortic stenosis underwent TAVR. During valve deployment, catheter manipulation caused intimal disruption, leading to acute type A aortic dissection (TAAD). Remarkably, the dissection spontaneously sealed after prosthetic valve placement, thereby avoiding emergency surgery. A 6-month follow-up computed tomography angiography scan showed no extension of the dissection.
DISCUSSION: In the case we report, the dissection spontaneously sealed with the use of a prosthetic valve, a finding that reinforces the feasibility of nonsurgical management of iatrogenic TAAD during TAVR in select cases.

It involved initiation of extracorporeal circulatory support, followed by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and, subsequently, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) using a TaurusElite valve (Peijia Medical). This strategy resulted in marked hemodynamic improvement.
DISCUSSION: This case highlights the efficacy and safety of concurrent PCI and TAVR as a lifesaving strategy for cardiogenic shock patients with concomitant severe CAD and AS.

Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is also recommended for penetrating aortic ulcer. Especially in older patients with severe AS and penetrating aortic ulcer at the same time, the surgical method brings significant risk.
CASE SUMMARY: We report a case of a 74-year-old male patient who presented with a 10-day history of dyspnea. He was diagnosed with severe AS with aortic valve insufficiency (penetrating aortic ulcer) and had multiple comorbidities. The patient underwent a 1-stop TEVAR + TAVR procedure.
DISCUSSION: The challenge was compounded by the patient's extremely narrow femoral access. This case demonstrates the 2 operations can be performed as a procedure.

40252062,Extreme Anchoring: Self-Expanding Valve TAVR for Severe Pure Aortic Regurgitation in Sinus of Valsalva Aneurysm.,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for pure aortic regurgitation (PAR) remains technically challenging because of the lack of calcified annular structures for device anchoring.
CASE SUMMARY: We report successful noncoronary sinus pivot implantation (NCPI) of a 29-mm self-expanding valve in a high-risk PAR patient (Society of Thoracic Surgeons 8.2%) with extreme root dilatation and no calcification under the STABLE protocol. Post-procedure imaging confirmed hemodynamic success, no paravalvular leak, ventricular recovery, and optimal root remodeling.
DISCUSSION: This case highlights the role of annular-subannular anchoring (NCPI technique) and multimodality imaging in TAVR PAR with sinus of Valsalva aneurysm, addressing migration risks and expanding procedural feasibility beyond calcific stenosis-a critical advancement in an understudied population.

KEY STEPS: Our key steps included the following: 1) unsuccessful withdrawal of the buckled delivery system and valve into the inline sheath; 2) transradial snaring of the delivery system, followed by traction from both ends to reduce the amount of buckling; and 3) once elongated as much as possible, the malfunctioning Evolut delivery system and valve were removed as a unit over the wire.
POTENTIAL PITFALLS: Aortic, iliac, or femoral injury: Reliant balloon was placed in the distal aorta use in case of arterial rupture.
TAKE-HOME MESSAGES: The Evolut delivery system can buckle and accordion under tension in complex aortic anatomy. A technique of snaring from above and tension from below can mitigate the buckled area and allow removal of the damaged delivery system via the endovascular route.","['Ahmed Ghoneem', 'Mubashir Mumtaz', 'Paul D Mahoney']",JACC.

40248303,Aortic and mitral structural interventions in the absence of cardiac surgery.,"Traditionally, structural heart interventions have been performed at heart valve centres with on-site heart surgery to maximize expertise and deal with complications requiring emergent cardiac surgery (ECS). However, at present, only transcatheter aortic-valve implantation (TAVI) must be performed at centres with on-site heart surgery according to current guidelines, while mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair, or left appendage atrial occlusion could be performed also in centres without on-site cardiac surgery. Today, ageing of the population and improved results of TAVI have increased the need for such procedures posing strong pressure to traditional heart valve centres, prolonging waiting times for TAVI and increasing access disparities. Fortunately, TAVI procedures have a very low rate of complications, including those necessitating ECS, and observational data suggest that TAVI can be safely performed in centres without on-site cardiac surgery. However, guideline recommendations need randomized clinical trials like the TRanscatheter Aortic-Valve Implantation with or without on-site Cardiac Surgery (TRACS) trial to be updated. The TRACS trial randomizes high-risk symptomatic aortic stenosis patients to treatment by the same operators either at centres with or without on-site cardiac surgery and compares 1-year follow-up. Key issues for structural interventions, in particular TAVI, at centres without on-site surgery are shared indications through heart team evaluation, consistent experiences and competences of non-surgical centres, and strong networking with the Hub centre. The increasing demand for structural heart interventions highlights the need for innovative care models and the careful introduction of a 'Hub-and-Spoke' approach for high-volume heart valve networks could be a study option.","['Gianmarco Iannopollo', 'Alessandro Capecchi', 'Roberto Verardi', 'Luigi Biasco', 'Chiara Pedone', 'Valerio Lanzilotti', 'Matteo Bruno', 'Giampiero Nobile', 'Gianni Casella']",European heart journal supplements : journal of the European Society of Cardiology,2025-03-12,10.1093/eurheartjsupp/suaf038,https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartjsupp/suaf038,PMC12001765,Free,Aortic and mitral structural interventions in the absence of cardiac surgery IANNOPOLLO 2025,pdfs\Aortic and mitral structural interventions in the absence of cardiac surgery IANNOPOLLO 2025.pdf,"['on-site cardiac surgery', 'on-site heart surgery', 'cardiac surgery', 'TAVI', 'on-site cardiac', 'heart valve centres', 'surgery', 'structural heart interventions', 'heart', 'heart surgery']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Heart surgery', 'TAVI', 'TEER']"
40248298,Ten years of transcatheter aortic valve implantation in the NOTION study: the good and the bad.,"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has transformed the treatment of severe aortic stenosis, becoming a preferred option for patients at high and moderate surgical risk and for individuals over 75 years of age. The NOTION study represents the first randomized clinical trial to reach a 10-year follow-up in patients at low surgical risk, comparing TAVI with surgical valve replacement (SAVR). The results show comparable clinical outcomes between TAVI and SAVR in terms of all-cause mortality, stroke, and myocardial infarction. TAVI demonstrated a better haemodynamic profile and a lower incidence of structural valve deterioration (SVD), but showed higher rates of pacemaker requirement and paravalvular leakage compared with surgical replacement. The trial highlights the excellent durability of transcatheter bioprostheses, although new-generation devices and advanced techniques could further reduce adverse events. The study confirms the increasing role of TAVI even in younger patients, but further long-term data will be needed to evaluate its full potential.","['Luigi Ferrarotto', 'Sebastiano Immè', 'Claudia Tamburino', 'Corrado Tamburino']",European heart journal supplements : journal of the European Society of Cardiology,2025-03-12,10.1093/eurheartjsupp/suaf039,https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartjsupp/suaf039,PMC12001784,Free,Ten years of transcatheter aortic valve implantation in the NOTION study the good and the bad FERRAROTTO 2025,pdfs\Ten years of transcatheter aortic valve implantation in the NOTION study the good and the bad FERRAROTTO 2025.pdf,"['TAVI', 'SAVR', 'TAVI group', 'patients', 'SAVR group', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'aortic valve', 'aortic valve implantation', 'valve', 'surgical valve replacement']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Commissural alignment', 'NOTION study', 'Severe aortic stenosis', 'TAVI (transcatheter aortic valve implantation)', 'Valvular structural deterioration (SVD)']"
40248296,Even aortic insufficiency can be treated percutaneously: right?,"Moderate or severe aortic insufficiency (AI) is a relatively rare condition but with significant clinical implications, especially in elderly patients at high surgical risk. Although surgical aortic valve replacement remains the gold standard for treatment, a significant proportion of patients are not eligible due to the high surgical risk. In recent years, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has revolutionized the treatment of aortic stenosis, but its application to AI has encountered significant challenges, mainly related to specific anatomical characteristics of this population. This review provides an overview of the evolution of the transcatheter treatment of AI, highlighting the critical issues of first-generation TAVI devices and the improvements achieved with new-generation and dedicated devices, such as JenaValve and J-Valve. Preliminary data demonstrate encouraging procedural results, including a reduction in residual insufficiency and improved safety in patients at high surgical risk. However, limitations remain, including the high incidence of pacemaker implantation and the lack of long-term randomized clinical trials. In light of technological advances, TAVI represents a promising therapeutic option for selected patients with AI, if performed in high-volume centres with extensive experience in the treatment of aortic disease.","['Nicolò Azzola Guicciardi', 'Alessandro Beneduce', 'Francesco Maisano']",European heart journal supplements : journal of the European Society of Cardiology,2025-03-12,10.1093/eurheartjsupp/suaf026,https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartjsupp/suaf026,PMC12001779,Free,Even aortic insufficiency can be treated percutaneously right?

40248294,Discordance between aortic valve gradient and area: do I trust the significant gradient?,"Aortic stenosis is an increasingly relevant pathology not only for its high prevalence in the population (especially elderly), but also because in recent decades traditional surgery has been accompanied by transcatheter aortic valve implantation, a technique that has allowed a significant increase in effective therapeutic procedures, even in patients previously considered at high surgical risk. It has become essential to make precise diagnoses, based mainly on echo-Doppler that allows to identify the aetiology and severity of the valvular disease. A stenosis is considered severe when the area is <1 cm2, the mean gradient exceeds 40 mmHg and the peak velocity is >4 m/s. Although in many cases these cut-offs are decisive, in others a discrepancy between area (<1 cm2) and gradient (<40 mmHg) is observed, requiring the inclusion of other variables such as ejection fraction (EF > or <50%) and the systolic volume index (normal SVi >35 mL/m2 or reduced <35 mL/m2) to define the severity of the stenosis. This article describes the reasons for this discrepancy, identifies echo-Doppler parameters that further improve the classification of stenosis severity, and defines the indications for second-level examinations such as computed tomography and transoesophageal echocardiography.","['Manuela Muratori', 'Ali Sarah Ghulam', 'Paola Gripari', 'Laura Fusini', 'Francesco Cannata', 'Gianluca Pontone', 'Mauro Pepi']",European heart journal supplements : journal of the European Society of Cardiology,2025-03-12,10.1093/eurheartjsupp/suaf027,https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartjsupp/suaf027,PMC12001774,Free,Discordance between aortic valve gradient and area do I trust the significant gradient?

40240943,Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction Phenotype Is Associated With Early Symptom Onset in Aortic Stenosis and Residual Symptoms After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.,"BACKGROUND: Aortic stenosis can lead to cardiac adaptations and symptoms similar to heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. We hypothesized that a heart failure with preserved ejection fraction phenotype in aortic stenosis is associated with earlier onset of symptoms and reduced symptomatic response after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).
METHODS AND RESULTS: This retrospective cohort study included 469 patients with moderate aortic stenosis. We determined heavy, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary, elder, filling pressure (H2FPEF) score at diagnosis and compared aortic peak jet velocity at onset of dyspnea in patients with low (<6) and high (≥6) H2FPEF score. In a separate cohort of 601 patients undergoing TAVI, we compared New York Heart Association class, NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide), and cardiovascular mortality post-TAVI between patients with low and high H2FPEF scores. In patients with aortic stenosis and a high H2FPEF score (n=43, 9.2%), the median peak jet velocity at onset of dyspnea was 4.2 versus 4.4 m/s in patients with a low H2FPEF score (P<0.001). After TAVI, a high H2FPEF score (n=123, 20%) was associated with a lower proportion of New York Heart Association class I at 30 days (49% versus 61%; P=0.04), persistently elevated NT-proBNP, and higher 5-year rate of cardiovascular mortality (36% versus 30%; P=0.012), compared with a low H2FPEF score.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with aortic stenosis with a heart failure with preserved ejection fraction phenotype are more likely to develop symptoms at lower gradients and have worse outcomes post-TAVI. Randomized trials are warranted to investigate whether medical therapy targeted at heart failure with preserved ejection fraction delays onset of symptoms and improves symptomatic response after TAVI.","['Constantijn S Venema', 'Kees H van Bergeijk', 'Jan A Krikken', 'Hindrik W van der Werf', 'Ad F M van den Heuvel', 'Yvonne L Douglas', 'Ify R Mordi', 'Nicolas Girerd', 'Chim C Lang', 'Carolyn S P Lam', 'Martin B Leon', 'Erik Lipsic', 'Michiel Rienstra', 'Adriaan A Voors', 'Joanna J Wykrzykowska']",Journal of the American Heart Association,2025-05-06,10.1161/JAHA.124.038786,https://doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.124.038786,,Paid,Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction Phenotype Is Associated With Early Symptom Onset in Aortic Stenosis and Residual Symptoms After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation VENEMA 2025,Not available,"['Preserved Ejection Fraction', 'Ejection Fraction Phenotype', 'Aortic Valve Implantation', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Early Symptom Onset', 'Failure With Preserved', 'Preserved Ejection', 'Ejection Fraction', 'Aortic Stenosis', 'Heart Failure']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['H2FPEF score', 'aortic stenosis', 'aortic valve intervention', 'heart failure', 'structural heart disease']"
40240155,Factors Contributing to Hospital-Associated Disability in Elderly Patients After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.,"BACKGROUND: Hospital-associated disability (HAD), characterized by a worsening of activities of daily living and physical function following hospitalization, is a common complication in older adults during the course of acute care hospitalization. HAD is a significant concern affecting older adults undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).
METHODS AND RESULTS: This retrospective study investigated 243 consecutive patients who underwent elective transfemoral TAVI between January 2016 and April 2022. HAD was defined as a decrease of at least 1 point in the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) assessed before discharge compared with before TAVI. Logistic regression identified the first ambulation day after TAVI as an independent predictor of HAD incidence (odds ratio 1.500; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.115-2.008; P=0.007). Patients with HAD had significantly lower body mass index, hemoglobin, and albumin, and higher serum creatinine. All-cause mortality was significantly higher in patients with than without HAD (log-rank P<0.001). Kaplan-Meier analysis confirmed poorer survival in patients with HAD, regardless of the degree of decline in SPPB. Multivariate Cox analysis regression identified HAD as a predictor of all-cause death (hazard ratio 4.249; 95% CI 1.798-10.04; P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The timing of the first ambulation was associated with the incidence of HAD. Promoting early mobilization may reduce the risk of HAD after TAVI.","['Masashi Shimizu', 'Atsushi Shibata', 'Kodai Taniguchi', 'Tomohiro Yamaguchi', 'Mitsuhiko Ikebuchi', 'Takanori Yamazaki', 'Yosuke Takahashi', 'Terai Hidetomi', 'Toshihiko Shibata', 'Daiju Fukuda']",Circulation journal : official journal of the Japanese Circulation Society,2025-04-17,10.1253/circj.CJ-24-0710,https://doi.org/10.1253/circj.CJ-24-0710,,Paid,Factors Contributing to Hospital Associated Disability in Elderly Patients After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation SHIMIZU 2025,Not available,"['Aortic Valve Implantation', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Factors Contributing', 'Hospital-Associated Disability', 'Valve Implantation', 'Aortic Valve', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'Elderly Patients', 'Contributing to Hospital-Associated', 'Disability in Elderly']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Early mobilization', 'Hospital-associated disability', 'Transcatheter aortic valve implantation']"
40240085,Surgical Mitral Valve Repair vs Replacement After Failed Mitral Transcatheter Edge-to-Edge Repair: The CUTTING-EDGE Registry.,"BACKGROUND: The impact of mitral valve (MV) surgery type after failed mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (M-TEER) has not been well studied.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of MV repair vs replacement after failed M-TEER.
METHODS: From 2009 to 2020, a total of 332 patients across 34 centers from the CUTTING-EDGE registry underwent MV surgery after M-TEER. Outcomes were compared between MV repair and replacement. Primary outcomes included 30-day mortality and 1-year survival after MV surgery.
RESULTS: Among enrolled patients (mean age 73.8 ± 10.1 years, median Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality 3.9% [Q1-Q3: 2.2%-6.8%]), 25 (7.5%) underwent repair and 307 (92.5%) underwent replacement. The replacement group had a significantly higher rate of comorbidities, including atrial fibrillation, prior cardiac surgery, more secondary mitral regurgitation, and more devices implanted at index M-TEER (P < 0.05 for all). Replacement patients showed a trend toward higher 30-day mortality (17.7% [52 of 294] vs 4.0% [1 of 25]; P = 0.094). The observed-to-expected ratio of 30-day mortality was 3.6 (95% CI: 1.9-5.3) overall, 3.8 (95% CI: 2.1-5.5) in the replacement group, and 1.7 (95% CI: 0.7-3.3) in the repair group. Replacement patients had higher 1-year mortality (33.3% [65 of 195] vs 10.5% [2 of 19]; P = 0.041). Significantly lower survival rates were observed after replacement at 2 years (P = 0.033) and persisted in the risk-adjusted Cox regression analysis (HR for replacement: 4.24; 95% CI: 1.04-17.31; P = 0.044).
CONCLUSIONS: MV surgery after failed M-TEER is a high-risk procedure associated with higher than expected 30-day mortality, with higher mortality associated with MV replacement. Compared with repair, replacement is associated with higher 1-year mortality and a lower 2-year survival.","['Mateo Marin-Cuartas', 'Jagdip Kang', 'Thilo Noack', 'Manuela de la Cuesta', 'Markus Krane', 'Volkmar Falk', 'Lenard Conradi', 'Christian Hagl', 'Maurizio Taramasso', 'Tom C Nguyen', 'D Scott Lim', 'Gorav Ailawadi', 'Michael J Mack', 'Robert L Smith', 'Anita W Asgar', 'Kendra J Grubb', 'Luigi Pirelli', 'Paolo Denti', 'Thomas Modine', 'Michael J Reardon', 'Tamim M Nazif', 'Vinayak N Bapat', 'Tsuyoshi Kaneko', 'Philipp Kiefer', 'Michael A Borger', 'Gilbert H L Tang', 'Syed Zaid']",JACC.

40239910,Risk of delayed atrioventricular block in patients without procedural conduction disturbances during transcatheter aortic valve replacement.,"BACKGROUND: Among patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), the risk of delayed atrioventricular block (AVB) in those without procedural conduction disturbances (CDs) remains largely unknown. This may affect hospital stay, particularly same- or next-day discharge after the procedure.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the timing, type, and factors associated with delayed (up to 30 days) AVB in patients without procedural CDs.
METHODS: This was a subanalysis of the PROMOTE trial, a prospective multicenter study including consecutive patients without a prior pacemaker undergoing TAVR and with a prespecified strategy for managing CDs. Patients with no prior right bundle branch block and no procedural CDs were included in this study. Data on 30-day occurrence, timing of AVB, and timing of permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI) were collected in a dedicated database and analyzed overall and according to the preprocedural electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities (either first-degree AVB or abnormal QRS).
RESULTS: A total of 675 patients were included, 334 of whom (49.5%) exhibited baseline ECG abnormalities. At 30 days, 23 patients (3.4%) had delayed AVB (0.6% vs 6.3% in patients with normal and abnormal ECGs preprocedurally, respectively; P < .001). Most (74%) delayed AVB occurred on day 1 or 2 after the procedure. In the multivariable analysis, the factors associated with an increased rate of delayed AVB were preexisting abnormal ECG (odds ratio 5.28; 95% confidence interval 1.53-18.27; P = .009) and left ventricular ejection fraction < 50% (odds ratio 4.17; 95% confidence interval 1.75-9.93; P = .001). Among patients in sinus rhythm with a preprocedural abnormal ECG, those with QRS duration > 120 ms and first-degree AVB exhibited the highest risk (PPI rate 17.8%) followed by those with isolated QRS duration > 120 ms (PPI rate 8.7%).
CONCLUSION: Among TAVR recipients with no procedural CDs, those with an abnormal ECG preprocedurally represent a high-risk group for delayed AVB requiring PPI. This would support a tailored strategy, with a minimalist approach (same- or next-day discharge) in low-risk patients and more prolonged hospitalization or continuous ECG ambulatory monitoring in those at higher risk.

40230300,Impact of Elevated Preprocedural Left Ventricular Filling Pressure on Prognosis of Mild Paravalvular Regurgitation Following Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.,"BACKGROUND: Paravalvular regurgitation (PVR) following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a complication linked to poor outcomes. The prognostic impact of mild PVR, particularly in patients with elevated preprocedural left ventricular (LV) filling pressure, remains uncertain.
AIMS: This study aimed to assess the influence of elevated preprocedural LV filling pressure on mild PVR prognosis following TAVR.
METHODS: This single-center, retrospective study analyzed consecutive patients with severe aortic stenosis who underwent TAVR, excluding those with moderate or severe PVR. Preprocedural LV filling pressure was evaluated using baseline E/A ratio, and patients were stratified into four groups based on E/A ratio (≤1 or >1) and PVR severity (none/trace or mild). The primary endpoint was cardiovascular death within 5 years.
RESULTS: Among 904 patients, 466 had E/A ≤ 1 with none/trace PVR, 92 had E/A > 1 with none/trace PVR, 300 had E/A ≤ 1 with mild PVR, and 46 had E/A > 1 with mild PVR. Multivariable analysis identified E/A > 1 with mild PVR as an independent predictor of cardiovascular death (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 2.38; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.28-4.42; p < 0.01). In contrast, E/A > 1 with none/trace PVR (HR: 1.16, 95% CI: 0.66-2.03) and E/A ≤ 1 with mild PVR (HR: 1.33, 95% CI: 0.89-2.00) were not significant predictors compared to E/A ≤ 1 with none/trace PVR.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated preprocedural LV filling pressure is independently associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular death in patients with mild PVR following TAVR.","['Shumpei Kosugi', 'Isamu Mizote', 'Daisuke Nakamura', 'Hiroki Sugae', 'Yutaka Matsuhiro', 'Shota Okuno', 'Ai Kawamura', 'Kizuku Yamashita', 'Koichi Maeda', 'Kazuo Shimamura', 'Tomoharu Dohi', 'Yasuharu Takeda', 'Yasushi Sakata']",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,2025-04-15,10.1002/ccd.31537,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.31537,,Paid,Impact of Elevated Preprocedural Left Ventricular Filling Pressure on Prognosis of Mild Paravalvular Regurgitation Following Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement KOSUGI 2025,Not available,"['Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Mild Paravalvular Regurgitation', 'Preprocedural Left Ventricular', 'Elevated Preprocedural Left', 'mild PVR', 'Paravalvular Regurgitation', 'Valve Replacement', 'PVR', 'Elevated Preprocedural']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['E/A ratio', 'aortic stenosis', 'brain natriuretic peptide', 'left ventricular filling pressure', 'paravalvular regurgitation', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"
40223618,Optimal Oversizing With the New-Generation Evolut (PRO/PRO+/FX) Self-Expanding Valves: A Multicenter Study.,"BACKGROUND: Paravalvular leaks (PVLs) after transcatheter aortic valve replacement have a significant prognostic impact, and valve oversizing, particularly with self-expanding valves, may prevent postprocedural PVL occurrence. Recent iterations of the Evolut valve system are intended to reduce PVL, but the effects of oversizing with such valves on PVL are largely unknown. We aimed to assess, in a real-world contemporary setting, the impact of Evolut valve oversizing on PVL after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.
METHODS: This was a multicenter observational ambispective study of patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement with the Evolut PRO/PRO+/FX valves. Aortic annulus perimeter, as determined by multidetector computed tomography, was used to estimate the oversizing degree. The primary end point was the presence of PVL (mild/moderate-severe), as determined by echocardiography at hospital discharge. Secondary end points included in-hospital outcomes as defined by the Valve Academic Research Consortium-3 recommendations.
RESULTS: A total of 762 patients were included (Evolut PRO/PRO+/FX, 55.5%/34.8%/9.7%), and the median valve oversizing was 20 (17-25)%, with no differences in baseline characteristics between low (≤20%, n=381) and high (>20%, n=381) valve oversizing recipients. In-hospital mortality and stroke rates were 2.4% and 4.3%, respectively, with no oversizing-related differences in clinical outcomes. Permanent pacemaker rates were similar in patients with low (19.4%) and high (15.8%) valve oversizing, P=0.21. PVL was found in 35.6% of patients (mild: 32.6%, moderate-severe: 3.0%), with a higher incidence of PVL in patients with low (40.9%) versus high (30.2%) oversizing, P=0.002. In a multivariable analysis, a higher oversizing degree was associated with a lower risk of PVL (odds ratio, 0.95 [0.92-0.99] for each 1% increase in oversizing, P=0.006).
CONCLUSIONS: In transcatheter aortic valve replacement with recent Evolut valve iterations (PRO/PRO+/FX), a higher oversizing degree was associated with a lower frequency of PVL without increasing the risk of other complications (including permanent pacemaker). These data suggest that a low degree of valve oversizing should be avoided when using Evolut valves, particularly in borderline cases.","['Silvia Mas-Peiro', 'Alberto Alperi', 'Ander Regueiro', 'Ignacio Cruz Gonzalez', 'Domenico Angellotti', 'Francisco Campelo-Parada', 'Marina Urena', 'Pablo Avanzas', 'Pablo Vidal-Cales', 'Gilles Jose Barreira de Sousa', 'Giovanni Esposito', 'Mehdi Tamir', 'Gaspard Suc', 'Anthony Poulin', 'Siamak Mohammadi', 'Marisa Avvedimento', 'Josep Rodés-Cabau']",Circulation.

40222322,Geriatric assessment and results of transcatheter aortic valve implantation.,"INTRODUCTION: Comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) prior to transcatheter aortic valve replacement implantation (TAVI) for severe aortic stenosis (AS) may improve the selection of patients targeted for this strategy. Despite the fact that CGA includes multiple scales, comparative data among them are limited. Our aim was to evaluate the discriminative capacity of different scales used in CGA on the decision of suitability for TAVI implantation and the influence on prognosis after TAVI implantation.
METHODS: Single-center prospective observational study including consecutive patients with severe AS referred for TAVI implantation. A CGA was performed in all patients including scales of functionality, frailty, cognitive impairment and comorbidities. The predictive capacity of each of the scales was evaluated. The development of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE: cardiovascular mortality, heart failure [HF] and stroke) was analyzed during follow-up.
RESULTS: A total of 142 patients were selected as candidates for TAVI (80.2%), and 121 were finally implanted. The mean age was 83±4.9 years. Patients who were candidates for TAVI had less valvular area, less atrial fibrillation (AF), less cognitive impairment, more autonomy and less frailty. The SPPB frailty and Barthel functional assessment scales were the main scales of the CGA for the TAVI candidacy decision. After TAVI implantation, 21.5% presented a MACE event, with an overall mortality of 19.8% (6.6% cardiovascular). Patients with a higher rate of events and mortality had more AF, HF, renal disease and malnutrition, as well as less family coverage.
CONCLUSIONS: In elderly patients with severe AS, the CGA is a determining factor in the selection of candidates for TAVI, with frailty and functional assessment being the most important aspects. Family support and nutritional status have a high impact on the prognosis of patients after TAVI.","['Cristina de la Rubia-Molina', 'Andrez Felipe Cubides-Novoa', 'María Teresa Madrid-López', 'Elisa Patín-González', 'Verónica Merchán-Ordoñez', 'Martín Negreira-Caamaño', 'Javier Gil-Moreno', 'Alfonso Freites', 'Ignacio Sánchez-Pérez', 'Virginia Mazoteras-Muñoz', 'Jesús Piqueras-Flores']",Medicina clinica,2025-04-12,10.1016/j.medcli.2025.106936,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medcli.2025.106936,,Paid,Geriatric assessment and results of transcatheter aortic valve implantation RUBIA-MOLINA 2025,Not available,"['transcatheter aortic valve', 'TAVI', 'TAVI implantation', 'aortic valve implantation', 'Comprehensive geriatric assessment', 'transcatheter aortic', 'aortic valve', 'CGA', 'aortic valve replacement', 'patients']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Aortic stenosis', 'Cardio-geriatrics', 'Cardiogeriatría', 'Comprehensive geriatric assessment', 'Estenosis aórtica', 'Fragilidad', 'Frailty', 'Implante transcatéter de prótesis aórtica', 'Transcatheter aortic valve implantation', 'Valoración geriátrica integral']"
40214963,Long-term age-stratified outcomes after surgical and transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a Dutch cohort study.,"BACKGROUND: While randomised trials have shown that surgical and transcutaneous aortic valve replacement/implantation (SAVR/TAVI) have similar short- to mid-term outcomes, long-term outcome data are scarce. Additionally, no large-scale long-term follow-up data from Dutch databases and TAVI centres have been reported to inform national guidelines.
METHODS: We retrospectively analysed baseline characteristics, 5‑year mortality and re-intervention rates of patients undergoing isolated SAVR or TAVI, stratified by age (65-75, 75-80 and > 80 years old) in the Netherlands Heart Registry.
RESULTS: From 2013 through 2021, 7879 SAVR patients (median age: 73.0 years; interquartile range (IQR): 69.0-77.0; 43.7% female) and 14,461 TAVI patients (median age: 81.0 years; IQR: 77.0-84.0; 49.9% female) were treated in the Netherlands. Patients undergoing TAVI more frequently had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, dialysis, poor mobility, previous stroke, unstable angina and recent myocardial infarction compared with SAVR patients. This higher comorbidity rate in TAVI was observed across all age groups. After 5‑year follow-up, mortality rates were higher after TAVI compared with SAVR (35.5% vs 13.0%; p < 0.001). This difference decreased with increasing age (p for interaction < 0.001). While the aortic re-intervention rate was low in both cohorts, it was higher after SAVR than TAVI (1.9% vs 0.9%; p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Demographics of patients undergoing SAVR versus TAVI in the Netherlands differed substantially. TAVI patients were older and had more comorbidities than SAVR patients, across all age groups. Mortality rates were highest after TAVI, while aortic re-intervention was more common after SAVR. These findings reflect differences in baseline patient characteristics and current daily practice in decision-making by the Heart Teams.","['Kees van Bergeijk', 'Stijn Venema', 'Ad van den Heuvel', 'Rik van der Werf', 'Wobbe Bouma', 'Yvonne Douglas', 'Niki Medendorp', 'Marijke Timmermans', 'Adriaan Voors', 'Joanna J Wykrzykowska']",Netherlands heart journal : monthly journal of the Netherlands Society of Cardiology and the Netherlands Heart Foundation,2025-05-12,10.1007/s12471-025-01944-5,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12471-025-01944-5,PMC12014882,Free,Long term age stratified outcomes after surgical and transcatheter aortic valve replacement a Dutch cohort study BERGEIJK 2025,pdfs\Long term age stratified outcomes after surgical and transcatheter aortic valve replacement a Dutch cohort study BERGEIJK 2025.pdf,"['TAVI', 'SAVR', 'Netherlands Heart Registry', 'SAVR patients', 'SAVR versus TAVI', 'TAVI patients', 'Netherlands', 'Netherlands Heart', 'patients', 'Heart Registry']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Comorbidities', 'Long-term outcomes', 'SAVR', 'TAVI']"

40187364,"SAPIEN 3 versus Myval transcatheter heart valves for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (COMPARE-TAVI 1): a multicentre, randomised, non-inferiority trial.","BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is a guideline-directed treatment for severe aortic stenosis and degenerated aortic bioprostheses. When new transcatheter heart valve (THV) platforms for TAVI are launched, they should be compared with best-in-practice contemporary THVs for their short-term and long-term performance. The COMPARE-TAVI 1 trial was designed to provide a head-to-head comparison of the SAPIEN 3 or SAPIEN 3 Ultra THVs and the Myval or Myval Octacor THVs.
METHODS: This multicentre, all-comers, randomised, non-inferiority trial was done at three university hospitals in Denmark. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, scheduled for transfemoral TAVI, and eligible for treatment with SAPIEN 3 THVs or Myval THVs. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to treatment with SAPIEN 3 (29 mm diameter) or SAPIEN 3 Ultra (20 mm, 23 mm, or 26 mm diameter) THVs or Myval or Myval Octacor THVs (20-32 mm diameter). The TAVI procedure was performed according to local practice and under local anaesthesia unless leaflet laceration was performed. The primary endpoint was a composite of death, stroke, moderate or severe aortic regurgitation, or moderate or severe haemodynamic THV deterioration at 1 year according to Third Valve Academic Research Consortium criteria. All patients assigned to THV treatment were included in the intention-to-treat analysis, and all patients who were treated as randomly assigned were included in the per-protocol analysis. With an expected event rate of 13%, the prespecified non-inferiority margin was 5·3%. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04443023, and is closed to accrual.
FINDINGS: Between June 15, 2020, and Nov 3, 2023, 1031 patients were enrolled. Enrolment was paused twice because of patent-related legal proceedings. Of 1031 patients, 517 patients were randomly assigned to SAPIEN 3 THVs and 514 to Myval THVs. The median patient age was 81·6 years (IQR 77·6-85·0), and 415 (40%) of 1031 patients were female and 616 (60%) were male. The primary endpoint occurred in 67 (13%) of 517 patients randomly assigned to SAPIEN 3 THVs versus 71 (14%) of 514 patients randomly assigned to Myval THVs (risk difference -0·9% [one-sided upper 95% CI 4·4%]; pnon-inferiority=0·019).
INTERPRETATION: Myval THVs were non-inferior to SAPIEN 3 THVs in terms of a 1-year composite endpoint of death, stroke, moderate or severe aortic regurgitation, or moderate or severe haemodynamic THV deterioration.

40177743,Outcomes of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Low-Risk Patients in the United States: A Report From the STS/ACC TVT Registry.,"BACKGROUND: Real-world low-risk transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) outcomes in the United States have not been assessed comprehensively versus pivotal trials, which is a key component of measuring the quality of clinical technology adoption.
METHODS: We identified heart team-designated low-risk patients undergoing TAVR for trileaflet severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons/American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Registry, as well as a subset of patients who met low-risk trial inclusion and exclusion criteria, from January 2020 to March 2024. Outcomes (mortality, stroke, new pacemaker, and ""alive and well,"" defined as alive at 1 year with Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire score ≥60 and ≤10-point decrease from baseline) at 30 days and 1 year were assessed. Multivariable models were developed to assess predictors of death and stroke within 1 year after TAVR.
RESULTS: Among 383 030 patients who underwent TAVR during the study period, 108 407 (28%) were designated low-risk by the heart team, and 68 194 (18%) met other study inclusion and exclusion criteria. Of these, 62% (n=42 093) would have been eligible for the low-risk trials. In the overall heart team-designated low-risk population, 30-day outcomes included 0.8% mortality, 1.5% stroke, and 8.4% new permanent pacemaker requirement; 1-year outcomes included 4.6% mortality, 2.6% stroke, and 90% alive and well. In the trial-eligible population, 0.6% mortality, 1.4% stroke, and 8.0% new permanent pacemaker requirement had occurred by 30 days; values at 1 year included 3.1% mortality, 2.4% stroke, and 92% alive and well. Notable multivariable predictors of 1-year mortality were atrial fibrillation, nontransfemoral access, and lower baseline Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire score.
CONCLUSIONS: One-year outcomes among real-world trial-eligible patients are excellent, but adverse events are higher compared with published clinical trial data, likely because of greater comorbidity burden and lower baseline Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire score. These data can help inform expected outcomes and health status after low-risk TAVR.","['Andrew M Vekstein', 'Zachary K Wegermann', 'Pratik Manandhar', 'Michael J Mack', 'David J Cohen', 'G Chad Hughes', 'J Kevin Harrison', 'Tsuyoshi Kaneko', 'Samir R Kapadia', 'Konstantinos Stathogiannis', 'William F Fearon', 'Suzanne Arnold', 'Andrzej S Kosinski', 'Martin B Leon', 'Wayne B Batchelor', 'Vinod H Thourani', 'Sreekanth Vemulapalli']",Circulation,2025-04-22,10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.124.071838,https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.124.071838,,Paid,Outcomes of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Low Risk Patients in the United States A Report From the STS/ACC TVT Registry VEKSTEIN 2025,Not available,"['ACC TVT Registry', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'ACC TVT', 'Transcatheter Valve Registry', 'United States', 'City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire', 'Cardiology Transcatheter Valve', 'Kansas City Cardiomyopathy', 'TVT Registry']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['aortic valve stenosis', 'quality of life', 'risk', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"

40159704,Predictive power of ALBI score-based nomogram for 30-day mortality following transcatheter aortic valve implantation.,"AIM: This retrospective, multi-center study evaluates the relationships between novel liver function scoring systems - Albumin-Bilirubin (ALBI) score, EZ-ALBI, PALBI, and MELD-XI - and outcomes in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Feature importance was assessed with SHAP-values via the XGBoost-algorithm.
RESULTS: The ALBI score exhibited the strongest association with 30-day mortality after TAVI (AUC = 0.723, p < 0.001), outperforming other scores in this regard and consistently demonstrating predictive power across various subgroup populations. Higher 30-day mortality rates were observed in the higher tertiles of the ALBI score compared to the lower tertiles (log-rank p-value = 0.004). The ALBI-based nomogram (C-index = 0.81, 95% CI:0.73-0.86, p = 0 < 001) demonstrated superior predictive power for 30-day mortality post-TAVI compared to the STS (C-index = 0.71, 95% CI :0.64-0.77, p = 0 < 001). In addition, the nomogram showed a significant improvement in reclassification (69.3%, p < 0.001) and a stronger discrimination 15.2%, p < 0.001) compared to the STS. It integrates nine variables, first ALBI score (SHAP:1.165), including NYHA class (0.594), body mass index (0.510), glomerular filtration rate, creatinine, hemoglobin, gender, predilatation requirement, presence of chronic kidney disease, and providing a comprehensive risk assessment tool.
CONCLUSION: This study exhibits the significance of liver dysfunction with AS patients and suggests incorporating liver function parameters in pre-operative risk assessments for better clinical outcomes in TAVI procedures.","['Abdullah Yildirim', 'Omer Genc', 'Mert Evlice', 'Aslan Erdogan', 'Emre Pacaci', 'Ahmet Ozderya', 'Murat Gokhan Yerlikaya', 'Emre Sezici', 'Yeliz Guler', 'Omer Sen', 'Ahmet Guler', 'Ali Riza Akyuz', 'Levent Korkmaz', 'Ibrahim Halil Kurt']",Biomarkers in medicine,2025-05-12,10.1080/17520363.2025.2483157,https://doi.org/10.1080/17520363.2025.2483157,PMC12051588,Paid,Predictive power of ALBI score based nomogram for 30 day mortality following transcatheter aortic valve implantation YILDIRIM 2025,Not downloaded,"['aortic valve implantation', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'valve implantation', 'ALBI score-based nomogram', 'aortic valve', 'ALBI score', 'transcatheter aortic', 'undergoing transcatheter aortic', 'ALBI score-based', 'ALBI']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['30-day mortality', 'ALBI', 'ALBI-based nomogram', 'STS PROM', 'TAVI', 'albumin-Bilirubin Score', 'severe aortic stenosis']"
40158212,5-Year Outcomes After Transcatheter or Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement in Low-Risk Patients With Aortic Stenosis.,"BACKGROUND: The Evolut Low Risk trial demonstrated that transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) was noninferior to surgery for the primary endpoint of all-cause mortality or disabling stroke at 2 years. Outcomes at 5 years have not been reported.
OBJECTIVES: This study sought to evaluate 5-year clinical and hemodynamic outcomes with TAVR vs surgery in patients from the Evolut Low Risk trial.
METHODS: We randomly assigned low-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis to TAVR or surgery. The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause mortality or disabling stroke. Secondary endpoints included clinical, echocardiographic, and quality-of-life outcomes through 5 years.
RESULTS: A total of 1,414 patients underwent an attempted implant (n = 730 TAVR, n = 684 surgery). The mean age was 74 years (range 51-88 years), and women accounted for 35% of patients. At 5 years the Kaplan-Meier estimate for the primary endpoint of all-cause mortality or disabling stroke was 15.5% for the TAVR group and 16.4% for the surgery group (P = 0.47). The Kaplan-Meier estimates in the TAVR and surgery groups for all-cause mortality were 13.5% and 14.9% (P = 0.39) and for disabling stroke were 3.6% and 4.0% (P = 0.57). Cardiovascular mortality was 7.2% in the TAVR group and 9.3% in the surgery group (P = 0.15). Noncardiovascular mortality in the TAVR group was 6.8% and 6.2% in the surgery group (P = 0.73). A site-level vital status sweep was performed for patients who were lost to follow-up or withdrew from the study. With the addition of these patients, the all-cause mortality rate at 5 years for patients undergoing TAVR was 14.7% and for surgery was 15.2% (P = 0.74). Over 5 years, valve reintervention rate was 3.3% for TAVR and 2.5% for surgery (P = 0.44). A sustained improvement in quality of life was observed in both treatment arms with mean Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire summary score of 88.3 ± 15.8 in TAVR and 88.5 ± 15.8 in surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: At 5 years, patients with severe aortic stenosis who were treated with either TAVR or surgery had comparable rates of all-cause mortality or disabling stroke. Valve durability and performance were excellent in both arms. This midterm evaluation reinforces the position of TAVR as noninferior to surgery in patients with severe aortic stenosis at low surgical risk (Medtronic Evolut Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Low Risk Patients; NCT02701283).","['John K Forrest', 'Steven J Yakubov', 'G Michael Deeb', 'Hemal Gada', 'Mubashir A Mumtaz', 'Basel Ramlawi', 'Tanvir Bajwa', 'John Crouch', 'William Merhi', 'Stephane Leung Wai Sang', 'Neal S Kleiman', 'George Petrossian', 'Newell B Robinson', 'Paul Sorajja', 'Ayman Iskander', 'Pierre Berthoumieu', 'Didier Tchétché', 'Christopher Feindel', 'Eric M Horlick', 'Shigeru Saito', 'Jae K Oh', 'Yoojin Jung', 'Michael J Reardon']",Journal of the American College of Cardiology,2025-04-22,10.1016/j.jacc.2025.03.004,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2025.03.004,,Paid,5 Year Outcomes After Transcatheter or Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement in Low Risk Patients With Aortic Stenosis FORREST 2025,Not available,"['Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Evolut Low Risk', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'Evolut Transcatheter Aortic', 'TAVR', 'Low Risk', 'Low Risk trial', 'Valve Replacement', 'transcatheter aortic', 'Medtronic Evolut Transcatheter']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['TAVR', 'aortic stenosis', 'low-risk', 'supra-annular self-expanding', 'surgery']"

40117414,Temporal Trends in 1-Year Cause-Specific Mortality After TAVR: Insights From the STS/ACC TVT Registry.,"BACKGROUND: The impact of changing patient demographics and risk profiles on cause-specific mortality after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) remains unclear.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine causes of death (CoDs) and temporal trends and predictors of cause-specific mortality after TAVR.
METHODS: Data from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons/American College of Cardiology TVT (Transcatheter Valve Therapy) Registry were analyzed to identify patients who underwent isolated TAVR between January 2012 and October 2022 who had available information on 1-year CoD. The primary outcome was cause-specific (cardiac and noncardiac) mortality at 1 year. Fine and Gray subdistribution hazard models were used to account for the competing risk for cause-specific death.
RESULTS: Of 36,877 patients who died within 1 year after TAVR and had available information on CoD, 11,560 (31.3%) had cardiac death and 25,317 (68.7%) had noncardiac death. There was an initial decline in the risk-adjusted hazards of 1-year cardiac and noncardiac death after TAVR from 2012 to 2017 (adjusted HR per year: 0.95 [95% CI: 0.92-0.97] and 0.92 [95% CI: 0.90-0.93], respectively), followed by an increase from 2018 to 2022 (adjusted HR per year: 1.07 [95% CI: 1.05-1.09] and 1.22 [95% CI: 1.20-1.24], respectively). Age >80 years, comorbidities, poor functional status, nonelective procedure, nonfemoral access, and in-hospital complications were identified as independent predictors of both cardiac and noncardiac death after TAVR.
CONCLUSIONS: Noncardiac causes account for two-thirds of deaths within 1 year after TAVR. Further studies are needed to examine whether the COVID-19 pandemic, the rapid expansion in the number of TAVR sites, or other patient and hospital characteristics contributed to the increased risk for cardiac and noncardiac death after TAVR in recent years.","['Dhaval Kolte', 'Guillaume Marquis-Gravel', 'Amanda Stebbins', 'Andrew M Vekstein', 'Sreekanth Vemulapalli', 'Sammy Elmariah']",JACC.

40102102,Australian Cardiac Outcomes Registry of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation: Report and Update of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation in Australia.,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) procedures performed in Australia are recorded in the national Australian Cardiac Outcomes Registry (ACOR) TAVI Registry. Characteristics of patients and operators are prospectively collected with reference to patient demographics, procedural factors as well as outcomes related to both efficacy and safety metrics.
METHODS: Patient level data reported to the ACOR TAVI Registry from enrolled sites from registry inception up until 31 December 2021 were analysed. Key safety and efficacy metrics were identified and used to assess TAVI performance and outcomes in the Australian setting.
RESULTS: From 10 April 2018 to 31 December 2021, 9,881 consecutive patients underwent a TAVI procedure in Australia across 42 TAVI hospitals. The mean age of patients treated was 81.8 years (± standard deviation [SD] 7.1 years), 40.6% were female and the mean STS (Society for Thoracic Surgeons) score was 5.3% (±SD 4.4%). Overall, 0.3% of the cohort identified as Australian Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander peoples. All-cause mortality at 30 days and 12 months was 1.37% and 5.57% respectively. The 30-day rates of stroke, major vascular complications and newly implanted permanent pacemaker were 2.19%, 1.23% and 10.68% respectively. There were 181 unique primary operators who performed TAVI during this time with an annualised median number of 19 procedures per operator per year (interquartile range [IQR] 42.5) and 63% of operators performed <30 cases per year.

40007245,Aortic Root Anatomy and Impact on New-Onset Left Bundle Branch Block After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.,"BACKGROUND: Angulation of virtual basal ring (VBR), also known as aortic annulus, in relation to sino-tubular junction (STJ) may lead to greater exposure of implanted stent to the conduction system, consequently increasing the risk of left bundle branch block (LBBB).
AIMS: We sough to measure the VBR-STJ angle and explore its impact on the development of LBBB post-TAVR.
METHODS: Patients undergoing TAVR using the Sapiens 3 valve between 2016 and 2021, without pre-TAVR conduction anomalies were included. The angle between the VBR and the ascending aorta was measured as the angle between the VBR plane and the plane of the STJ on cardiac CT, along with the annulus dimensions. TAVR implantation depth was measured on fluoroscopy images.
RESULTS: A total of 1204 patients were included, with 145 having new-onset LBBB. The VBR-STJ angle was significantly greater in the new-onset LBBB group (7.3 ± 4.7 vs. 5.9 ± 4.6, p = 0.002), and the difference in implantation depth between the levels of right and none coronary cusp (RCC and NCC) was significantly correlated with the VBR-STJ angle (r = 0.3, p = 0.03). This angle was further associated with new-onset LBBB after adjustment to patient and procedural characteristics (OR 1.08 CI: [1.04, 1.13], p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Patients developing LBBB have larger VBR-STJ angle which was associated with greater depth of implantation of the TAVR valve below the RCC compared to the NCC. Precise understanding of the aortic root anatomy can help to predict onset of LBBB which in turn can inform decision-making regarding optimal way of treating aortic stenosis and may improve procedure planning.","['Habib Layoun', 'Joseph Kassab', 'Michel Chedid El Helou', 'Joseph El Dahdah', 'Odette Iskandar', 'Maryam Muhammad Ali Majeed Saidan', 'Abdelrahman Abushouk', 'Toshiaki Isogai', 'Grant Reed', 'Rishi Puri', 'Oussama M Wazni', 'Amar Krishnaswamy', 'Serge Harb', 'Samir Kapadia']",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,2025-05-12,10.1002/ccd.31434,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.31434,PMC12057298,Free,Aortic Root Anatomy and Impact on New Onset Left Bundle Branch Block After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation LAYOUN 2025,pdfs\Aortic Root Anatomy and Impact on New Onset Left Bundle Branch Block After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation LAYOUN 2025.pdf,"['LBBB', 'TAVR', 'Left Bundle Branch', 'Aortic Root Anatomy', 'Bundle Branch Block', 'onset LBBB', 'VBR', 'STJ angle', 'Patients undergoing TAVR', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['aortic root', 'left bundle branch block', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"
39989358,Aortic Valve Calcification Is Induced by the Loss of ALDH1A1 and Can Be Prevented by Agonists of Retinoic Acid Receptor Alpha: Preclinical Evidence for Drug Repositioning.,"BACKGROUND: To date, the only effective treatment of severe aortic stenosis is valve replacement. With the introduction of transcatheter aortic valve replacement and extending indications to younger patients, the use of bioprosthetic valves (BPVs) has considerably increased. The main inconvenience of BPVs is their limited durability because of mechanisms similar as the fibro-calcifying processes observed in native aortic stenosis. One of the major gaps of the field is to identify therapeutic targets to prevent or slow the fibro-calcifying process leading to severe and symptomatic aortic stenosis.
METHODS: Explanted valves were collected from patients and organ donor hearts. A comparative transcriptomic analysis was performed on valvular interstitial cells (VIC) obtained from calcified (bicuspid and tricuspid) versus control valves. The mechanisms and consequences of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member A1 (ALDH1A1) downregulation were analyzed in VIC cultures from control human aortic valves. ALDH1A1 was inhibited or silenced and its impact on osteogenic marker expression and calcification processes assessed in VIC. The effect of all-trans retinoic acid on calcification was tested on human VIC cultures and on 2 animal models: the model of subcutaneous implantation of bovine pericardium in rats and the model of xenograft aortic valve replacement in juvenile sheep.
RESULTS: Transcriptome analysis of human VIC identified ALDH1A1 as the most downregulated gene in VIC from calcified versus control valves. In human VIC, ALDH1A1 expression is downregulated by TGF-β in a SMAD2/3-dependent manner. ALDH1A1 inhibition promotes an osteoblast-like VIC phenotype and increases calcium deposition through inhibition of retinoic acid receptor alpha signaling. Conversely, VIC treatment with retinoids decreases calcium deposition and attenuates VIC osteoblast activity. Last, all-trans retinoic acid inhibits calcification development of aortic BPV in both in vivo models and improves aortic valve echocardiographic parameters in the xenograft sheep model.
CONCLUSIONS: These results show that ALDH1A1 is downregulated in calcified valves, hence promoting VIC transition into an osteoblastic phenotype. Retinoic acid receptor alpha agonists, including all-trans retinoic acid through a drug repositioning strategy, represent a promising and innovative pharmacological approach to prevent calcification of native aortic valves and BPV.","['Mickael Rosa', 'Annabelle Dupont', 'David M Smadja', 'Jérôme Soquet', 'Johan Abdoul', 'Thibault Pamart', 'Flavien Vincent', 'Christina Le Tanno', 'Eloise Borowczak', 'Timothée Bigot', 'Alexandre Ung', 'Bertrand Vaast', 'Mélanie Daniel', 'Ramadan Jashari', 'Frédéric Mouquet', 'Cedric Delhaye', 'Yoann Sottejeau', 'Jeanne Rancic', 'Delphine Corseaux', 'Francis Juthier', 'Bart Staels', 'Sophie Susen', 'Eric Van Belle']",Circulation,2025-05-06,10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.124.071954,https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.124.071954,,Paid,Aortic Valve Calcification Is Induced by the Loss of ALDH1A1 and Can Be Prevented by Agonists of Retinoic Acid Receptor Alpha Preclinical Evidence for Drug Repositioning ROSA 2025,Not available,"['Preclinical Evidence', 'VIC', 'Retinoic Acid', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor', 'Aortic', 'Aortic Valve', 'aortic valve replacement', 'Acid Receptor Alpha', 'all-trans retinoic acid', 'human VIC']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['ALDH1A1', 'aortic valve stenosis', 'bioprosthetic valves', 'calcification', 'retinoids', 'valvular interstitial cells']"
39981654,Impact of Continuation Versus Interruption of Oral Anticoagulation During TAVI on Health-Related Quality of Life.,"BACKGROUND: One-third of patients undergoing TAVR have a concomitant indication for oral anticoagulation. The impact of continuation as compared to interruption of oral anticoagulation during TAVR on health-related quality of life is unknown.
AIMS: To investigate the impact of continuation as compared to interruption of oral anticoagulation on health-related quality of life.
METHODS: The POPular PAUSE TAVI (Periprocedural Continuation vs. Interruption of Oral Anticoagulant Drugs during Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation) trial was an international, open-label, randomized, clinical trial performed at 22 European sites. Health-related quality of life was assessed using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) and Short Form-12 (SF-12) before, and at 1 and 3 months after TAVR.
RESULTS: A total of 8 patients were included: 431 were assigned to continuation and 427 to interruption of oral anticoagulation. Before TAVR, the mean overall KCCQ summary score was 53.6 (±26.0). At 1 month, the mean change in KCCQ summary score as compared to baseline was +11.4 points (95% confidence interval [CI] 8.0-14.8) in the continuation group and +12.2 points (95% CI 8.8-15.6) in the interruption group (difference -0.7 points; 95% CI -4.6 to 3.1). At 3 months, the mean change was +11.0 points (95% CI 7.3-14.6) versus +13.8 points (95% CI 10.2-17.4), respectively (difference -2.8 points; 95% CI -7.1 to 1.5). Mean changes in SF-12 physical and mental component summary scores showed no differences between both groups at 1 and 3 months after TAVR.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing TAVR with a concomitant indication for oral anticoagulation, continuation as compared to interruption of oral anticoagulation during TAVR did not significantly impact health-related quality of life up to 3 months after TAVR.","['Dirk Jan van Ginkel', 'Willem L Bor', 'Hugo M Aarts', 'Christophe Dubois', 'Ole De Backer', 'Maxim J P Rooijakkers', 'Liesbeth Rosseel', 'Leo Veenstra', 'Ronak Delewi', 'Jurriën M Ten Berg']",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,2025-05-12,10.1002/ccd.31457,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.31457,,Paid,Impact of Continuation Versus Interruption of Oral Anticoagulation During TAVI on Health Related Quality of Life GINKEL 2025,Not available,"['Oral Anticoagulation', 'Interruption of Oral', 'Quality of Life', 'Health-Related Quality', 'Oral', 'TAVR', 'Anticoagulation', 'Oral Anticoagulant Drugs', 'Interruption', 'impact health-related quality']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['KCCQ', 'TAVI', 'anticoagulation', 'bleeding', 'quality of life', 'stroke']"
39980355,Optimizing Device Selection in Percutaneous Paravalvular Leak Closure: A Comparative Study of Different Transthoracic and Transesophageal Echocardiographic Techniques.,"BACKGROUND: Clinically significant paravalvular leak (PVL) may complicate both surgical and transcatheter valve implantation. Percutaneous PVL closure (PPVLC) is becoming an increasingly attractive alternative to redo surgery, with demonstrated lower mortality and morbidity rates. Echocardiographic techniques are crucial for accurate diagnosis, defect sizing, and determining the appropriate size of the sealing devices.
AIMS: There is no consensus on the optimal imaging modality for PVLs. We aimed to compare transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiographic measurements to accurately determine defect size and estimate device size.
METHODS: We reviewed hospital records to identify patients diagnosed with moderate to severe and severe PVL from 2018 to 2024. A total of 81 patients who underwent PPVLC were evaluated. Eight of these patients were excluded due to unsuccessful PPVLC, leaving 73 patients who were successfully treated. The defect size for all patients was evaluated using 2D transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), 2D transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), direct 3D TEE cropped volume rendering vena contracta (VC) measurement, and 3D TEE multiplanar reconstruction (3D TEE MPR).
RESULTS: Among the 73 patients, 42 underwent aortic PPVLC and 31 underwent mitral PPVLC. Proportional odds logistic regression analysis identified 3D TEE MPR measurement as the strongest predictor of device size accuracy, both overall and within the aortic/mitral subgroups. In the mitral subgroup, the predictive power of direct 3D TEE cropped volume rendering VC measurement and 3D TEE MPR measurement were similar. Furthermore, a cut-off value of 7 mm was identified for hemodynamically significant jets as measured by 3D methods.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that using 3D TEE MPR significantly improves the accuracy of device size selection in both mitral and aortic PVL. Additionally, direct 3D TEE cropped volume rendering VC measurement can serve as a viable alternative for patients with mitral PVL.","['Meltem Tekin', 'Gamze Babur Güler', 'Mehmet Çiçek', 'İbrahim Halil Tanboğa', 'Piotr Pysz', 'Arda Güler', 'Ali Rıza Demir', 'Yusuf Efe', 'Sezgin Atmaca', 'Dilara Pay', 'Ali Kemal Kalkan', 'Mehmet Ertürk']",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,2025-05-12,10.1002/ccd.31448,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.31448,,Paid,Optimizing Device Selection in Percutaneous Paravalvular Leak Closure A Comparative Study of Different Transthoracic and Transesophageal Echocardiographic Techniques TEKIN 2025,Not available,"['Comparative Study', 'Paravalvular Leak Closure', 'Percutaneous Paravalvular Leak', 'TEE MPR', 'Paravalvular Leak', 'TEE', 'TEE MPR measurement', 'Percutaneous PVL closure', 'TEE cropped volume', 'significant paravalvular leak']",2025-05-12,Pending,[]
39971704,Impact of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation on Right Ventricular Function.,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence and predictors of right ventricular (RV) dysfunction before and after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) are not known. We aimed to document this and sought to identify specific RV echo thresholds, below which RV improvement was unlikely to occur.
METHOD: Consecutive patients who underwent TAVI between 2017 and 2021 at Macquarie University Hospital (MUH) were included if ≥2 RV functional parameters were available on baseline echo; tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, tissue Doppler (S') and/or RV fractional area change. Prevalence and predictors of baseline RV dysfunction were documented. Patients with a repeat echo performed at MUH at 1-3 months post-TAVI were included in further analyses to assess serial changes in RV function.
RESULTS: Overall, 343 patients had an eligible baseline echo and 97 of these patients (28.2%) had RV dysfunction, pre-TAVI. These patients had significantly higher rates of atrial fibrillation, ischaemic heart disease, and chronic lung disease, than those without (p<0.05 for all). Of 239 patients with 1-3 month follow-up echo data, 66 of these had had baseline RV dysfunction; of these, 20 (30.3%) patients showed improvement and 46 (69.7%) patients showed persistent RV dysfunction. Thresholds with a greater than 90% predictive value for persistent RV dysfunction were identified for each baseline RV functional parameter: tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion <1.4 cm, S'<6, fractional area change <25%.
CONCLUSIONS: Baseline RV dysfunction was present in over a quarter of pre-TAVI patients and persisted at short-term follow-up in over two-thirds of such patients. There were clear thresholds to identify patients where RV recovery was unlikely, after TAVI.","['Seshika Ratwatte', 'Bianca Coelho', 'Martin K Ng', 'David S Celermajer']","Heart, lung & circulation",2025-05-12,10.1016/j.hlc.2024.11.017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hlc.2024.11.017,,Paid,Impact of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation on Right Ventricular Function RATWATTE 2025,Not available,"['Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Aortic Valve Implantation', 'Aortic Valve', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'Valve Implantation', 'patients', 'Macquarie University Hospital', 'dysfunction', 'Ventricular Function', 'baseline']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Aortic stenosis', 'Right ventricular dysfunction', 'Transcatheter aortic valve implantation']"
39965432,Machine learning for predicting outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve implantation: A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) therapy has demonstrated its clear benefits such as low invasiveness, to treat aortic stenosis. Despite associated benefits, still post-procedural complications might occur. The severity of these complications depends on pre-existing clinical conditions and patient specific complex anatomical features. Accurate prediction of TAVI outcomes will assist in the precise risk assessment for patients undergoing TAVI. Throughout the past decade, different machine learning (ML) approaches have been utilized to predict outcomes of TAVI. This systematic review aims to assess the application of ML in TAVI for the purpose of outcome prediction.
METHODS: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline was adapted for searching the PubMed and Scopus databases on ML use in TAVI outcomes prediction. Once the studies that meet the inclusion criteria were identified, data from these studies were retrieved and were further examined. 17 parameters relevant to TAVI outcomes were carefully identified for assessing the quality of the included studies.
RESULTS: Following the search of the mentioned databases, 78 studies were initially retrieved, and 17 of these studies were included for further assessment. Most of the included studies focused on mortality prediction, utilizing datasets of varying sizes and diverse ML algorithms. The most employed ML algorithms were random forest, logistics regression, and gradient boosting. Among the studied parameters, serum creatinine, age, BMI, hemoglobin, and aortic valve mean gradient were identified as key predictors for TAVI outcomes. These predictors were found to be well aligned with established associations in current literature.
CONCLUSION: ML presents a promising opportunity for improving the success and safety of TAVI and enhancing patient-centered care. While currently retrospective studies with low generalizability and heterogeneity form the basis of ML TAVI research, future prospective investigations with highly heterogeneous patient TAVI cohorts will be critically important for firmly establishing the applicability of ML in predicting TAVI outcomes.","['Ruba Sulaiman', 'Md Ahasan Atick Faisal', 'Maram Hasan', 'Muhammad E H Chowdhury', 'Faycal Bensaali', 'Abdulrahman Alnabti', 'Huseyin C Yalcin']",International journal of medical informatics,2025-05-12,10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2025.105840,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2025.105840,,Paid,Machine learning for predicting outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve implantation A systematic review SULAIMAN 2025,Not available,"['transcatheter aortic valve', 'aortic valve implantation', 'TAVI outcomes', 'TAVI', 'transcatheter aortic', 'aortic valve', 'valve implantation', 'TAVI outcomes prediction', 'outcomes', 'aortic']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Aortic stenosis', 'Deep learning', 'Machine learning', 'Outcome prediction', 'TAVI', 'TAVR', 'Transcatheter aortic valve implantation']"
39924368,Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation in Patients at Intermediate and Low Risk Is Not (Yet) the Existential Threat That Surgeons Feared: A Retrospective Analysis of Medicare Claims Data.,"BACKGROUND: In Australia, the role of surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) and transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in patients who are suitable for both procedures remains controversial. In 2022, new Items were added to the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) to allow patients at intermediate and low risk with appropriate private health insurance to undergo TAVI. The Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand supported these changes whereas the Australian and New Zealand Society of Cardiac and Thoracic Surgeons opposed them. The aim of this study was to document subsequent private TAVI activity in patients at intermediate and low risk, relative to both private TAVI activity in patients at high risk and private SAVR activity.
METHOD: A retrospective population-level descriptive study was undertaken, using Medicare claims data obtained from Services Australia.
RESULTS: Among private patients who underwent TAVI, the groups at high, intermediate, and low risk all had a median age between 75 and 84 years. Only 1% were aged ≤64 years (86/6,586), and 80% of these were at high risk (69/86). Among private patients at intermediate and low risk who underwent TAVI and private patients who underwent SAVR, only 4% of patients aged 55-64 years chose private TAVI over private SAVR (8/211), and 63% of these were at intermediate risk (5/8).
CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of MBS Items for private TAVI in patients at intermediate and low risk without accompanying age exclusion criteria has not (yet) had a major impact on private SAVR activity. This suggests that the multidisciplinary heart team (TAVI case conference) approval process remains an effective mechanism for ensuring access to private TAVI is consistent with international guidelines.",['Jonathon B Ryan'],"Heart, lung & circulation",2025-05-12,10.1016/j.hlc.2024.11.022,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hlc.2024.11.022,,Paid,Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation in Patients at Intermediate and Low Risk Is Not Yet the Existential Threat That Surgeons Feared A Retrospective Analysis of Medicare Claims Data RYAN 2025,Not available,"['Aortic Valve Implantation', 'Existential Threat', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Aortic Valve', 'Surgeons Feared', 'Medicare Claims Data', 'Valve Implantation', 'aortic valve replacement', 'surgical aortic valve', 'Medicare Benefits Schedule']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Aortic stenosis', 'Multidisciplinary heart team', 'Shared decision-making', 'Surgical aortic valve replacement', 'Transcatheter aortic valve implantation']"

39903642,The reversibility of cardiac damage after transcatheter aortic valve implantation and short-term outcomes in a real-world setting.,"AIMS: This study aims to assess the changes in cardiac damage stage in a real-world cohort of patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), and to investigate the prognostic value of cardiac damage stage evolution.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing TAVI were retrospectively analysed. A five-stage system based on the presence and extent of cardiac damage assessed by echocardiography was applied before and 6 months after TAVI. Multivariable Cox regression analyses were used to examine independent prognostic value of the changes in cardiac damage after TAVI. A total of 734 patients with severe AS (mean age, 79.8 ± 7.4 years; 55% male) were included. Before TAVI, 32 (4%) patients did not show any sign of extra-valvular cardiac damage (Stage 0), 85 (12%) had left ventricular damage (Stage 1), 220 (30%) left atrial and/or mitral valve damage (Stage 2), 227 (31%) pulmonary vasculature and/or tricuspid valve damage (Stage 3), and 170 (23%) right ventricular damage (Stage 4). Six months after TAVI, 39% of the patients improved at least one stage in cardiac damage. Staging of cardiac damage at 6 months after TAVI [hazard ratio (HR) per one-stage increase, 1.391; P = 0.035] as well as worsening in the stage of cardiac damage (HR, 3.729; P = 0.005) were independently associated with 2-year all-cause mortality.
CONCLUSION: More than one-third of patients with severe AS showed an improvement in cardiac damage 6 months after TAVI.

39894430,Paravalvular Leak After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation: Results From 3600 Patients.,"BACKGROUND: Paravalvular leak (PVL) after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is associated with poor outcomes. Mild PVL remains prevalent after TAVI, and its impact on long-term survival is unclear. This study aimed to examine the incidence, impact on survival, and progression of PVL.
METHODS: This was a retrospective, single-institution cohort study of TAVIs between November 2012 and January 2023. Patients were stratified by 30-day PVL severity: none to trace, mild, and moderate to severe. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify risk factors associated with increasing PVL severity. Kaplan-Meier survival estimation and Cox proportional hazards regression were performed.
RESULTS: A total of 3600 patients underwent TAVI. Of these, 2719 (75.5%) had none to trace PVL, 808 (22.5%) had mild PVL, and 73 (2.0%) had moderate to severe PVL at 30 days. On multivariable logistic regression, later years of valve implantation (2017-2023) were protective against PVL progression. Kaplan-Meier estimates of the 3 groups were significantly different (P < .001) with the moderate to severe group having reduced survival. On Cox regression, moderate to severe PVL was associated with increased mortality (hazard ratio, 1.80; 95% Cl, 1.31-2.46; P < .001), whereas mild PVL was not (hazard ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.89-1.15; P = .88) compared with none to trace PVL. For Kaplan-Meier estimates comparing the none to trace and mild PVL groups alone, landmark analysis showed reduced survival in the mild PVL group after 2 years (P = .03); however, this late reduction in survival in the mild PVL group did not persist on multivariable analysis (P = .14).
CONCLUSIONS: After TAVI, moderate to severe PVL is associated with reduced survival compared with none to trace PVL. Mild PVL may result in a delayed survival reduction.","['Nav Warraich', 'James A Brown', 'Eishan Ashwat', 'Dustin Kliner', 'Derek Serna-Gallegos', 'Catalin Toma', 'David West', 'Amber Makani', 'Yisi Wang', 'Ibrahim Sultan']",The Annals of thoracic surgery,2025-05-12,10.1016/j.athoracsur.2025.01.012,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.athoracsur.2025.01.012,,Paid,Paravalvular Leak After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation Results From 3600 Patients WARRAICH 2025,Not available,"['Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Aortic Valve Implantation', 'PVL', 'Mild PVL', 'Paravalvular Leak', 'Valve Implantation', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'Aortic Valve', 'severe PVL', 'trace PVL']",2025-05-12,Pending,[]

39855450,Outcomes and Predictors of Different Flow-Gradient Patterns of Aortic Stenosis After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.,"This study sought to explore the clinical factors associated with classical low-flow low-gradient (C-LFLG) and normal-flow low-gradient (NFLG) aortic stenosis (AS) compared with high-gradient (HG) AS. We also compared clinical and echocardiographic outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) across flow-gradient patterns. Patients with C-LFLG AS have a higher mortality rate after TAVR than those with HG AS. However, what leads to C-LFLG AS and the predictors of mortality in this population remain unclear. In this retrospective, single-center study involving 1,415 patients with severe AS, patients were classified as having (1) HG AS (aortic valve mean gradient [MG] >40 mm Hg), (2) C-LFLG AS (MG <40 mm Hg, stroke volume index <35 ml/m2, left ventricular ejection fraction <50%), and (3) NFLG AS (MG <40 mm Hg, stroke volume index ≥35 ml/m2, left ventricular ejection fraction ≥50%). Logistic regression was used for predictors of C-LFLG AS. Cox regression was used for predictors of mortality in the C-LFLG AS population. Male gender, multiple co-morbidities, and moderate to severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation correlated with the C-LFLG AS group. Patients with C-LFLG AS had a higher mortality risk compared with patients with HG AS at 2 years after TAVR. Patients with NFLG AS had similar mortality at 1 year, but higher mortality at 2 years after TAVR compared with patients with HG AS. End-stage renal disease, atrial fibrillation, and other co-morbidities were predictors of 2-year mortality in patients with C-LFLG AS. In conclusion, the mortality rate after TAVR was higher among patients with C-LFLG AS than those with HG AS. Male gender and multiple co-morbidities were predictors of C-LFLG AS. Multiple co-morbidities were predictors of mortality among those patients.","['Besir Besir', 'Shivabalan Kathavarayan Ramu', 'Maryam Muhammad Ali Majeed-Saidan', 'Judah Rajendran', 'Odette Iskandar', 'Grant Reed', 'Rishi Puri', 'James Yun', 'Serge Harb', 'Rhonda Miyasaka', 'Amar Krishnaswamy', 'Zoran Popovic', 'Samir R Kapadia']",The American journal of cardiology,2025-05-01,10.1016/j.amjcard.2025.01.019,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjcard.2025.01.019,,Paid,Outcomes and Predictors of Different Flow Gradient Patterns of Aortic Stenosis After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement BESIR 2025,Not available,"['Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Aortic Stenosis', 'Aortic Valve', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'C-LFLG', 'Valve Replacement', 'Aortic', 'Patients', 'mortality']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['aortic stenosis', 'classical low-flow low-gradient (C-LFLG) AS', 'high-gradient (HG) AS', 'normal-flow low-gradient (NFLG) AS', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR)']"

39710301,Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Aortic Stenosis Patients With New York Heart Association Functional Class III or IV.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with symptomatic aortic stenosis are a vulnerable population with associated cardiac damage and a significant comorbidity burden. In this study we aimed to determine the rate, factors associated with, and prognostic value of poor functional status (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class III-IV) in patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
METHODS: This multicenter study included 6363 transarterial TAVR patients, classified according to baseline functional status (NYHA class I or II vs III or IV).
RESULTS: A total of 3800 (60%) patients presented with NYHA class III or IV before the TAVR procedure. Atrial fibrillation (odds ratio [OR], 1.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-1.58; P = 0.002), chronic kidney disease (CKD; OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.45-2.05; P < 0.001), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; OR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.32-2.05; P < 0.001), reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (OR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.70-3.05; P < 0.001), and moderate and severe pulmonary hypertension were associated with a poor functional status. At 1-year follow-up, patients with NYHA class III or IV had higher rates of mortality (8.81 per 100 person-years [95% CI, 7.57-10.15] vs 13.12 per 100 person-years [95% CI, 11.80-14.58]; log rank, P < 0.001) and heart failure hospitalization (8.25 per 100 person-years [95% CI, 7.05-9.65] vs 12.5 per 100 person-years [95% CI, 11.24-14.00]; log rank, P = 0.005). Comorbidity factors (COPD, CKD) and signs of cardiac damage (atrial fibrillation, pulmonary hypertension) determined an increased risk of poorer clinical outcomes (P < 0.01 for all).
CONCLUSIONS: More than half of the patients undergoing TAVR in the contemporary era have presented with advanced functional class before the procedure, and this was associated with a greater comorbidity and cardiac damage burden. Patients with poorer baseline functional status exhibited worse clinical outcomes at 1-year follow-up. These findings highlight the need for further study on earlier interventions for patients with aortic stenosis.","['Jorge Nuche', 'Jules Mesnier', 'Julien Ternacle', 'Effat Rezaei', 'Francisco Campelo-Parada', 'Marina Urena', 'Gabriela Veiga-Fernandez', 'Luis Nombela-Franco', 'Anna Franzone', 'Antonio J Munoz-Garcia', 'Victoria Vilalta', 'Ander Regueiro', 'David Del Val', 'Lluis Asmarats', 'Maria Del Trigo', 'Vicenç Serra', 'Guillaume Bonnet', 'Melchior Jonveaux', 'Ronan Canitrot', 'Dominique Himbert', 'Jose Maria de la Torre Hernandez', 'Gabriela Tirado-Conte', 'Eduard Fernandez-Nofrerias', 'Pedro Cepas', 'Fernando Alfonso', 'Lola Gutierrez-Alonso', 'Juan Francisco Oteo', 'Yassin Belahnech', 'Siamak Mohammadi', 'Thomas Modine', 'Marisa Avvedimento', 'Josep Rodés-Cabau', 'Asim N Cheema']",The Canadian journal of cardiology,2025-05-12,10.1016/j.cjca.2024.12.025,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2024.12.025,,Paid,Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Aortic Stenosis Patients With New York Heart Association Functional Class III or IV NUCHE 2025,Not available,"['York Heart Association', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'NYHA class III', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Aortic Stenosis', 'Heart Association Functional', 'York Heart', 'Heart Association', 'Association Functional Class', 'Class III']",2025-05-12,Pending,[]
39667494,Clinical Outcomes in Atrial Fibrillation Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement With Contemporary Devices.,"BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) has been identified as a marker of advanced cardiac damage in patients with aortic stenosis. However, the factors associated with poorer outcomes among AF patients in contemporary transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) practice, particularly regarding mortality and heart failure (HF)-related hospitalizations, remain largely unknown.
METHODS: In this multicenter study, we assessed consecutive patients with a history of AF and evaluated the clinical outcomes of those who underwent TAVR with newer generation devices using either balloon- or self-expandable valves.
RESULTS: A total of 3476 patients were included in the study. After a median follow-up of 2 (interquartile range, 1-4) years, 36.1% patients had died, with 51.5% of deaths being cardiovascular-related, including 15.6% from HF. HF-related hospitalizations post-TAVR accounted for 34.8% of all hospitalizations and were associated with a higher mortality risk (hazard ratio [HR], 1.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.32-1.81; P < 0.001). Permanent AF was identified as an independent predictor of all-cause mortality or HF-related hospitalizations (HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.10-1.40; P < 0.001), as did other baseline characteristics, including chronic kidney disease (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.09-1.38; P = 0.001), anemia (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.07-1.36; P = 0.002), and New York Heart Association functional class III or IV (HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.01-1.27; P = 0.045). In addition, early postprocedural complications, including stroke and bleeding, also significantly increased the risk of mortality (HR, 5.52; 95% CI, 3.12-9.79; P < 0.001) and HF-related hospitalizations (HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.03-1.33; P = 0.014).
CONCLUSIONS: AF patients exhibited a high risk of mortality and HF-related hospitalizations in a contemporary TAVR cohort. Several baseline comorbidities and periprocedural complications, along with permanent (vs paroxysmal) AF, were associated with poorer outcomes. These findings confirm the negative impact of AF despite the continued improvements in TAVR technology and underscore the importance of early intervention and optimization of HF management to improve outcomes in this high-risk population.","['Siddhartha Mengi', 'Pedro Cepas-Guillén', 'Julien Ternacle', 'Marina Urena', 'Alberto Alperi', 'Asim N Cheema', 'Gabriela Veiga-Fernandez', 'Luis Nombela-Franco', 'Victoria Vilalta', 'Giovanni Esposito', 'Francisco Campelo-Parada', 'Ciro Indolfi', 'Maria Del Trigo', 'Antonio Muñoz-Garcia', 'Nicolas Maneiro', 'Lluís Asmarats', 'Ander Regueiro', 'David Del Val', 'Vicenç Serra', 'Vincent Auffret', 'Lionel Leroux', 'Thomas Modine', 'Jules Mesnier', 'Gaspard Suc', 'Pablo Avanzas', 'Effat Rezaei', 'Victor Fradejas-Sastre', 'Gabriela Tirado-Conte', 'Eduard Fernández-Nofrerias', 'Domenico Angellotti', 'Thibaut Guitteny', 'Sabato Sorrentino', 'Juan Francisco Oteo', 'Felipe Díez-Delhoyo', 'Lola Gutiérrez-Alonso', 'Pablo Vidal-Calés', 'Fernando Alfonso', 'Andrea Monastyrski', 'Maxime Nolf', 'Marisa Avvedimento', 'Josep Rodés-Cabau']",The Canadian journal of cardiology,2025-05-12,10.1016/j.cjca.2024.12.007,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2024.12.007,,Paid,Clinical Outcomes in Atrial Fibrillation Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement With Contemporary Devices MENGI 2025,Not available,"['Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic', 'Fibrillation Patients Undergoing', 'Patients Undergoing Transcatheter', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Atrial Fibrillation Patients', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Undergoing Transcatheter', 'contemporary transcatheter aortic', 'Patients Undergoing']",2025-05-12,Pending,[]
39667492,Four-dimensional Cardiac Modelling of Multiphase Computed Tomography for Predicting Outcomes After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.,"BACKGROUND: Multiphase computed tomography angiography (mpCTA) is routinely performed prior to transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) to determine eligibility and enable preprocedural planning. Incremental prognostic value may be realized from full-cycle, multiphase reconstructions to assess the contractile health of the cardiac chambers. In this study we assessed the feasibility of 4-dimensional chamber modelling of the left ventricle (LV) to support 3-dimensional minimum principal strain (3DminPS)-based predictions of clinical outcomes after TAVR.
METHODS: Two hundred five patients undergoing pre-TAVR mpCTA were studied. UNet-based 3D chamber segmentation was followed by mesh modelling and 3D feature tracking-based deformation to determine global 3DminPS for endocardial, epicardial, and transmural layers. Independent associations of 3DminPS with the primary outcome of heart failure hospitalization or death are described.
RESULTS: Of the 205 patients studied, 196 (96%) had analyzable mpCTAs (median age, 85 years; 55% male; Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality score = 3.10; 60.0% echocardiographic LV ejection fraction). At a median of 25 months after TAVR, 55 patients (28%) experienced the primary outcome. After adjustment for baseline variables, patients with an endocardial 3DminPS amplitude worse than -23.7% experienced a 2.7-fold higher risk of the outcome (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-5.1; P = 0.001), with this high-risk cohort having 1- and 3-year event rates of 32% and 49%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Four-dimensional chamber modelling of mpCTA using UNet-based segmentation and standardized mesh deformation is feasible and enables delivery of 3D deformation markers with strong prognostic value for the prediction of outcomes after TAVR. Prospective validation in a multicentre setting is currently being undertaken.","['Mohamad Rabbani', 'Ali Fatehi Hassanabad', 'Alessandro Satriano', 'Dina Labib', 'Carmen P Lydell', 'Michael Bristow', 'Anna Bizios', 'Corey Adams', 'Muhammad Mustafa Alhussein', 'Steven Dykstra', 'Jacqueline Flewitt', 'Sandra Rivest', 'William Kent', 'Zhiying Liang', 'Tianqi Tao', 'Andrew G Howarth', 'Elena Di Martino', 'Nowell M Fine', 'Michael W A Chu', 'James A White']",The Canadian journal of cardiology,2025-05-12,10.1016/j.cjca.2024.12.008,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2024.12.008,,Paid,Four dimensional Cardiac Modelling of Multiphase Computed Tomography for Predicting Outcomes After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement RABBANI 2025,Not available,"['Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Multiphase Computed Tomography', 'Valve Replacement', 'computed tomography angiography', 'Aortic Valve', 'Computed Tomography', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'Multiphase Computed', 'Predicting Outcomes']",2025-05-12,Pending,[]
39667491,Clinical Outcomes of Patients With Bicuspid Aortic Valve Undergoing a Targeted Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Approach: The LIRA Method.,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in patients with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) disease is still burdened by a non-negligible rate of stroke and permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI). These suboptimal results, possibly related to the unique BAV anatomy, may suggest the use of a different sizing method in this setting. The aim of our study is to evaluate whether the application of the supra-annular LIRA method may improve clinical outcomes in this population.
METHODS: In this single-center retrospective study, we enrolled consecutive patients with severe aortic stenosis and raphe-type BAV undergone TAVR with the implantation of supra-annular self-expanding prostheses sized according to the LIRA method. The primary endpoint was the device success. Secondary endpoints were in-hospital and 30-day safety outcomes and 1-year clinical efficacy. All study endpoints were adjudicated according to the Valve Academic Research Consortium 3 criteria.
RESULTS: A total of 104 patients (mean age, 79.8 ± 5.83 years) were enrolled in our study. The mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons score was 4.96 ± 4.73%. Use of the LIRA method led to prosthesis downsizing in 85.6% of patients. Device success was 94.2%. All-cause death was 0%, conversion to surgery was 0%, and an extremely low rate of stroke (1.9%) and PPI (9.6%) was observed. The intended performance of the valve was attained in 96.1% of patients and it was maintained at 1-year follow-up. Clinical efficacy at 1 year was reached in 90.6% of patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The LIRA method represents an alternative option for prosthesis sizing in patients with type 1 and type 2 BAV undergoing TAVR with promising early and midterm outcomes.","['Barbara Bellini', 'Vittorio Romano', 'Greca Zanda', 'Gianmarco Iannopollo', 'Tommaso De Ferrari', 'Eva Bijlsma', 'Francesca Napoli', 'Ciro Vella', 'Domitilla Gentile', 'Giulia Ghizzoni', 'Luca Angelo Ferri', 'Filippo Russo', 'Marco Bruno Ancona', 'Francesco Ancona', 'Eustachio Agricola', 'Anna Palmisano', 'Antonio Esposito', 'Matteo Montorfano']",The Canadian journal of cardiology,2025-05-12,10.1016/j.cjca.2024.12.006,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2024.12.006,,Paid,Clinical Outcomes of Patients With Bicuspid Aortic Valve Undergoing a Targeted Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Approach The LIRA Method BELLINI 2025,Not available,"['Targeted Transcatheter Aortic', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Valve Replacement Approach', 'Bicuspid Aortic Valve', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Targeted Transcatheter', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'Aortic Valve', 'Replacement Approach', 'LIRA Method']",2025-05-12,Pending,[]
39442866,Durability of right ventricular conduits in the Ross procedure.,"BACKGROUND: Right ventricular (RV) conduit availability and degeneration are potential limitations of the Ross procedure. Pulmonary homografts are the gold standard, but their limited availability drives the need for alternatives. The aim of this study was to compare results of different RV conduits.
METHODS: Between 1995 and 2023, 315 consecutive patients (73% males; mean age, 37 ± 12 years) underwent a Ross procedure using a homograft (n = 211), bovine jugular vein (BJV) (n = 34), or xenograft (n = 70) as the RV conduit. The mean follow-up was 5.7 ± 6.7 years and was 96% complete (1631 patient-years).
RESULTS: Twelve patients (homograft, n = 8; BJV. n = 3; xenograft, n = 1) required RV conduit reintervention, including 4 patients within 4 years (all with homografts). Indications for reintervention were degeneration in 8 patients and active endocarditis in 4 patients. Reinterventions included RV conduit replacement (homograft, n = 3; xenograft, n = 1; BJV, n = 2) and transcatheter valve implantation (homograft n = 5; BJV, n = 1). At 15 years, freedom from RV conduit reintervention was 88%, and freedom from reoperation was 93%. Freedom from reintervention at 15 years was similar in the homograft (89%), BJV (89%), and xenograft (100%) groups (P = .812). Progression of mean RV conduit gradient was lowest for the BJV group (1.45 mm Hg/year) and similar in the homograft (2.6 mm Hg/year) and xenograft (2.9 mm Hg/year) groups. Age at <18 years at surgery (hazard ratio [HR], 1.9; P < .001) was a predictive risk factor for reintervention. There was no difference among the RV conduit groups (HR, 1.198; P = .606).
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of reintervention after 15 years is similar in recipients of homografts, xenografts, and BJV grafts. Interestingly, homografts may fail in the first few years, possibly related to inflammatory phenomena. Thus, the use of xenografts may be an option if homografts are not available.","['Karen B Abeln', 'Lennart Froede', 'Christian Giebels', 'Hans-Joachim Schäfers']",The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,2025-05-12,10.1016/j.jtcvs.2024.10.023,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcvs.2024.10.023,,Paid,Durability of right ventricular conduits in the Ross procedure ABELN 2025,Not available,"['Ross procedure', 'Ross', 'BJV', 'conduit', 'years', 'reintervention', 'homograft', 'homografts', 'xenograft', 'procedure']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Ross procedure', 'homograft', 'right ventricular conduit']"
39395599,"The novel balloon-expandable Myval transcatheter heart valve: systematic review of aortic, mitral, tricuspid and pulmonary indications.","INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Myval technology represents the first balloon-expandable alternative since the Edwards system became commercially available. Despite certain controversies, its use has rapidly expanded. We aimed to gather all the available literature regarding its indications and outcomes.
METHODS: A comprehensive search of articles published between December 2016 and May 2024 was conducted using BioMedCentral, Google Scholar, and PubMed to evaluate the main outcomes of Myval for native aortic stenosis (AS) (meta-analysis) and off-label uses (systematic review).
RESULTS: A total of 151 studies were identified, and 74 were included in the analysis, covering aortic (n=51), mitral (n=9), tricuspid (n=6), and pulmonary (n=8) valve positions. A meta-analysis of studies on native AS demonstrated that Myval is safe and effective, with a 30-day mortality rate of 1.3%, good hemodynamic performance, low rates of pacemaker implantation (8.8%), and ≥ moderate paravalvular regurgitation (1.3%). Compared with other contemporary devices, Myval was competitive and associated with lower rates of pacemaker implantation. In a systematic review of off-label indications, Myval was also found to be safe and effective. In bicuspid AS, pure regurgitation, and aortic valve-in-valve procedures, success rates were 100%, 92%, and 100%, respectively, with pacemaker rates of 9.9%, 22.2%, and 3%, respectively. For mitral valve-in-valve/in-ring procedures, the success rate was 96.9%, while in tricuspid and pulmonary positions, small case series reported 100% success rates for both, with minimal procedural complications.
CONCLUSIONS: Myval technology is safe and effective for the treatment of native valvular disease and dysfunctional prostheses or rings in all heart valve positions, although larger scale studies are warranted.","['Mario García-Gómez', 'Clara Fernández-Cordón', 'José Carlos González-Gutiérrez', 'Ana Serrador', 'Alberto Campo', 'Carlos Cortés Villar', 'Sara Blasco Turrión', 'Cristhian Aristizábal', 'Julio Peral Oliveira', 'Alexander Stepanenko', 'Mikel González Arribas', 'Luca Scorpiglione', 'Akash Jain', 'David Carnicero Martínez', 'J Alberto San Román', 'Ignacio J Amat-Santos']",Revista espanola de cardiologia (English ed.),2025-05-12,10.1016/j.rec.2024.09.006,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rec.2024.09.006,,Paid,The novel balloon expandable Myval transcatheter heart valve systematic review of aortic mitral tricuspid and pulmonary indications GARCÍA-GÓMEZ 2025,Not available,"['balloon-expandable Myval transcatheter', 'Myval transcatheter heart', 'Myval', 'INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES', 'Myval transcatheter', 'systematic review', 'transcatheter heart valve', 'balloon-expandable Myval', 'Myval technology', 'rates']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Aortic Regurgitation', 'Aortic stenosis', 'Estenosis aórtica', 'Insuficiencia aórtica', 'Myval', 'Myval Octacor', 'Valve-in-ring', 'Valve-in-valve', 'Valvular heart disease', 'Valvulopatías']"
39343570,Association between the Mean Platelet Volume and Prosthesis-patient Mismatch after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.,"Objective The mean platelet volume (MPV), a marker of platelet activity, is significantly higher in patients with aortic stenosis (AS) than in those without AS. The association between the platelet function and prosthesis-patient mismatch (PPM) after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) remains unknown. Therefore, we investigated this association by measuring the MPV. Methods Of 237 patients who underwent TAVR, 148 with a median age of 84 years old were enrolled in this study. Blood tests and transthoracic echocardiography were performed at baseline and approximately six months after TAVR. PPM was defined as an aortic valve area index ≤0.85 cm2/m2 after TAVR. Variable changes from baseline to six-month follow-up were compared between patients with and without PPM. Results Forty-five patients (30%) developed PPM. The MPV was significantly higher in patients with PPM than in those without PPM. However, regarding the magnitude of change, the MPV was significantly less reduced in patients with PPM, and the percentage of patients with reduced MPV was lower in patients with PPM than in those without PPM. A logistic regression analysis revealed that a higher MPV and lack of MPV reduction at the six-month follow-up were independent predictors of PPM. Conclusion MPV values at the six-month follow-up were associated with PPM after TAVR in patients with AS. MPV values increase when PPM is present after TAVR and may be an indicator during the postoperative follow-up.","['Yuichi Morita', 'Hiroki Ikenaga', 'Atsushi Takeda', 'Takayuki Nakano', 'Tasuku Higashihara', 'Noriaki Watanabe', 'Yoshiharu Sada', 'Hiroto Utsunomiya', 'Shinya Takahashi', 'Yukihiro Fukuda', 'Yukiko Nakano']","Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",2025-04-15,10.2169/internalmedicine.4205-24,https://doi.org/10.2169/internalmedicine.4205-24,,Paid,Association between the Mean Platelet Volume and Prosthesis patient Mismatch after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement MORITA 2025,Not available,"['Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'PPM', 'Platelet Volume', 'MPV', 'Aortic Valve', 'Prosthesis-patient Mismatch', 'Valve Replacement', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'TAVR']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['aortic stenosis', 'mean platelet volume', 'prosthesis-patient mismatch', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"

38936601,Five-year outcomes of transcarotid transcatheter aortic valve replacement.,"BACKGROUND: Transcarotid transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TC-TAVR) has emerged as an alternative access route for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). However, scarce data exist on long-term outcomes following TC-TAVR. This study aimed to evaluate clinical outcomes at 5 years after TC-TAVR.
METHODS: A total of 110 consecutive patients who underwent TC-TAVR were included. Baseline, procedural, and follow-up data were collected prospectively in a dedicated database. The primary endpoint was the incidence of a composite outcome of all-cause mortality, stroke, and repeat hospitalization at 5-year follow-up. Echocardiography results, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, and quality of life (QoL) as assessed with the EuroQol visual analog scale (EQ-VAS) were examined over the 5-year follow-up.
RESULTS: The median patient age was 77 years (interquartile range [IQR], 72-82.2 years), 42.3% were women, and the median Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) risk score was 5.02% (IQR, 3.4%-7.5%). The incidence of the composite primary endpoint was 54.5%. Death from any cause occurred in 45.6% of patients (11.9 per 100 patient-years); stroke in 8.2% (1.9 per 100 patient-years); disabling stroke in 2.7% (0.7 per 100 patient-years); and rehospitalization in 27.2%. The improvements in valve hemodynamics, NYHA class, and EQ-VAS following the procedure persisted at 5-year follow-up (P < .001). The incidence of bioprosthetic valve failure was 0.9%.
CONCLUSIONS: About half of the moderate-to high-risk patients undergoing TC-TAVR survived with no major cardiovascular events at the 5-year follow-up. The yearly incidence of stroke events was low, and early improvements in valve hemodynamics, functional status, and QoL persisted at 5 years. These results suggest the long-term safety and efficacy of TC-TAVR and would support this approach as an alternative to surgery in non-transfemoral candidates.","['Juan Hernando Del Portillo', 'Dimitri Kalavrouziotis', 'Eric Dumont', 'Jean-Michel Paradis', 'Anthony Poulin', 'Frederic Beaupré', 'Marisa Avvedimento', 'Silvia Mas-Peiro', 'Pedro Cepas-Guillén', 'Siddhartha Mengi', 'Siamak Mohammadi', 'Josep Rodés-Cabau']",The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,2025-05-12,10.1016/j.jtcvs.2024.06.017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcvs.2024.06.017,,Paid,Five year outcomes of transcarotid transcatheter aortic valve replacement PORTILLO 2025,Not available,"['transcarotid transcatheter aortic', 'aortic valve replacement', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'transcatheter aortic', 'transcarotid transcatheter', 'valve replacement', 'aortic valve', 'replacement', 'aortic', 'transcatheter']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['aortic valve', 'long-term', 'transcarotid', 'transcatheter valve replacement']"
38815806,Machine-learning approaches for risk prediction in transcatheter aortic valve implantation: Systematic review and meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVES: With the expanding integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) into the structural heart domain, numerous ML models have emerged for the prediction of adverse outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). We aim to identify, describe, and critically appraise ML prediction models for adverse outcomes after TAVI. Key objectives consisted in summarizing model performance, evaluating adherence to reporting guidelines, and transparency.
METHODS: We searched PubMed, SCOPUS, and Embase through August 2023. We selected published machine learning models predicting TAVI outcomes. Two reviewers independently screened articles, extracted data, and assessed the study quality according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Outcomes included summary C-statistics and model risk of bias assessed with the Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. C-statistics were pooled using a random-effects model.
RESULTS: Twenty-one studies (118,153 patients) employing various ML algorithms (76 models) were included in the systematic review. Predictive ability of models varied: 11.8% inadequate (C-statistic <0.60), 26.3% adequate (C-statistic 0.60-0.70), 31.6% acceptable (C-statistic 0.70-0.80), and 30.3% demonstrated excellent (C-statistic >0.80) performance. Meta-analyses revealed excellent predictive performance for early mortality (C-statistic: 0.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65-0.91), acceptable performance for 1-year mortality (C-statistic: 0.76; 95% CI, 0.67-0.84), and acceptable performance for predicting permanent pacemaker implantation (C-statistic: 0.75; 95% CI, 0.51-0.90).
CONCLUSIONS: ML models for TAVI outcomes exhibit adequate-to-excellent performance, suggesting potential clinical utility.

40351452,Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair for post-surgical recurrent mitral regurgitation in hereditary spherocytosis: a case report.,"BACKGROUND: Management of mitral regurgitation (MR) in patients with hereditary spherocytosis (HS) poses unique challenges due to increased haemolysis risk. While surgical mitral valve repair is the standard treatment, the optimal strategy for recurrent MR after initial repair remains unclear, particularly regarding the safety and durability of transcatheter interventions in this high-risk population.
CASE SUMMARY: A 57-year-old woman with HS developed severe recurrent MR 4 years after initial surgical repair that intentionally omitted annuloplasty to minimize haemolysis risk. Given the risks of redo surgery and mechanical valve replacement, mitral valve transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (M-TEER) was performed. The procedure achieved successful MR reduction without causing haemolysis. At the 5-year follow-up, the patient maintained improved functional status with stable moderate MR and no evidence of haemolysis, despite her underlying condition.
DISCUSSION: This case demonstrates successful long-term outcomes of M-TEER for post-surgical recurrent MR in a patient with HS. The strategic approach-initial ring-less surgical repair followed by M-TEER-suggests a viable treatment pathway for patients with inherited haemolytic disorders, particularly when minimizing prosthetic material exposure is crucial.","['Hiroto Yagasaki', 'Yukio Umeda', 'Takeki Suzuki', 'Ryota Watanabe', 'Toshiyuki Noda']",European heart journal.

40349944,Explantation of Transcatheter Aortic Bioprostheses in a Very High-Risk Population.,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement explantation is associated with excessive rates of mortality. We describe a high-risk cohort of patients who underwent surgical explant with excellent outcomes at our institution.
METHODS: This is a single center, retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent surgical removal of a transcatheter bioprosthesis between January 2015 and April 2023. Clinical and operative characteristics were reviewed by direct chart review and survival was estimated.
RESULTS: Thirty-three patients underwent device explantation. Mean age was 75 ± 5.9 years. STS-PROM was 7.34 at surgical explant. Eighteen patients (55%) had previous cardiac surgery, with 15 secondary and 3 tertiary sternotomoies. Fourteen patients had prior ViV TAVR. Indications for explantation were prosthetic valve degeneration (46%), endocarditis (33%), paravalvular leak (15%), and ventricular septal defect (6%). Median TAVR valve age was 815 days. Twenty-two patients required a concomitant operation including: mitral valve replacement (21%), aortic operation (9%), coronary bypass grafting (18%), myectomy (6%), and atrial or ventricular septal defect repair (12%). None required aortic root replacement. Mean hospital length of stay was 10 ± 8 days. Postoperative complications included new renal failure (6%), respiratory failure (12%), pacemaker implantation (3%), and reentry for bleeding (3%). No patient suffered a stroke.

This study aimed to identify risk factors and develop predictive models for post-operative MR following TAVR using machine learning (ML) techniques to enhance early detection and intervention.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from patients who underwent TAVR at our center between August 2014 and August 2023. Patients were classified into post-operative and nonpost-operative MR groups based on postprocedural MR severity. Various ML models were evaluated for predictive performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) values were used to interpret predictive patterns and develop a clinically relevant model.
RESULTS: Among the evaluated models, the random forest model exhibited the highest predictive performance for post-operative moderate-to-severe MR after TAVR. Key predictors, which were confirmed by the SHAP analysis as important in the predictive framework, included echocardiographic parameters, blood test results, patient age, and body mass index.
CONCLUSIONS: ML models show promise in predicting post-operative moderate-to-severe MR after TAVR by integrating clinical indicators to enhance predictive accuracy.

40348408,Defining centres of expertise for minimally invasive mitral valve surgery: a systematic review and volume-outcome meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive mitral valve surgery (MIMVS) is increasingly performed, but outcomes such as repair rate, mortality and survival likely depend on expertise. Still, the definition of a high-volume centre varies in the literature and lacks an evidence-based substantiation. Consequently, this study aims to determine the volume-outcome relation in MIMVS in conjunction with a volume threshold, in order to define 'high-volume centres', applying a novel statistical concept.
METHODS: The study was preregistered in PROSPERO (CRD42022376293, registered 26 November 2022). A systematic search was applied to three databases, including consecutive patients undergoing MIMVS. Studies describing patients undergoing transcatheter procedures were excluded. Restricted cubic spline analyses were applied and the elbow method was used to retrieve the threshold volume. Long-term outcomes were analysed using reconstructed Kaplan-Meier curves and a novel statistical concept to assess the volume-outcome relation for time-to-event outcomes was applied. The primary outcome was early mortality, secondary outcomes were repair rate, stroke, and long-term survival, freedom from reoperation, and freedom from more than moderate mitral regurgitation. Leave-one-out analyses were performed for sensitivity purposes.
RESULTS: Data from 68 unique centres were included (n=23 495 patients). Early mortality was 1.3% (95% CI 1.1% to 1.6%), without a statistically significant non-linear relation for this endpoint, nor for stroke. There was a statistically significant volume-outcome relation for mitral valve repair rate (p=0.018). Based on the repair rate, the threshold to define a high-volume centre was 60 cases/year (number needed to treat to prevent a replacement ≤7). A significant volume-outcome relation was observed for long-term outcomes as well, with a threshold of 53 and 54 cases/year for long-term survival and freedom from reoperation, respectively. These results were robust across the sensitivity analyses for the various endpoints.
CONCLUSIONS: The threshold to define a high-volume centre ranges between 53 and 60 cases/year based on repair rate, long-term survival and freedom-from reoperation. These findings have the potential to facilitate centralisation of MIMVS.PROSPERO registration numberCRD42022376293.","['Samuel Heuts', 'Warda Hjij', 'Michal J Kawczynski', 'Jules R Olsthoorn', 'Andrew Tjon Joek Tjien', 'Sander M J van Kuijk', 'Jos G Maessen', 'Peyman Sardari Nia']",Heart (British Cardiac Society),2025-05-10,10.1136/heartjnl-2024-325048,https://doi.org/10.1136/heartjnl-2024-325048,,Paid,Defining centres of expertise for minimally invasive mitral valve surgery a systematic review and volume outcome meta analysis HEUTS 2025,Not available,"['minimally invasive mitral', 'mitral valve surgery', 'invasive mitral valve', 'minimally invasive', 'valve surgery', 'repair rate', 'mitral valve', 'volume-outcome relation', 'invasive mitral', 'rate']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Cardiac Surgical Procedures', 'General Surgery', 'Mitral Valve Insufficiency']"
40345648,Balloon-Expandable versus Self-Expanding Valves in Patients With Prior Surgical Mitral Valve Replacement Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.,"BACKGROUND: Preexisting mitral prosthesis raises technical challenges for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) but has been scarcely studied. This study sought to compare outcomes of patients with previous surgical mitral valve prostheses undergoing TAVR with balloon-expandable (BEV) or self-expanding valve (SEV) systems.
METHODS: Patients from the Spanish TAVR registry with preexisting surgical mitral prostheses were included. The primary endpoints were Valve Academic Research Consortium-3 technical and device success and were analyzed according to valve type. The rates of transcatheter heart valve (THV) embolization, mitral valve impingement, THV performance and pacemaker were also assessed.
RESULTS: A total of 243 patients were included (BEV: 37%; SEV: 63%). Overall technical success was 95.9%. 30-day device success was higher in BEV patients (94.4% vs 85.0%, p=0.036), mainly driven by lower incidences of moderate residual aortic regurgitation (0% vs 5.9%, p=0.028) and THV embolization (0% vs 3.9%, p=0.087). BEV recipients exhibited higher mean transvalvular gradients (10.5 vs 8.1 mmHg, p=0.002) and lower rates of permanent pacemaker implantation (5.6% vs 15.7%, p=0.023). There were no differences in mortality, bleeding or readmission at 30 days. In multivariate analysis, a mitroaortic distance ≤7 mm and lack of transesophageal echocardiography guidance were associated with increased device failure.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with preexisting MV prostheses, TAVR was safe and effective regardless of the THV type. Nevertheless, the use of BEVs resulted in a greater rate of device success driven by lesser THV embolization and residual aortic regurgitation.","['Lluis Asmarats', 'Pilar Jiménez-Quevedo', 'Ignacio J Amat-Santos', 'María-Cruz Ferrer-Gracia', 'Fernando Sarnago', 'Juan H Alonso-Briales', 'Juan Francisco Oteo', 'Vicenç Serra', 'Guillem Muntané-Carol', 'Victoria Vilalta', 'David Del Val', 'Manuel Pan', 'José M De la Torre Hernández', 'Sergio García-Blas', 'José Luis Díez', 'Alberto Berenguer', 'Raquel Del Valle', 'Felipe Navarro Del Amo', 'Miguel Artaiz', 'Ander Regueiro', 'Manuel López-Pérez', 'Albert Massó van-Roessel', 'José G Paredes-Vázquez', 'Clara Fernández-Cordón', 'José Antonio Diarte de Miguel', 'Nicolás Maneiro', 'Alberto Piserra-López', 'Jorge de la Fuente', 'Juan Muñoz', 'Rafael Romaguera', 'Xavier Carrillo', 'Fernando Alfonso', 'Marco Alvarado', 'Gabriela Veiga', 'Xavier Millán', 'Luis Nombela-Franco', 'Dabit Arzamendi']",The Canadian journal of cardiology,2025-05-07,10.1016/j.cjca.2025.04.026,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2025.04.026,,Paid,Balloon Expandable versus Self Expanding Valves in Patients With Prior Surgical Mitral Valve Replacement Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement ASMARATS 2025,Not available,"['Prior Surgical Mitral', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Replacement Undergoing Transcatheter', 'Valve Replacement Undergoing', 'Valve Replacement', 'Mitral Valve Replacement', 'Surgical Mitral Valve', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Prior Surgical', 'Valve']",2025-05-12,Pending,[]
40340705,Evaluating the AltaValve as a novel method for transcatheter mitral valve replacement.,"Mitral regurgitation (MR) is the most common heart valve disease, and severe MR is associated with a poor prognosis if left untreated. Although surgical repair or replacement constitutes the standard therapy when indicated, many high-risk patients are considered ineligible for surgery. Transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR) offers a less invasive alternative to conventional surgery and may also overcome some of the limitations of percutaneous repair techniques. Currently, multiple TMVR devices are undergoing clinical evaluation, showing promising results. However, challenges mainly related to the complex mitral valve anatomy along with the interaction with the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) have resulted in high screen failure rates among TMVR candidates. The AltaValve System features a supra-annular design, ensuring secure fixation in the left atrium above the native mitral valve annulus without anchoring mechanisms that could interfere with the left ventricle (LV). These distinctive attributes aim to address the existing TMVR limitations across a broad patient population and help to avoid complications such as LVOT obstruction, LV damage, and/or prosthesis embolization. Initial safety and feasibility data are encouraging, but a larger cohort of patients with longer follow-up will be essential to confirm the safety and efficacy of the AltaValve system.","['Pablo Vidal-Calés', 'Pedro L Cepas-Guillén', 'Juan H Del Portillo', 'Josep Rodés-Cabau']",Future cardiology,2025-05-09,10.1080/14796678.2025.2499352,https://doi.org/10.1080/14796678.2025.2499352,,Paid,Evaluating the AltaValve as a novel method for transcatheter mitral valve replacement VIDAL-CALÉS 2025,Not available,"['mitral valve replacement', 'transcatheter mitral valve', 'mitral valve', 'valve replacement', 'transcatheter mitral', 'mitral', 'valve', 'TMVR', 'Evaluating the AltaValve', 'heart valve disease']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Mitral regurgitation', 'altavalve', 'mitral insufficiency', 'mitral valve', 'transcatheter mitral valve replacement']"
40336935,When the heart becomes suicidal: a case report of severe left ventricular outflow tract obstruction following transcatheter aortic valve implantation.,"BACKGROUND: Replacement of the aortic valve is a Class I recommendation for treatment of patients suffering from severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis. However, aortic valve replacement can occasionally lead to complications, including development of acute left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction. This rare but severe complication is referred to as the so-called 'suicide left ventricle' phenomenon.
CASE SUMMARY: This case report presents an 88-year-old woman who developed severe LVOT obstruction following a successful transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), complicated by septal anterior motion of the mitral valve resulting in severe mitral regurgitation. Despite initial intensive care management, her symptoms persisted, necessitating the application of transcoronary ablation of septal hypertrophy as a bail-out procedure. Transcoronary ablation of septal hypertrophy, typically used in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, successfully reduced the LVOT gradient and relieved symptoms.
DISCUSSION: This case emphasizes the importance of pre-operative identification of LVOT obstruction risk factors, awareness for this complication and a well-experience multidisciplinary team for the management of TAVI-associated complications.","['Carl Schulz', 'Fabian J Brunner', 'Simon Pecha', 'Nils Sörensen', 'Niklas Schofer']",European heart journal.

40329826,Phenotypic Clustering Analysis of Patients Rejected for Mitral Valve Interventions: Implications for Future Transcatheter Technologies.,"AIMS: Although several treatment options are available for patients with severe mitral regurgitation (MR), a significant proportion of patients remain ineligible for any mitral valve (MV) intervention. We aimed to analyze the phenotypic characteristics of surgical high-risk patients ineligible for MV interventions using an unsupervised phenotypic clustering approach.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Between 2014 and 2022, the CHOICE-MI registry included 984 patients with MR undergoing screening for transcatheter mitral valve replacement at 33 international sites. For this study, only patients with screening failure receiving medical therapy alone were included. Patients receiving transcatheter or surgical treatment were excluded. A cluster analysis using K-means was performed on baseline clinical, demographic, and imaging variables to identify different patient phenotypes. Among 284 patients with MR (77.4±8.82 years, 56.0% female, EuroSCORE II: 6.6±5.8%) considered ineligible for any MV intervention, two clinically distinct phenogroups (PG) were identified using unsupervised hierarchical clustering of principal components. PG1: elderly women with primary MR, preserved left ventricular function, and annular calcification; and PG2: patients with secondary MR, advanced heart failure, and high prevalence of comorbidities. One-year all-cause mortality did not differ between the phenogroups (PG1: 21.4%, PG2: 23.4%, p=0.89). Predictors of mortality were albumin, renal function, extracardiac arteriopathy for PG1, and albumin, coronary artery disease, and prior myocardial infarction for PG2.
CONCLUSIONS: This study identified two major subgroups among patients ineligible for mitral interventions showing profound differences in clinical and anatomical profiles. Identifying these factors may drive technological evolution to address the unmet clinical need for therapeutic options in MR patients.

40324748,The American Association for Thoracic Surgery (AATS) 2025 Expert Consensus Document: Surgical management of mitral annular calcification.,"OBJECTIVE: Surgery for mitral valve disease in patients with mitral annular calcification (MAC) remains challenging. There is no consensus on the ideal management strategy or patient selection, and perioperative and periprocedural morbidity and mortality rates remain high. The recent surge of patients presenting with MAC has been accompanied by increased interest in MAC surgery and interventions. This expert consensus document is meant to provide a simplified outline for managing MAC, including patient selection, imaging, and surgical and transcatheter therapeutic options, with a particular focus on conventional surgical techniques and hybrid approaches.
METHODS: The American Association for Thoracic Surgery Clinical Practice Standards Committee assembled an international panel of cardiac surgeons and structural heart interventionalists with established expertise in the field of MAC. A comprehensive literature review was performed by the panel and a medical librarian. Clinical recommendations were developed utilizing a modified Delphi method.
RESULTS: Expert consensus was reached on 33 recommendations, with class of recommendation and level of evidence, for each of 5 main topics: (1) preoperative evaluation for patients with MAC, patient selection, and indications for intervention; (2) standard surgical techniques in MAC; (3) hybrid procedures in MAC; (4) transcatheter MAC interventions; and (5) complications and bailout of MAC surgery and interventions.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the complexity and heterogenicity of patients presenting with MAC, consensus on several key recommendations was reached by this American Association for Thoracic Surgery expert panel. These recommendations provide guidance for cardiac surgeons and structural heart interventionists in treating most patients who present with MAC.","['Ahmed E El-Eshmawi', 'Monika Halas', 'Brian T Bethea', 'Tirone E David', 'Eugene A Grossi', 'Mayra Guerrero', 'Samir Kapadia', 'Serguei Melnitchouk', 'Stephanie L Mick', 'Eduard Quintana', 'Matthew A Romano', 'Gilbert H L Tang', 'Shinya Unai', 'Ravi K Ghanta']",The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,2025-05-03,10.1016/j.jtcvs.2025.04.003,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcvs.2025.04.003,,Paid,The American Association for Thoracic Surgery AATS 2025 Expert Consensus Document Surgical management of mitral annular calcification EL-ESHMAWI 2025,Not available,"['mitral annular calcification', 'MAC', 'Thoracic Surgery', 'Association for Thoracic', 'American Association', 'Expert Consensus Document', 'MAC surgery', 'Thoracic Surgery expert', 'Thoracic Surgery Clinical', 'annular calcification']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['mitral annular calcification', 'mitral valve repair', 'mitral valve replacement']"

40270122,The Impact of Concomitant Mitral Regurgitation on Echocardiography Parameters After TransCatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Mitral regurgitation (MR) commonly coexists with aortic stenosis (AS) and is a potential risk factor influencing outcomes following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the mean changes in key echocardiographic parameters before and after TAVR and to compare these changes between patients with moderate-to-severe MR (MR ≥ 2) and those with none-to-mild MR (MR < 2).
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted using six electronic databases. We included studies that evaluated patients undergoing TAVR, classified them based on baseline MR grade ≥ 2 (moderate/severe MR) or MR grade < 2 (none/mild MR), and reported the mean difference (MD) in echocardiographic parameters before and after TAVR in both groups. The primary outcomes included changes in ejection fraction (EF), LV end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) index, LV end-systolic volume (LVESV) index, LV end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), LV end-systolic diameter (LVESD), aortic valve area (AVA), and the mean aortic gradient. Pooled MDs were analyzed using a random-effects model.
RESULTS: Thirteen studies with 7163 patients were included, of which 2376 had an MR ≥ 2. The MR < 2 and MR ≥ 2 groups experienced significant improvements in AVA and reductions in mean aortic gradient, LVEDV index, LVESV index, LVEDD, and LVESD. Compared to MR < 2 patients, those with MR ≥ 2 exhibited significantly greater improvements in EF (MD = 2.03; 95% CI: 0.81, 3.24), LVEDV index (MD = -5.55; 95% CI: -7.85, -3.26), LVESV index (MD = -5.43; 95% CI: -7.28, -3.58), LVESD (MD = -2.23; 95% CI: -3.71, -0.26), and mean aortic gradient (MD = 1.43; 95% CI: 0.79, 2.07). However, the changes in LVEDD and AVA were not significantly different between the groups.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that patients with moderate-to-severe baseline MR before TAVR showed greater pronounced improvements in specific echocardiographic parameters related to LV function and geometry, particularly in LVEF, LVEDV index, LVESV index, and LVESD, compared to those with none-to-mild MR. Future studies should focus on stratifying outcomes according to MR etiology and using advanced imaging techniques to delineate better the mechanisms underlying these improvements.","['Bahar Darouei', 'Reza Amani-Beni', 'Mehrdad Rabiee Rad', 'Ghazal Ghasempour Dabaghi', 'Reza Eshraghi', 'Ashkan Bahrami', 'Ehsan Amini-Salehi', 'Seyyed Mohammad Hashemi', 'Sadegh Mazaheri-Tehrani', 'Mohammad Reza Movahed']",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,2025-04-24,10.1002/ccd.31555,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.31555,,Paid,The Impact of Concomitant Mitral Regurgitation on Echocardiography Parameters After TransCatheter Aortic Valve Replacement A Systematic Review and Meta Analysis DAROUEI 2025,Not available,"['Concomitant Mitral Regurgitation', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Impact of Concomitant', 'Systematic Review', 'Concomitant Mitral', 'TransCatheter Aortic Valve', 'Mitral Regurgitation', 'Valve Replacement', 'Aortic Valve', 'Echocardiography Parameters']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['aortic valve stenosis', 'echocardiography', 'meta‐analysis', 'mitral valve insufficiency', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"
40262017,Perioperative Outcomes in Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement with Concomitant Mitral Regurgitation: A Meta-Analysis.,"Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is widely performed in high-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis. However, the effects of baseline concomitant mitral regurgitation (MR) on perioperative outcomes remain unclear. This study evaluated the impact of concomitant MR severity on short-term TAVR outcomes. A systematic search of 6 electronic databases was conducted. Studies that stratified patients based on MR severity (MR ≥2 vs. <2 or MR ≥3 vs. <3) and reported perioperative outcomes, including short-term mortality, in-hospital mortality, acute kidney injury (AKI), pacemaker implantation, bleeding, vascular complications, and MR improvement (up to 1 week and 1 month) were eligible. Data from 26 studies (32,453 patients) demonstrated that patients with baseline moderate-to-severe MR (MR ≥2) had a 49% (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.32-1.70) increased risk of short-term mortality, a 41% (95% CI, 1.22-1.63) higher risk of in-hospital mortality, and a 38% (95% CI, 1.17-1.62) higher risk of AKI than those with none-to-mild MR (MR<2). Patients with an MR ≥3 had an even greater 72% (95% CI, 1.37-2.16) increase in short-term mortality. No significant differences were observed in pacemaker implantation, bleeding, or vascular complications between groups. Additionally, after TAVR, MR improved in 36% of patients by at least 1 grade within 1 week, increasing to 44% by 1 month. In TAVR patients, MR ≥2 was associated with significantly higher early mortality and AKI risk, underscoring the need for a comprehensive perioperative risk assessment. Future studies should examine the differential impact of functional and degenerative MR.","['Reza Amani-Beni', 'Bahar Darouei', 'Mehrdad Rabiee Rad', 'Ghazal Ghasempour Dabaghi', 'Reza Eshraghi', 'Ashkan Bahrami', 'Ehsan Amini-Salehi', 'Seyyed Mohammad Hashemi', 'Sadegh Mazaheri-Tehrani', 'Mohammad Reza Movahed']",Cardiology in review,2025-04-22,10.1097/CRD.0000000000000919,https://doi.org/10.1097/CRD.0000000000000919,,Paid,Perioperative Outcomes in Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement with Concomitant Mitral Regurgitation A Meta Analysis AMANI-BENI 2025,Not available,"['Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Patients Undergoing Transcatheter', 'Concomitant Mitral Regurgitation', 'Undergoing Transcatheter', 'Aortic Valve', 'Valve Replacement', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'Mitral Regurgitation']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['aortic valve stenosis', 'mitral valve insufficiency', 'mortality', 'perioperative care', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"

40257595,Characteristics of cardiac rehabilitation progress during hospitalization and in-hospital outcomes after mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair.,"Mitral regurgitation is a prevalent cardiac valvular disease, and its incidence is increasing with the aging population. While surgical intervention has traditionally been the standard treatment for this disease, in Japan, mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (M-TEER) has emerged as a less invasive alternative since 2018. M-TEER demonstrates promising outcomes in reducing postoperative complications and shortening hospital stays. However, scarce data on cardiac rehabilitation (CR) following M-TEER is available. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the characteristics of CR progress during hospitalization and in-hospital outcomes following M-TEER. This single-center, retrospective cohort study involved 244 patients who underwent M-TEER at the Sakakibara Heart Institute between April 2018 and March 2023. Data on progress in CR and in-hospital outcomes, including hospitalization-associated disability (HAD), rate of return to home, and hospitalization that extended beyond 30 days after M-TEER, were collected. After excluding patients who met the exclusion criteria-including conversion to surgical mitral valve replacement or the absence of CR during hospitalization-233 patients were included in the analysis. The patients' median age was 81 years, with 48.5% being female. In 43% of cases, the hospitalizations were unplanned. Ambulation was initiated at a median of 1 day after M-TEER, with 88.4% of patients being able to commence ambulation as early as 2 days after M-TEER. However, only 19.3% engaged in aerobic exercise using equipment in the CR room. The median length of stay following M-TEER was 6 days, with 4.7% of hospitalizations resulting in a stay of 30 days or more. Ultimately, 90.6% of patients were discharged home, with an incidence of HAD of 9.9%. Compared to the planned hospitalization group, the unplanned hospitalization group had a significantly lower rate of early postoperative ambulation (planned hospitalization group: 97.7% vs. unplanned hospitalization group: 76.2%, p < 0.01), a higher proportion of patients with hospital stays exceeding 30 days (0% vs. 10.9%, p < 0.01), a lower rate of home discharge (98.5% vs. 80.2%, p < 0.01), and an increased incidence of HAD (0.8% vs. 22.2%, p < 0.01). M-TEER provides a minimally invasive treatment option for mitral regurgitation with favorable early rehabilitation and in-hospital outcomes, particularly in planned hospitalization.

40240085,Surgical Mitral Valve Repair vs Replacement After Failed Mitral Transcatheter Edge-to-Edge Repair: The CUTTING-EDGE Registry.,"BACKGROUND: The impact of mitral valve (MV) surgery type after failed mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (M-TEER) has not been well studied.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of MV repair vs replacement after failed M-TEER.
METHODS: From 2009 to 2020, a total of 332 patients across 34 centers from the CUTTING-EDGE registry underwent MV surgery after M-TEER. Outcomes were compared between MV repair and replacement. Primary outcomes included 30-day mortality and 1-year survival after MV surgery.
RESULTS: Among enrolled patients (mean age 73.8 ± 10.1 years, median Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality 3.9% [Q1-Q3: 2.2%-6.8%]), 25 (7.5%) underwent repair and 307 (92.5%) underwent replacement. The replacement group had a significantly higher rate of comorbidities, including atrial fibrillation, prior cardiac surgery, more secondary mitral regurgitation, and more devices implanted at index M-TEER (P < 0.05 for all). Replacement patients showed a trend toward higher 30-day mortality (17.7% [52 of 294] vs 4.0% [1 of 25]; P = 0.094). The observed-to-expected ratio of 30-day mortality was 3.6 (95% CI: 1.9-5.3) overall, 3.8 (95% CI: 2.1-5.5) in the replacement group, and 1.7 (95% CI: 0.7-3.3) in the repair group. Replacement patients had higher 1-year mortality (33.3% [65 of 195] vs 10.5% [2 of 19]; P = 0.041). Significantly lower survival rates were observed after replacement at 2 years (P = 0.033) and persisted in the risk-adjusted Cox regression analysis (HR for replacement: 4.24; 95% CI: 1.04-17.31; P = 0.044).
CONCLUSIONS: MV surgery after failed M-TEER is a high-risk procedure associated with higher than expected 30-day mortality, with higher mortality associated with MV replacement. Compared with repair, replacement is associated with higher 1-year mortality and a lower 2-year survival.","['Mateo Marin-Cuartas', 'Jagdip Kang', 'Thilo Noack', 'Manuela de la Cuesta', 'Markus Krane', 'Volkmar Falk', 'Lenard Conradi', 'Christian Hagl', 'Maurizio Taramasso', 'Tom C Nguyen', 'D Scott Lim', 'Gorav Ailawadi', 'Michael J Mack', 'Robert L Smith', 'Anita W Asgar', 'Kendra J Grubb', 'Luigi Pirelli', 'Paolo Denti', 'Thomas Modine', 'Michael J Reardon', 'Tamim M Nazif', 'Vinayak N Bapat', 'Tsuyoshi Kaneko', 'Philipp Kiefer', 'Michael A Borger', 'Gilbert H L Tang', 'Syed Zaid']",JACC.

39947459,Mitral Valve Surgery After Failed Transcatheter Edge-to-Edge Repair: A Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) is increasingly used for mitral regurgitation (MR), particularly in high-risk patients. However, when TEER fails, patients often require mitral valve surgery, which remains challenging because of patients' compromised condition. This study aims to evaluate short- and long-term surgical outcomes following failed TEER.
METHODS: This meta-analysis included observational studies with reported outcomes of mitral valve surgery after failed TEER published until September 2024. Multivariable meta-regressions were performed to predict short- and long-term mortality. Kaplan-Meier function was reconstructed from individual studies.
RESULTS: Sixteen studies were included with a total sample of 892 patients. The mean age was 74.8 years (55% males), with most patients (87.8%) in New York Heart Association class III or IV before surgery. Pooled mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) predicted risk of mortality score before index TEER was 6.3%. Surgical indications were recurrent MR ≥3+ (93%), mitral stenosis (17%), and endocarditis (2.7%). The average time between TEER and surgery was 6.4 months. Mitral valve replacement was performed in 83.8% of cases. Thirty-day all-cause mortality was 12.2% but significantly lower for elective cases (2.5%). At a mean follow-up of 14.7 months, mortality was 28.3%. Preoperative incidence of coronary artery disease, lower left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF), rate of concomitant procedures, and functional mitral regurgitation were predictors of short- and long-term outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Mitral valve surgery after failed TEER presents significant challenges, yet acceptable outcomes are achievable, particularly in elective cases. Complete treatment of concomitant lesions may improve outcomes in patients with preserved LVEF. Future research should stratify outcomes based on emergent vs elective surgery and MR etiology to guide tailored surgical strategies.","['Francesco Cabrucci', 'Massimo Baudo', 'Dimitrios E Magouliotis', 'Yoshiyuki Yamashita', 'Stephanie Kjelstrom', 'Beatrice Bacchi', 'Massimo Bonacchi', 'Aleksander Dokollari', 'Serge Sicouri', 'Basel Ramlawi']",The Canadian journal of cardiology,2025-05-12,10.1016/j.cjca.2025.02.010,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2025.02.010,,Paid,Mitral Valve Surgery After Failed Transcatheter Edge to Edge Repair A Meta Analysis CABRUCCI 2025,Not available,"['Mitral Valve Surgery', 'Mitral Valve', 'failed TEER', 'Valve Surgery', 'TEER', 'Failed Transcatheter', 'Mitral', 'Valve', 'Surgery', 'Transcatheter']",2025-05-12,Pending,[]
39904549,Valve thrombosis and antithrombotic therapy after bioprosthetic mitral valve replacement: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"AIMS: Transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR) has become a feasible alternative to surgical mitral valve replacement (SMVR) in selected patients at high surgical risk. The risk of valve thrombosis following SMVR and TMVR, and the optimal antithrombotic therapy following these procedures, remains uncertain. We aimed to compare the incidence of bioprosthetic mitral valve thrombosis (bMVT) after SMVR and TMVR, and the incidence of bMVT between patients on different antithrombotic regimens.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A literature search of Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library was performed between January 2000 and August 2024. Random-effects models were used to derive pooled estimates of the incidence of bMVT in the absence of prior or active endocarditis and valve thrombosis. A total of 47 studies (6170 patients, total follow-up 9541.8 patient-years) were eligible for inclusion. The overall incidence of bMVT was 5.05 [95% confidence interval (CI) 3.18-8.01, I2 = 82%] per 100-patient-years. Subclinical bMVT was more common than clinically significant bMVT: incidence 19.11 vs. 7.91 per 100-patient-years, adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) 4.62 (95% CI 1.39-15.36), P = 0.012. bMVT was numerically more common after TMVR than SMVR, but the comparison was not statistically significant: incidence 7.03 vs. 0.58 per 100-patient-years, aIRR 2.19 (95% CI 0.72-6.72), P = 0.170. Patients on vitamin-K antagonists (VKA) had a lower incidence of bMVT than patients on direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC; incidence 5.72 vs. 17.08, aIRR 0.31, 95% CI 0.13-0.73, P = 0.007).
CONCLUSIONS: bMVT is not uncommon, with numerically higher incidence in transcatheter compared to surgical valves, but the comparison was not statistically significant. VKAs are associated with a lower incidence of bMVT compared to DOACs.","['Mark J Zorman', 'Jonathan Vibhishanan', 'Katerina Dangas', 'James Castle', 'Ka Hou Christien Li', 'Marco Coronelli', 'Kate Eastwick-Jones', 'Alexander Swan', 'Nicky Johnson', 'Anurag Choksey', 'Helen Yan', 'Sam G C Scott', 'Matthew Henry', 'Mark Philip Cassar', 'Cara Barnes', 'Joao Ferreira-Martins', 'James Newton', 'Sam Dawkins', 'Mohamad Alkhouli', 'Charanjit Rihal', 'Mackram F Eleid', 'Sorin V Pislaru', 'Mayra E Guerrero', 'Jose Ordonez-Mena', 'Thomas J Cahill']",European heart journal.

39903642,The reversibility of cardiac damage after transcatheter aortic valve implantation and short-term outcomes in a real-world setting.,"AIMS: This study aims to assess the changes in cardiac damage stage in a real-world cohort of patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), and to investigate the prognostic value of cardiac damage stage evolution.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing TAVI were retrospectively analysed. A five-stage system based on the presence and extent of cardiac damage assessed by echocardiography was applied before and 6 months after TAVI. Multivariable Cox regression analyses were used to examine independent prognostic value of the changes in cardiac damage after TAVI. A total of 734 patients with severe AS (mean age, 79.8 ± 7.4 years; 55% male) were included. Before TAVI, 32 (4%) patients did not show any sign of extra-valvular cardiac damage (Stage 0), 85 (12%) had left ventricular damage (Stage 1), 220 (30%) left atrial and/or mitral valve damage (Stage 2), 227 (31%) pulmonary vasculature and/or tricuspid valve damage (Stage 3), and 170 (23%) right ventricular damage (Stage 4). Six months after TAVI, 39% of the patients improved at least one stage in cardiac damage. Staging of cardiac damage at 6 months after TAVI [hazard ratio (HR) per one-stage increase, 1.391; P = 0.035] as well as worsening in the stage of cardiac damage (HR, 3.729; P = 0.005) were independently associated with 2-year all-cause mortality.
CONCLUSION: More than one-third of patients with severe AS showed an improvement in cardiac damage 6 months after TAVI. Staging cardiac damage at baseline and follow-up may improve risk stratification in patients undergoing TAVI.","['Rinchyenkhand Myagmardorj', 'Federico Fortuni', 'Philippe Généreux', 'Takeru Nabeta', 'Jan Stassen', 'Xavier Galloo', 'Maria Chiara Meucci', 'Steele Butcher', 'Frank van der Kley', 'David J Cohen', 'Marie-Annick Clavel', 'Philippe Pibarot', 'Martin B Leon', 'Madelien V Regeer', 'Victoria Delgado', 'Nina Ajmone Marsan', 'Jeroen J Bax']",European heart journal.

39855450,Outcomes and Predictors of Different Flow-Gradient Patterns of Aortic Stenosis After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.,"This study sought to explore the clinical factors associated with classical low-flow low-gradient (C-LFLG) and normal-flow low-gradient (NFLG) aortic stenosis (AS) compared with high-gradient (HG) AS. We also compared clinical and echocardiographic outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) across flow-gradient patterns. Patients with C-LFLG AS have a higher mortality rate after TAVR than those with HG AS. However, what leads to C-LFLG AS and the predictors of mortality in this population remain unclear. In this retrospective, single-center study involving 1,415 patients with severe AS, patients were classified as having (1) HG AS (aortic valve mean gradient [MG] >40 mm Hg), (2) C-LFLG AS (MG <40 mm Hg, stroke volume index <35 ml/m2, left ventricular ejection fraction <50%), and (3) NFLG AS (MG <40 mm Hg, stroke volume index ≥35 ml/m2, left ventricular ejection fraction ≥50%). Logistic regression was used for predictors of C-LFLG AS. Cox regression was used for predictors of mortality in the C-LFLG AS population. Male gender, multiple co-morbidities, and moderate to severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation correlated with the C-LFLG AS group. Patients with C-LFLG AS had a higher mortality risk compared with patients with HG AS at 2 years after TAVR. Patients with NFLG AS had similar mortality at 1 year, but higher mortality at 2 years after TAVR compared with patients with HG AS. End-stage renal disease, atrial fibrillation, and other co-morbidities were predictors of 2-year mortality in patients with C-LFLG AS. In conclusion, the mortality rate after TAVR was higher among patients with C-LFLG AS than those with HG AS. Male gender and multiple co-morbidities were predictors of C-LFLG AS.

39147118,Ten-Year Follow-Up of Mitral Valve Replacement With the Epic Porcine Valve in a Medicare Population.,"BACKGROUND: Bioprosthetic surgical mitral valve replacement (SMVR) remains an important treatment option in the era of transcatheter valve interventions. This study presents 10-year clinical outcomes of Medicare beneficiaries who underwent SMVR with a contemporary low-profile mitral porcine valve.
METHODS: This was a single-arm observational study using Medicare fee-for-service claims data. Deidentified patients undergoing SMVR with the Epic mitral valve (Abbott) in the United States between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2019 were selected by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth Revision procedure codes and then linked to a manufacturer device tracking database. All-cause mortality, heart failure (HF) rehospitalization, and mitral valve reintervention (surgical or transcatheter valve-in-valve) were evaluated at 10 years by using the Kaplan-Meier method.
RESULTS: Among 75,739 Medicare beneficiaries undergoing SMVR during the study period, 14,015 received the Epic mitral valve (Abbott), 76.5% (10,720) of whom had underlying HF. The mean age was 74 ± 8 years. Survival at 10 years in patients without preoperative HF was 40.4% (95% CI, 37.4%-43.4%) compared with 25.4% (95% CI ,23.8%-27.0%) for patients with HF (P < .001). The 10-year freedom from HF rehospitalization was 51.3% (95% CI, 49.4%-53.1%). Freedom from mitral valve reintervention was 91.4% (95% CI, 89.7%-92.7%) at 10 years.
CONCLUSIONS: This real-world nationwide study of Medicare beneficiaries receiving the Epic mitral valve demonstrates >90% freedom from all-cause valve reintervention and >50% freedom from HF rehospitalization at 10 years after implantation. Long-term survival and HF rehospitalization in this population with mitral valve disease treated with SMVR was found to be affected by underlying HF.","['Evelio Rodriguez', 'Robert Smith', 'Luis Castro', 'Craig J Baker', 'Yang Yu', 'Julie B Prillinger', 'Dan Gutfinger', 'Vaughn A Starnes']",The Annals of thoracic surgery,2025-05-12,10.1016/j.athoracsur.2024.07.032,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.athoracsur.2024.07.032,,Paid,Ten Year Follow Up of Mitral Valve Replacement With the Epic Porcine Valve in a Medicare Population RODRIGUEZ 2025,Not available,"['Epic mitral valve', 'Mitral Valve Replacement', 'Mitral Valve', 'Epic Porcine Valve', 'Valve', 'Epic mitral', 'Valve Replacement', 'Mitral', 'mitral porcine valve', 'Medicare']",2025-05-12,Pending,[]
40350498,Feasibility of Self-Expanding Transcatheter Pulmonary Valves in Patients with Pyramidal RVOT: Favorable Mid-term Outcomes.,"Transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement (TPVR) is effective for treating significant pulmonary regurgitation (PR), but mid-term data in patients with pyramidal right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) anatomy are limited. This multi-center retrospective study included patients who underwent TPVR between May 2014 and September 2023. Baseline and echocardiographic data were compared between patients with pyramidal and non-pyramidal RVOT. The primary endpoint was peri-procedural device success, defined as technical success, optimal valve function on discharge echocardiography (RVOT gradient < 30 mmHg, less than moderate PR, no significant paravalvular leak), and absence of in-hospital mortality or re-intervention. The secondary endpoint was 1-year freedom from all-cause mortality, cardiac hospitalization, endocarditis, significant stent fracture, valve dysfunction, and device-related re-intervention. Sixty-eight patients were enrolled. Device success was achieved in 86.7% of pyramidal RVOT patients and 100% of non-pyramidal patients (P = 0.067). At 1 year, no significant difference was observed in the composite secondary endpoint (91.7% vs. 86.0%, P = 0.605). Both groups showed similar improvements in echocardiographic and clinical outcomes. Additionally, no statistically significant differences were observed between the two groups regarding post-TPVR regurgitation and paravalvular leakage. TPVR using self-expanding valves in pyramidal RVOT showed acceptable device success rates and favorable mid-term outcomes in both clinical and hemodynamic parameters. Morphology-based pre-procedural planning is essential for optimizing results.","['Wenhao Zhu', 'Zhiyuan Xia', 'Jeffery Shi Kai Chan', 'Junyi Wan', 'Liang Xu', 'Yihang Li', 'Jingnan Zhang', 'Gary Tse', 'Fang Fang', 'Gejun Zhang']",Pediatric cardiology,2025-05-12,10.1007/s00246-025-03876-8,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00246-025-03876-8,PMC6398292,Free,Feasibility of Self Expanding Transcatheter Pulmonary Valves in Patients with Pyramidal RVOT Favorable Mid term Outcomes ZHU 2025,pdfs\Feasibility of Self Expanding Transcatheter Pulmonary Valves in Patients with Pyramidal RVOT Favorable Mid term Outcomes ZHU 2025.pdf,"['STROBE guidelines', 'study', 'observational study', 'STROBE', 'Transcatheter Pulmonary Valves', 'study design', 'observational', 'guidelines', 'pyramidal RVOT patients', 'Transcatheter Pulmonary']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Computed tomography', 'Congenital heart disease', 'Transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement']"

Herein we present a case of recurrent fungemia with C. glabrata in a middle-aged woman with Tetralogy of Fallot who had a right ventricle to pulmonary artery conduit, and a transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement in the past. Her isolate showed increasing minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) to various antifungals with higher MICs to azoles, including resistance to fluconazole, resulting in limited treatment options.

40327023,Clinical and Electrophysiological Characteristics of Inducible Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia in Repaired Tetralogy of Fallot.,"BACKGROUND: Although sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (MVT) in repaired tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is linked to abnormally conducting anatomical isthmuses, the clinical importance of inducible polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (PVT) is unclear.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the clinical and electrophysiological characteristics of inducible PVT in TOF.
METHODS: Patients from the ongoing CATAPULT-TOF (Catheter Ablation of Ventricular Tachycardia Before Transcatheter Pulmonary Valve Replacement in Repaired Tetralogy of Fallot) registry with inducible sustained PVT at index electrophysiology study were included. Abnormal anatomical isthmus was defined as conduction velocity <0.5 m/s. Centrally adjudicated episodes with ≥3 consecutive beats of similar morphology (10 of 12 leads) were labeled transiently organized PVT (TO-PVT). TO-PVT was analyzed in relation to three-dimensional substrate characteristics and postablation inducibility.
RESULTS: Of 186 patients (mean age 40 years; 55% male), sustained PVT was induced at 27 procedures (15%). Patients with PVT vs MVT were more likely to undergo operation in the current era (P = 0.008), not require palliative shunt (P = 0.01), exhibit a lower right ventricular end-diastolic volume/left ventricular end-diastolic volume ratio (P = 0.02), and harbor faster anatomical isthmus conduction velocity (P = 0.03). Of those with available electrocardiography data, greater number of TO beats was associated with ≥1 anatomical isthmus (median 3 vs 0 beats; P = 0.001). The proportion with TO-PVT decreased with catheter ablation, with 14 of 24 identified at baseline (58%; median 3.5 beats; cycle length 181 milliseconds), 3 (23%) of 13 postablation, and 1 (8%) of 13 at follow-up electrophysiology study (Ptrend = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with inducible PVT display a lower clinical risk profile and healthier myocardial substrate than those with MVT. Organized beats at episode onset appear to be associated with anatomical isthmuses that can be targeted by catheter ablation.","['Jeremy P Moore', 'Eihab Ghantous', 'Victor Waldmann', 'Francis Bessière', 'Nawel Babouri', 'Mitchell I Cohen', ""Edward T O'Leary"", 'Nimesh S Patel', 'Babak Nazer', 'Weiyi Tan', 'Frank A Fish', 'Aarti S Dalal', 'Elisabetta Mariucci', 'Reina B Tan', 'Michael S Lloyd', 'Christopher J McLeod', 'Charles C Anderson', 'Ronald J Kanter', 'Bryce V Johnson', 'Bo Wang', 'Philip M Chang', 'Paul Khairy']",JACC.

40320149,Mid-term ventricular function in patients with tetralogy of Fallot after transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement: Relationship to baseline right ventricular loading conditions.,"BACKGROUND: We investigated the mid-term systolic ventricular response to transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement (TPVR) in patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) and pulmonary stenosis (PS), pulmonary regurgitation (PR) and a MIXED subgroup that included patients with both PR and PS.
METHODS: We included patients with repaired TOF with PS, atresia and absent pulmonary valve underwent TPVR (2007-2011) and followed at BCH until 2021. We compared their serial clinical, echo imaging as well as cardiopulmonary exercise test data among PS, PR and MIXED subgroups.
RESULTS: In 63 patients (20.8 years of age) the median early follow-up (FU) after TPVR was 6.2 months, and mid-term - 2.8 years. At baseline, the PR (n = 23) had lower LV EF, mass z-scores and global longitudinal strain (GLS) and the percent predicted peak O2 pulse than PS (n = 16) and those in the MIXED (n = 24) subgroups. BiV GLS improvement from baseline to early and to midterm FU occurred for all subgroups except for the LV GLS in the MIXED, which showed improvement from baseline to early follow-up. PR subgroup's LV GLS had gradual improvement, it remained lower than in PS and MIXED. No significant difference in exercise parameters were seen following TPVR. Freedom from reintervention at 10 years of FU was only 13.4 %.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PR had lower LV systolic function and exercise capacity than those with PS or MIXED prior TPVR with normalization of systolic function midterm in all thereafter.

40319622,Perioperative management and outcomes of surgical pulmonary valve replacement following tetralogy of fallot repair: A retrospective study.,"BACKGROUND: While the long-term prognosis of Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) repair is favourable, the frequency of interventions for pulmonary valve insufficiency during follow-up remains high, raising concerns regarding its invasiveness. This study aimed to evaluate the safety measures and strategies for the perioperative management of pulmonary valve interventions following TOF repair.
METHODS: From November 2022 to December 2023, interventions in the pulmonary artery for TOF were performed in 17 patients; a retrospective analysis was conducted on all patients. Preoperative haemodynamic evaluation was performed using 4D-flow magnetic resonance imaging in all cases.
RESULTS: The 17 patients included in the study had a mean age of 24.1 ± 14 years. The mean duration from repair to re-intervention was 18.2 ± 12 years, with a preoperative right ventricular ejection fraction of 42.3 ± 12 %. The mean surgical time, cardiopulmonary bypass time, and aortic cross-clamp time were 389 ± 96, 210 ± 67, and 106 ± 48 min, respectively. Pulmonary valve replacement was performed in eight patients, with seven using porcine aortic valves and one using a bovine pericardial valve. The Rastelli-type procedure was performed in nine cases, with seven using expanded polytetrafluoroethylene valved conduits and two using composite grafts of a porcine bioprosthetic valve and Valsalva graft. Additional procedures included right ventricular outflow tract myectomy in nine patients, pulmonary artery reconstruction in five, cryoablation in four, coronary artery bypass grafting in three, tricuspid valve repair in three, and ventricular septal defect closure in one. There were no cases of early mortality, stroke, or re-operation within 30 days.
CONCLUSION: Interventions on the pulmonary valves following TOF repair can be safely performed with appropriate perioperative management. The primary goal of surgical pulmonary valve replacement is to preserve the right ventricular function and reconstruct a smooth pathway from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery, considering future transcatheter interventions. Further long-term follow-up is necessary to assess outcomes, such as remote mortality, right ventricular function, and arrhythmia occurrence.","['Chiaki Aichi', 'Keiichi Itatani', 'Yosuke Nakai', 'Takumi Kawase', 'Jiryo Haibara', 'Satoki Ozoe', 'Hisao Suda']",International journal of surgery case reports,2025-05-03,10.1016/j.ijscr.2025.111406,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2025.111406,,Paid,Perioperative management and outcomes of surgical pulmonary valve replacement following tetralogy of fallot repair A retrospective study AICHI 2025,Not available,"['tetralogy of fallot', 'pulmonary valve', 'pulmonary', 'pulmonary valve replacement', 'TOF', 'TOF repair', 'valve', 'surgical pulmonary valve', 'Perioperative management', 'pulmonary artery']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['4D-flow magnetic resonance imaging', 'Pulmonary valve replacement', 'Tetralogy of Fallot']"
40314376,[Treatment options in carcinoid heart disease].,"Neuroendocrine tumours (NET) constitute a heterogenous population of malignancies most often originating from the gastrointestinal tract. NETs cause substantial morbidity, both from local growth and from their ability to produce hormones that affect systemic physiology. About 20% of patients with metastatic NET disease and carcinoid syndrome develop carcinoid heart disease, a condition dominated by primarily right-sided heart failure caused by structural deterioration of the tricuspid and pulmonary valves. Ultimately, valve replacement may be indicated and has been shown to reduce heart failure symptoms and increase long-term survival. Bioprostheses are the valves of choice but have been shown to degenerate early in some patients due to chronic tumour-associated hormonal activity. New transcatheter treatment options are emerging, both as valve-in-valve procedures but potentially also as primary interventions, both in the tricuspid and pulmonary valve position.","['Rickard Lindblom', 'Staffan Welin', 'Johan Forsblad', 'Anders Holmström', 'Azad Amin', 'Johannes Bergsten', 'Anders Albåge']",Lakartidningen,2025-05-02,No DOI Found,No Full Text Link,,Paid,[Treatment options in carcinoid heart disease] LINDBLOM 2025,Not available,"['carcinoid heart disease', 'heart', 'Treatment options', 'carcinoid heart', 'heart disease', 'carcinoid', 'disease', 'heart failure', 'metastatic NET disease', 'tricuspid and pulmonary']",2025-05-12,Pending,[]
40311671,"Heart Function, Valvular Hemodynamics, and Early-term Outcomes of Possible Thrombosis in Self-Expanding Transcatheter Pulmonary Valve.","BACKGROUND: The clinical implications of hypoattenuating leaflet thickening (HALT) and its potential link to thrombosis detected via CT scans in post-TPVR patients are unknown. The study aimed to explore the prevalence, heart function, valvular hemodynamics, and early outcomes of HALT after transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement (TPVR) METHODS: We studied 64 of 76 consecutive multicenter patients undergoing TPVR, with the implantation of Venus-P device. CT characteristics within a year, echocardiographic data, and early-term clinical endpoints were analyzed in patients with and without HALT.
RESULTS: CT scans revealed HALT in 28 patients (56%) and reduced leaflet motion (RLM) in 11 patients (20.8%) within one year [median interval 184 days (IQR: 104 to 214)]. HALT patients exhibited a lower percentage of normal tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion at the CT scan time (58.3% versus 73.7%; P = 0.020), although valvular hemodynamics and clinical endpoints were similar. Older age at intervention (OR: 1.05; 95% CI: 1.01-1.09) and larger body mass index (OR: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.01-1.36) were associated with HALT, while the use of anticoagulation was not identified as a protective factor. The HALT severity was positively correlated with the degree of leaflet motion (r = 0.67 and 0.69, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: HALT was highly prevalent, though it was subclinical. Early follow-up showed uneventful valvular hemodynamics and clinical outcomes. However, the HALT group exhibited suboptimal right ventricular function during CT scans, with older age and higher BMI linked to this issue.","['Wenhao Zhu', 'Zhiyuan Xia', 'Jiaxin Xie', 'Junyi Wan', 'Zhihui Hou', 'Liang Xu', 'Haiyue Xie', 'Yihang Li', 'Jingnan Zhang', 'Yu Han', 'Xiangbin Pan', 'Gary Tse', 'Jeffrey Shi Kai Chan', 'Fang Fang', 'Gejun Zhang']",The Canadian journal of cardiology,2025-04-29,10.1016/j.cjca.2025.04.021,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2025.04.021,,Paid,Heart Function Valvular Hemodynamics and Early term Outcomes of Possible Thrombosis in Self Expanding Transcatheter Pulmonary Valve ZHU 2025,Not available,"['Transcatheter Pulmonary Valve', 'Self-Expanding Transcatheter Pulmonary', 'Transcatheter Pulmonary', 'Pulmonary Valve', 'Valvular Hemodynamics', 'HALT', 'pulmonary valve replacement', 'Heart Function', 'Self-Expanding Transcatheter', 'Hemodynamics']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Computed tomography', 'Congenital heart disease', 'Thrombosis', 'Transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement']"
40298961,Safety of Direct Oral Anticoagulants in Transcatheter Pulmonary Valves: A Pediatric Institution's Experience.,"Transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement (TPVR) is associated with an increased risk of valve leaflet thrombosis and leaflet dysfunction requiring thromboprophylaxis. The use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in pediatric patients with TPVRs is currently off-label without established data on safety and efficacy. The primary objective was a composite safety score consisting of clinically relevant non-major bleeding, major bleeding, bleeding-related re-admission, and medication discontinuation. The secondary objective consisted of the individual components of the composite score, in addition to valve thrombosis as represented by increasing transvalvular gradient by echocardiogram and valve complication requiring re-intervention. A single center, retrospective, descriptive study of pediatric patients who underwent TPVR placement. Patients were included in this study if they were less than 18 years old and received a DOAC in addition to low dose aspirin (standard of care) post procedure for thromboprophylaxis. Thirty-one patients were identified, of which 21 were males (68%) with a median age of 14 years (IQR: 13, 16) and median weight of 49 kg (IQR: 49, 60). Of the 31 patients, 4 (13%) met the composite outcome with all 4 patients having minor bleeding (13%), and one patient requiring hospital readmission for a minor bleed (3.2%). There were no major bleeds or bleeding-related deaths. No patients developed a valve thrombosis or valve complication requiring re-intervention. DOACs may be safe in pediatric patients after TPVR. No patients experienced major bleeding, and only one had clinically relevant non-major bleeding.

40240943,Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction Phenotype Is Associated With Early Symptom Onset in Aortic Stenosis and Residual Symptoms After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.,"BACKGROUND: Aortic stenosis can lead to cardiac adaptations and symptoms similar to heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. We hypothesized that a heart failure with preserved ejection fraction phenotype in aortic stenosis is associated with earlier onset of symptoms and reduced symptomatic response after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).
METHODS AND RESULTS: This retrospective cohort study included 469 patients with moderate aortic stenosis. We determined heavy, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary, elder, filling pressure (H2FPEF) score at diagnosis and compared aortic peak jet velocity at onset of dyspnea in patients with low (<6) and high (≥6) H2FPEF score. In a separate cohort of 601 patients undergoing TAVI, we compared New York Heart Association class, NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide), and cardiovascular mortality post-TAVI between patients with low and high H2FPEF scores. In patients with aortic stenosis and a high H2FPEF score (n=43, 9.2%), the median peak jet velocity at onset of dyspnea was 4.2 versus 4.4 m/s in patients with a low H2FPEF score (P<0.001). After TAVI, a high H2FPEF score (n=123, 20%) was associated with a lower proportion of New York Heart Association class I at 30 days (49% versus 61%; P=0.04), persistently elevated NT-proBNP, and higher 5-year rate of cardiovascular mortality (36% versus 30%; P=0.012), compared with a low H2FPEF score.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with aortic stenosis with a heart failure with preserved ejection fraction phenotype are more likely to develop symptoms at lower gradients and have worse outcomes post-TAVI. Randomized trials are warranted to investigate whether medical therapy targeted at heart failure with preserved ejection fraction delays onset of symptoms and improves symptomatic response after TAVI.","['Constantijn S Venema', 'Kees H van Bergeijk', 'Jan A Krikken', 'Hindrik W van der Werf', 'Ad F M van den Heuvel', 'Yvonne L Douglas', 'Ify R Mordi', 'Nicolas Girerd', 'Chim C Lang', 'Carolyn S P Lam', 'Martin B Leon', 'Erik Lipsic', 'Michiel Rienstra', 'Adriaan A Voors', 'Joanna J Wykrzykowska']",Journal of the American Heart Association,2025-05-06,10.1161/JAHA.124.038786,https://doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.124.038786,,Paid,Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction Phenotype Is Associated With Early Symptom Onset in Aortic Stenosis and Residual Symptoms After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation VENEMA 2025,Not available,"['Preserved Ejection Fraction', 'Ejection Fraction Phenotype', 'Aortic Valve Implantation', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Early Symptom Onset', 'Failure With Preserved', 'Preserved Ejection', 'Ejection Fraction', 'Aortic Stenosis', 'Heart Failure']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['H2FPEF score', 'aortic stenosis', 'aortic valve intervention', 'heart failure', 'structural heart disease']"
40214963,Long-term age-stratified outcomes after surgical and transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a Dutch cohort study.,"BACKGROUND: While randomised trials have shown that surgical and transcutaneous aortic valve replacement/implantation (SAVR/TAVI) have similar short- to mid-term outcomes, long-term outcome data are scarce. Additionally, no large-scale long-term follow-up data from Dutch databases and TAVI centres have been reported to inform national guidelines.
METHODS: We retrospectively analysed baseline characteristics, 5‑year mortality and re-intervention rates of patients undergoing isolated SAVR or TAVI, stratified by age (65-75, 75-80 and > 80 years old) in the Netherlands Heart Registry.
RESULTS: From 2013 through 2021, 7879 SAVR patients (median age: 73.0 years; interquartile range (IQR): 69.0-77.0; 43.7% female) and 14,461 TAVI patients (median age: 81.0 years; IQR: 77.0-84.0; 49.9% female) were treated in the Netherlands. Patients undergoing TAVI more frequently had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, dialysis, poor mobility, previous stroke, unstable angina and recent myocardial infarction compared with SAVR patients. This higher comorbidity rate in TAVI was observed across all age groups. After 5‑year follow-up, mortality rates were higher after TAVI compared with SAVR (35.5% vs 13.0%; p < 0.001). This difference decreased with increasing age (p for interaction < 0.001). While the aortic re-intervention rate was low in both cohorts, it was higher after SAVR than TAVI (1.9% vs 0.9%; p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Demographics of patients undergoing SAVR versus TAVI in the Netherlands differed substantially. TAVI patients were older and had more comorbidities than SAVR patients, across all age groups. Mortality rates were highest after TAVI, while aortic re-intervention was more common after SAVR. These findings reflect differences in baseline patient characteristics and current daily practice in decision-making by the Heart Teams.","['Kees van Bergeijk', 'Stijn Venema', 'Ad van den Heuvel', 'Rik van der Werf', 'Wobbe Bouma', 'Yvonne Douglas', 'Niki Medendorp', 'Marijke Timmermans', 'Adriaan Voors', 'Joanna J Wykrzykowska']",Netherlands heart journal : monthly journal of the Netherlands Society of Cardiology and the Netherlands Heart Foundation,2025-05-12,10.1007/s12471-025-01944-5,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12471-025-01944-5,PMC12014882,Free,Long term age stratified outcomes after surgical and transcatheter aortic valve replacement a Dutch cohort study BERGEIJK 2025,pdfs\Long term age stratified outcomes after surgical and transcatheter aortic valve replacement a Dutch cohort study BERGEIJK 2025.pdf,"['TAVI', 'SAVR', 'Netherlands Heart Registry', 'SAVR patients', 'SAVR versus TAVI', 'TAVI patients', 'Netherlands', 'Netherlands Heart', 'patients', 'Heart Registry']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Comorbidities', 'Long-term outcomes', 'SAVR', 'TAVI']"
40045877,Image-Derived Modeling to Assess Coronary Proximity in Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Pulmonary Valve Replacement With Self-Expanding Valves.,"BACKGROUND: The potential for coronary artery compression (CC) during transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement (TPVR) using self-expanding valves (SEV) is not fully understood, yet anecdotal reports suggest that this risk exists.
AIMS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients evaluated for SEV-TPVR to evaluate the relationship between the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) and coronary arteries (CA). CT-derived segmentations of the RVOT and CA were created using machine learning. A 2D map of the distance between the RVOT surface and CA, in systole and diastole, was created. In the subset of patients with post-procedural CTA, the distance before and after TPVR was measured.
RESULTS: Forty-two individuals underwent screening for SEV-TPVR, of which 83% (n = 35) had SEV implanted (Harmony = 24; Alterra = 11). Median age was 22.9 years (range 12-60) and 76% had tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). There was no significant change in the distance between the RVOT and LCA between diastole and systole (p = 0.31), yet the RVOT area nearest to the LCA displaced proximally by 11 mm (IQR: 5.6-19.9) in systole. In 8 patients with pre- and post-TPVR CTA, no statistically significant differences were observed in the RVOT-to-LCA relation after intervention. The distance to the LCA was smaller in pulmonary stenosis/atresia patients than those with TOF (median distance 1.2 and 2.1 mm, respectively; p = 0.185).
CONCLUSION: The RVOT area in closest proximity to LCA is dynamic and should be considered when planning TPVR. Special attention should be given to patients with a diagnosis of pulmonary stenosis/atresia.","['Yuval Barak-Corren', 'Vladislav Obsekov', 'Mudit Gupta', 'Christian Herz', 'Silvani Amin', 'Andras Lasso', ""Michael L O'Byrne"", 'Matthew J Gillespie', 'Matthew A Jolley']",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,2025-05-12,10.1002/ccd.31469,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.31469,PMC12058398,Paid,Image Derived Modeling to Assess Coronary Proximity in Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Pulmonary Valve Replacement With Self Expanding Valves BARAK-CORREN 2025,Not downloaded,"['Transcatheter Pulmonary Valve', 'Pulmonary Valve Replacement', 'Undergoing Transcatheter Pulmonary', 'Patients Undergoing Transcatheter', 'Modeling to Assess', 'Assess Coronary Proximity', 'Valve Replacement', 'Undergoing Transcatheter', 'Image-Derived Modeling', 'Self-Expanding Valves']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['3D modeling', 'coronary artery compression (CC)', 'machine learning', 'self‐expanding valves (SEV)', 'transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement (TPVR)']"
39945978,Tricuspid regurgitation after heart transplantation: where innovation and intervention are in hibernation.,"Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is a common valvular dysfunction following heart transplantation (HT), with reported prevalence rates ranging from 19 to 84%, primarily depending on the duration of follow-up. Its etiology is multifactorial and includes surgical technique, ischemic time, primary graft dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, pacemaker leads, and endomyocardial biopsies. Severe TR can significantly impair graft function, exercise capacity, and patient survival. This mini-review explores current management strategies, including surgical techniques such as annuloplasty and tricuspid valve replacement. HT patients are often high-risk surgical candidates due to factors such as immunosuppressive therapy, prior surgeries, and various comorbidities. Therefore, we primarily focus on the evidence regarding emerging interventional methods, such as transcatheter edge-to-edge repair. Although these interventions show promising early results, they remain relatively novel in HT recipients, and the current evidence is based on case reports and small studies. Further research is essential to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of these management strategies to enhance outcomes for HT recipients with TR.","['Emyal Alyaydin', 'Alexander Gotschy', 'Danaë Parianos', 'Matthias P Nägele', 'Igor Tudorache', 'Andreas J Flammer', 'Julia Stehli']",Heart failure reviews,2025-05-12,10.1007/s10741-025-10494-2,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10741-025-10494-2,PMC11991953,Free,Tricuspid regurgitation after heart transplantation where innovation and intervention are in hibernation ALYAYDIN 2025,pdfs\Tricuspid regurgitation after heart transplantation where innovation and intervention are in hibernation ALYAYDIN 2025.pdf,"['heart', 'heart transplantation', 'University Hospital Zurich', 'Tricuspid regurgitation', 'donor heart', 'Tricuspid', 'Zurich', 'Heart Failure Reviews', 'surgical technique', 'pulmonary']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Heart transplantation', 'Heart valve prosthesis implantation', 'Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair', 'Tricuspid regurgitation']"
39903642,The reversibility of cardiac damage after transcatheter aortic valve implantation and short-term outcomes in a real-world setting.,"AIMS: This study aims to assess the changes in cardiac damage stage in a real-world cohort of patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), and to investigate the prognostic value of cardiac damage stage evolution.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing TAVI were retrospectively analysed. A five-stage system based on the presence and extent of cardiac damage assessed by echocardiography was applied before and 6 months after TAVI. Multivariable Cox regression analyses were used to examine independent prognostic value of the changes in cardiac damage after TAVI. A total of 734 patients with severe AS (mean age, 79.8 ± 7.4 years; 55% male) were included. Before TAVI, 32 (4%) patients did not show any sign of extra-valvular cardiac damage (Stage 0), 85 (12%) had left ventricular damage (Stage 1), 220 (30%) left atrial and/or mitral valve damage (Stage 2), 227 (31%) pulmonary vasculature and/or tricuspid valve damage (Stage 3), and 170 (23%) right ventricular damage (Stage 4). Six months after TAVI, 39% of the patients improved at least one stage in cardiac damage. Staging of cardiac damage at 6 months after TAVI [hazard ratio (HR) per one-stage increase, 1.391; P = 0.035] as well as worsening in the stage of cardiac damage (HR, 3.729; P = 0.005) were independently associated with 2-year all-cause mortality.
CONCLUSION: More than one-third of patients with severe AS showed an improvement in cardiac damage 6 months after TAVI. Staging cardiac damage at baseline and follow-up may improve risk stratification in patients undergoing TAVI.","['Rinchyenkhand Myagmardorj', 'Federico Fortuni', 'Philippe Généreux', 'Takeru Nabeta', 'Jan Stassen', 'Xavier Galloo', 'Maria Chiara Meucci', 'Steele Butcher', 'Frank van der Kley', 'David J Cohen', 'Marie-Annick Clavel', 'Philippe Pibarot', 'Martin B Leon', 'Madelien V Regeer', 'Victoria Delgado', 'Nina Ajmone Marsan', 'Jeroen J Bax']",European heart journal.

39710301,Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Aortic Stenosis Patients With New York Heart Association Functional Class III or IV.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with symptomatic aortic stenosis are a vulnerable population with associated cardiac damage and a significant comorbidity burden. In this study we aimed to determine the rate, factors associated with, and prognostic value of poor functional status (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class III-IV) in patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
METHODS: This multicenter study included 6363 transarterial TAVR patients, classified according to baseline functional status (NYHA class I or II vs III or IV).
RESULTS: A total of 3800 (60%) patients presented with NYHA class III or IV before the TAVR procedure. Atrial fibrillation (odds ratio [OR], 1.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-1.58; P = 0.002), chronic kidney disease (CKD; OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.45-2.05; P < 0.001), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; OR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.32-2.05; P < 0.001), reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (OR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.70-3.05; P < 0.001), and moderate and severe pulmonary hypertension were associated with a poor functional status. At 1-year follow-up, patients with NYHA class III or IV had higher rates of mortality (8.81 per 100 person-years [95% CI, 7.57-10.15] vs 13.12 per 100 person-years [95% CI, 11.80-14.58]; log rank, P < 0.001) and heart failure hospitalization (8.25 per 100 person-years [95% CI, 7.05-9.65] vs 12.5 per 100 person-years [95% CI, 11.24-14.00]; log rank, P = 0.005). Comorbidity factors (COPD, CKD) and signs of cardiac damage (atrial fibrillation, pulmonary hypertension) determined an increased risk of poorer clinical outcomes (P < 0.01 for all).
CONCLUSIONS: More than half of the patients undergoing TAVR in the contemporary era have presented with advanced functional class before the procedure, and this was associated with a greater comorbidity and cardiac damage burden. Patients with poorer baseline functional status exhibited worse clinical outcomes at 1-year follow-up. These findings highlight the need for further study on earlier interventions for patients with aortic stenosis.","['Jorge Nuche', 'Jules Mesnier', 'Julien Ternacle', 'Effat Rezaei', 'Francisco Campelo-Parada', 'Marina Urena', 'Gabriela Veiga-Fernandez', 'Luis Nombela-Franco', 'Anna Franzone', 'Antonio J Munoz-Garcia', 'Victoria Vilalta', 'Ander Regueiro', 'David Del Val', 'Lluis Asmarats', 'Maria Del Trigo', 'Vicenç Serra', 'Guillaume Bonnet', 'Melchior Jonveaux', 'Ronan Canitrot', 'Dominique Himbert', 'Jose Maria de la Torre Hernandez', 'Gabriela Tirado-Conte', 'Eduard Fernandez-Nofrerias', 'Pedro Cepas', 'Fernando Alfonso', 'Lola Gutierrez-Alonso', 'Juan Francisco Oteo', 'Yassin Belahnech', 'Siamak Mohammadi', 'Thomas Modine', 'Marisa Avvedimento', 'Josep Rodés-Cabau', 'Asim N Cheema']",The Canadian journal of cardiology,2025-05-12,10.1016/j.cjca.2024.12.025,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2024.12.025,,Paid,Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Aortic Stenosis Patients With New York Heart Association Functional Class III or IV NUCHE 2025,Not available,"['York Heart Association', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'NYHA class III', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Aortic Stenosis', 'Heart Association Functional', 'York Heart', 'Heart Association', 'Association Functional Class', 'Class III']",2025-05-12,Pending,[]
39442866,Durability of right ventricular conduits in the Ross procedure.,"BACKGROUND: Right ventricular (RV) conduit availability and degeneration are potential limitations of the Ross procedure. Pulmonary homografts are the gold standard, but their limited availability drives the need for alternatives. The aim of this study was to compare results of different RV conduits.
METHODS: Between 1995 and 2023, 315 consecutive patients (73% males; mean age, 37 ± 12 years) underwent a Ross procedure using a homograft (n = 211), bovine jugular vein (BJV) (n = 34), or xenograft (n = 70) as the RV conduit. The mean follow-up was 5.7 ± 6.7 years and was 96% complete (1631 patient-years).
RESULTS: Twelve patients (homograft, n = 8; BJV. n = 3; xenograft, n = 1) required RV conduit reintervention, including 4 patients within 4 years (all with homografts). Indications for reintervention were degeneration in 8 patients and active endocarditis in 4 patients. Reinterventions included RV conduit replacement (homograft, n = 3; xenograft, n = 1; BJV, n = 2) and transcatheter valve implantation (homograft n = 5; BJV, n = 1). At 15 years, freedom from RV conduit reintervention was 88%, and freedom from reoperation was 93%. Freedom from reintervention at 15 years was similar in the homograft (89%), BJV (89%), and xenograft (100%) groups (P = .812). Progression of mean RV conduit gradient was lowest for the BJV group (1.45 mm Hg/year) and similar in the homograft (2.6 mm Hg/year) and xenograft (2.9 mm Hg/year) groups. Age at <18 years at surgery (hazard ratio [HR], 1.9; P < .001) was a predictive risk factor for reintervention. There was no difference among the RV conduit groups (HR, 1.198; P = .606).
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of reintervention after 15 years is similar in recipients of homografts, xenografts, and BJV grafts. Interestingly, homografts may fail in the first few years, possibly related to inflammatory phenomena. Thus, the use of xenografts may be an option if homografts are not available.","['Karen B Abeln', 'Lennart Froede', 'Christian Giebels', 'Hans-Joachim Schäfers']",The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,2025-05-12,10.1016/j.jtcvs.2024.10.023,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcvs.2024.10.023,,Paid,Durability of right ventricular conduits in the Ross procedure ABELN 2025,Not available,"['Ross procedure', 'Ross', 'BJV', 'conduit', 'years', 'reintervention', 'homograft', 'homografts', 'xenograft', 'procedure']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Ross procedure', 'homograft', 'right ventricular conduit']"
40353875,Evidence of bioprosthetic valve dysfunction during three-year follow-up following TAVR.,"OBJECTIVE: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has increased significantly in younger patients and patients at lower surgical risk. In this retrospective multicenter study, we aimed to assess for bioprosthetic valve dysfunction (BVD) during three-year follow-up (FU) and potential differences between self-expandable (SEV) and balloon-expandable valves (BEV) under real-world conditions.
METHODS: Endpoints were defined according to VARC-3 criteria, including VARC composite endpoints during three-year FU.
RESULTS: A total of 1233 patients with tricuspid aortic valve stenosis, who underwent TAVR with contemporary transcatheter heart valve (THV) devices from three different tertiary care centers were included. One-fifth of the study population showed BVD at three-year FU (BVD[-]: n = 957;77.6%; BVD[+]: n = 276;22.4%). Non-structural valve deterioration (NSVD) was the most represented category (8.5%) followed by structural valve deterioration (SVD, 5.3%). BVD was more common in association with BEV as compared with SEV (60.9% vs 39.1%; p < 0.001) owing to higher rates of SVD (13.5% vs 9.5%; p = 0.028) and NSVD (17.9% vs. 13.8%; p = 0.048). Subclinical leaflet thrombosis was only documented in BEV (1.7%, p < 0.001). At three years, all-cause mortality was higher in BVD+ patients (BVD[-] vs. BVD[+]: 13.2% vs. 22.5%; HR: 1.99; 95%-CI: 1.39-2.85; p < 0.001*) but did not differ between THV platform.
CONCLUSION: BVD after TAVR is common and associated with higher all-cause mortality. Despite a preponderance of BVD in association with balloon-expandable valves, mortality rates remain similar between THV platforms.

40353871,Predictive performance of the TRI-SCORE in patients with severe aortic stenosis and concomitant tricuspid regurgitation undergoing TAVR.,"BACKGROUND: Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is a common comorbidity in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and represents a significant predictor of adverse outcomes. Precise risk stratification through clinical scoring systems is vital for tailoring treatment decisions in this patient population.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the applicability of the TRI-SCORE for predicting adverse outcomes in patients with AS and concomitant moderate-to-severe TR undergoing TAVR and to compare its performance with established surgical risk scores like the EuroSCORE II and Society of Thoracic Surgeons score (STS-Score).
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 301 patients with severe AS and concomitant TR who underwent TAVR between 2013 and 2022 at the Heart Center Bonn. According to the TRI-SCORE, patients were stratified into a low or intermediate-risk group (TRI-SCORE 0-5) and a high-risk group (TRI-SCORE 6-12). The primary endpoint was 2-year all-cause mortality. Predictive values of the TRI-SCORE were compared to the EuroSCORE II and the STS-Score for both 30-day and 2-year mortality outcomes.
RESULTS: The 2-year mortality rate was significantly higher in the high-risk group compared to the low or intermediate-risk group (TRI-SCORE 6-12: 40.0% vs. TRI-SCORE 0-5: 17.9%; p < 0.001). For predicting 30-day mortality, the EuroSCORE II and the STS-Score demonstrated superior predictive values, with AUCs of 78.4% and 83.0%, respectively, in comparison to the TRI-SCORE, which showed an AUC of 70.0%. Conversely, the TRI-SCORE allowed a better risk prediction with regard to 2-year all-cause mortality, achieving an AUC of 69.7%, superior to the EuroSCORE II (60.6%) and the STS-Score (62.1%).
CONCLUSION: The TRI-SCORE is effective in predicting mid-term mortality in patients with AS and moderate-to-severe TR undergoing TAVR, demonstrating greater robustness than the EuroSCORE II and the STS-Score for this timeframe.","['Mustafa Mousa Basha', 'Baravan Al-Kassou', 'Christopher Gestrich', 'Marcel Weber', 'Thomas Beiert', 'Sebastian Zimmer', 'Farhad Bakhtiary', 'Georg Nickenig', 'Jasmin Shamekhi']",Clinical research in cardiology : official journal of the German Cardiac Society,2025-05-12,10.1007/s00392-025-02671-y,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00392-025-02671-y,PMC5698373,Free,Predictive performance of the TRI SCORE in patients with severe aortic stenosis and concomitant tricuspid regurgitation undergoing TAVR BASHA 2025,pdfs\Predictive performance of the TRI SCORE in patients with severe aortic stenosis and concomitant tricuspid regurgitation undergoing TAVR BASH.pdf,"['patients', 'patients undergoing TAVI', 'TAVI', 'TRV', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'aortic valve', 'mortality', 'aortic valve implantation', 'all-cause mortality', 'undergoing TAVR']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Aortic valve stenosis', 'EuroSCORE II', 'STS-Score', 'TRI-SCORE', 'Transcatheter aortic valve replacement', 'Tricuspid regurgitation']"

40351685,Age Differences in Aortic Stenosis.,"Aortic stenosis (AS) is a significant and growing concern, with a prevalence of 2-3% in individuals aged over 65 years. Moreover, with an aging global population, the prevalence is anticipated to double by 2050. Indeed, AS can arise from various etiologies, including calcific trileaflets, congenital valve abnormalities (e.g., bicuspid and unicuspid valves), and post-rheumatic, whereby each has a distinct influence that shapes the onset and progression of the disease. The normal aortic valve has a trilaminar structure comprising the fibrosa, spongiosa, and ventricularis, which work together to maintain its function. In calcific AS, the disease begins with early calcification starting in high mechanical stress areas of the valve and progresses slowly over decades, eventually leading to extensive calcification resulting in impaired valve function. This process involves mechanisms similar to atherosclerosis, including lipid deposition, chronic inflammation, and mineralization. The progression of calcific AS is strongly associated with aging, with additional risk factors including male gender, smoking, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome exacerbating the condition. Conversely, congenital forms of AS, such as bicuspid and unicuspid aortic valves, result in an earlier disease onset, typically 10-20 years earlier than that observed in patients with a normal tricuspid aortic valve. Rheumatic AS, although less common in developed countries due to effective antibiotic treatments, also exhibits age-related characteristics, with an earlier onset in individuals who experienced rheumatic fever in their youth. The only curative therapies currently available are surgical and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). However, these options are sometimes too invasive for older patients; thus, management of AS, particularly in older patients, requires a comprehensive approach that considers age, disease severity, comorbidities, frailty, and each patient's individual needs. Although the valves used in TAVR demonstrate promising midterm durability, long-term data are still required, especially when used in younger individuals, usually with low surgical risk. Moreover, understanding the causes and mechanisms of structural valve deterioration is crucial for appropriate treatment selections, including valve selection and pharmacological therapy, since this knowledge is essential for optimizing the lifelong management of AS.","['Tomoyo Hamana', 'Teruo Sekimoto', 'Aloke V Finn', 'Renu Virmani']",Reviews in cardiovascular medicine,2025-04-12,10.31083/RCM28185,https://doi.org/10.31083/RCM28185,PMC12059746,Free,Age Differences in Aortic Stenosis HAMANA 2025,pdfs\Age Differences in Aortic Stenosis HAMANA 2025.pdf,"['aortic valve', 'Aortic', 'normal aortic valve', 'valve', 'Aortic Stenosis', 'tricuspid aortic valve', 'aortic valve disease', 'normal tricuspid aortic', 'calcific aortic valve', 'aortic valve leaflets']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['aortic stenosis', 'bioprosthetic valve failure', 'calcific aortic valve disease']"
40348412,Outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement in bicuspid versus tricuspid aortic stenosis with severe calcification.,"BACKGROUND: The comparative outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in bicuspid versus tricuspid aortic stenosis (AS) with severe calcification remain unclear. This study aimed to compare the safety and efficacy of TAVR in these patient groups.
METHODS: Using data from the Chinese Cardiovascular Association Database-National Transcatheter Valve Therapeutics Registry, we analysed 870 propensity score matched pairs of patients with severe calcification (≥470 mm³) undergoing TAVR between April 2014 and August 2023. Primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 1 year.
RESULTS: No significant differences were observed in technical success (95.1% vs 94.7%), procedural complications or in-hospital outcomes. All-cause mortality at 1 year was similar between bicuspid and tricuspid AS (4.3% vs 5.3%, HR 0.87; log-rank p=0.62). The incidence of stroke (1.5% vs 1.4%), cardiovascular hospitalisation (1.4% vs 1.7%) and moderate-to-severe paravalvular leak (3.5% vs 2.5%) was similar during follow-up. The rate of new permanent pacemaker implantation was higher in bicuspid AS (8.4% vs 5.6%; p=0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: TAVR was observed to be equally safe and effective in bicuspid and tricuspid AS with severe calcification, though bicuspid AS was associated with a higher rate of permanent pacemaker implantation.","['Yinghao Sun', 'Changjin Wang', 'Jie Li', 'Songyuan Luo', 'Shengneng Zheng', 'Bangyuan Yang', 'Jiaohua Chen', 'Ruixin Fan', 'Jianfang Luo']",Heart (British Cardiac Society),2025-05-10,10.1136/heartjnl-2024-324697,https://doi.org/10.1136/heartjnl-2024-324697,,Paid,Outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement in bicuspid versus tricuspid aortic stenosis with severe calcification SUN 2025,Not available,"['transcatheter aortic valve', 'aortic valve replacement', 'versus tricuspid aortic', 'tricuspid aortic stenosis', 'Transcatheter Valve Therapeutics', 'severe calcification', 'transcatheter aortic', 'aortic valve', 'Valve Therapeutics Registry', 'aortic stenosis']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Aortic stenosis', 'Bicuspid aortic valve', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement']"

40343748,Bicuspid aortic valve disease: advancements and challenges of transcatheter aortic valve implantation.,"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has revolutionized the treatment of patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS). Initially developed for patients with tricuspid aortic valve (TAV) anatomy, the procedural success and expanding indications of TAVI have spurred interest in its application to more complex aortic valve anatomies, such as the bicuspid aortic valve (BAV). The growing interest in this specific sub-set of patients with AS is driven by the recent extension of TAVI indications to younger individuals, who exhibit a notably higher incidence of bicuspid anatomy compared with older populations. Bicuspid aortic valves present distinct anatomical and pathological complexities that pose significant challenges to the conventional TAVI approach. These include asymmetric calcification, aortic root dilation (also known as BAV aortopathy), and variations in cusp fusion patterns, which can affect valve deployment, transcatheter heart valve sealing, and long-term durability. Despite these challenges, advancements in imaging techniques, valve design, and procedural strategies have led to increased adoption of TAVI in BAV patients. However, surgical aortic valve replacement still retains a more prominent role in this group compared with patients with TAVs. This preference is partly due to the exclusion of BAV patients from almost all previous randomized controlled trials, which limits the available evidence supporting the use of TAVI in this unique cohort. This state-of-the-art review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current landscape of TAVI in BAV patients, including an analysis of anatomical considerations and procedural pitfalls, as well as outcomes' improvements with new device iterations. It will also explore clinical data, tackling the risks, benefits, and the evolving role of TAVI in this unique patient cohort.","['Marco Barbanti', 'Giuliano Costa', 'Stephan Windecker', 'Francesco Maisano', 'Giulia Laterra', 'Jonathon Leipsic', 'Philipp Blanke', 'Vinayak N Bapat', 'Martin B Leon', 'John G Webb']",European heart journal,2025-05-09,10.1093/eurheartj/ehaf307,https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehaf307,,Paid,Bicuspid aortic valve disease advancements and challenges of transcatheter aortic valve implantation BARBANTI 2025,Not available,"['aortic valve implantation', 'aortic valve', 'TAVI', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'aortic', 'aortic valve disease', 'Bicuspid aortic valve', 'valve', 'BAV patients', 'Bicuspid aortic']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Aortopathy', 'Bicuspid aortic valve', 'Bioprosthesis', 'Congenital heart disease', 'Sizing', 'TAVI', 'Transcatheter aortic valve implantation']"
40324748,The American Association for Thoracic Surgery (AATS) 2025 Expert Consensus Document: Surgical management of mitral annular calcification.,"OBJECTIVE: Surgery for mitral valve disease in patients with mitral annular calcification (MAC) remains challenging. There is no consensus on the ideal management strategy or patient selection, and perioperative and periprocedural morbidity and mortality rates remain high. The recent surge of patients presenting with MAC has been accompanied by increased interest in MAC surgery and interventions. This expert consensus document is meant to provide a simplified outline for managing MAC, including patient selection, imaging, and surgical and transcatheter therapeutic options, with a particular focus on conventional surgical techniques and hybrid approaches.
METHODS: The American Association for Thoracic Surgery Clinical Practice Standards Committee assembled an international panel of cardiac surgeons and structural heart interventionalists with established expertise in the field of MAC. A comprehensive literature review was performed by the panel and a medical librarian. Clinical recommendations were developed utilizing a modified Delphi method.
RESULTS: Expert consensus was reached on 33 recommendations, with class of recommendation and level of evidence, for each of 5 main topics: (1) preoperative evaluation for patients with MAC, patient selection, and indications for intervention; (2) standard surgical techniques in MAC; (3) hybrid procedures in MAC; (4) transcatheter MAC interventions; and (5) complications and bailout of MAC surgery and interventions.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the complexity and heterogenicity of patients presenting with MAC, consensus on several key recommendations was reached by this American Association for Thoracic Surgery expert panel. These recommendations provide guidance for cardiac surgeons and structural heart interventionists in treating most patients who present with MAC.","['Ahmed E El-Eshmawi', 'Monika Halas', 'Brian T Bethea', 'Tirone E David', 'Eugene A Grossi', 'Mayra Guerrero', 'Samir Kapadia', 'Serguei Melnitchouk', 'Stephanie L Mick', 'Eduard Quintana', 'Matthew A Romano', 'Gilbert H L Tang', 'Shinya Unai', 'Ravi K Ghanta']",The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,2025-05-03,10.1016/j.jtcvs.2025.04.003,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcvs.2025.04.003,,Paid,The American Association for Thoracic Surgery AATS 2025 Expert Consensus Document Surgical management of mitral annular calcification EL-ESHMAWI 2025,Not available,"['mitral annular calcification', 'MAC', 'Thoracic Surgery', 'Association for Thoracic', 'American Association', 'Expert Consensus Document', 'MAC surgery', 'Thoracic Surgery expert', 'Thoracic Surgery Clinical', 'annular calcification']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['mitral annular calcification', 'mitral valve repair', 'mitral valve replacement']"
40319622,Perioperative management and outcomes of surgical pulmonary valve replacement following tetralogy of fallot repair: A retrospective study.,"BACKGROUND: While the long-term prognosis of Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) repair is favourable, the frequency of interventions for pulmonary valve insufficiency during follow-up remains high, raising concerns regarding its invasiveness. This study aimed to evaluate the safety measures and strategies for the perioperative management of pulmonary valve interventions following TOF repair.
METHODS: From November 2022 to December 2023, interventions in the pulmonary artery for TOF were performed in 17 patients; a retrospective analysis was conducted on all patients. Preoperative haemodynamic evaluation was performed using 4D-flow magnetic resonance imaging in all cases.
RESULTS: The 17 patients included in the study had a mean age of 24.1 ± 14 years. The mean duration from repair to re-intervention was 18.2 ± 12 years, with a preoperative right ventricular ejection fraction of 42.3 ± 12 %. The mean surgical time, cardiopulmonary bypass time, and aortic cross-clamp time were 389 ± 96, 210 ± 67, and 106 ± 48 min, respectively. Pulmonary valve replacement was performed in eight patients, with seven using porcine aortic valves and one using a bovine pericardial valve. The Rastelli-type procedure was performed in nine cases, with seven using expanded polytetrafluoroethylene valved conduits and two using composite grafts of a porcine bioprosthetic valve and Valsalva graft. Additional procedures included right ventricular outflow tract myectomy in nine patients, pulmonary artery reconstruction in five, cryoablation in four, coronary artery bypass grafting in three, tricuspid valve repair in three, and ventricular septal defect closure in one. There were no cases of early mortality, stroke, or re-operation within 30 days.
CONCLUSION: Interventions on the pulmonary valves following TOF repair can be safely performed with appropriate perioperative management. The primary goal of surgical pulmonary valve replacement is to preserve the right ventricular function and reconstruct a smooth pathway from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery, considering future transcatheter interventions. Further long-term follow-up is necessary to assess outcomes, such as remote mortality, right ventricular function, and arrhythmia occurrence.","['Chiaki Aichi', 'Keiichi Itatani', 'Yosuke Nakai', 'Takumi Kawase', 'Jiryo Haibara', 'Satoki Ozoe', 'Hisao Suda']",International journal of surgery case reports,2025-05-03,10.1016/j.ijscr.2025.111406,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2025.111406,,Paid,Perioperative management and outcomes of surgical pulmonary valve replacement following tetralogy of fallot repair A retrospective study AICHI 2025,Not available,"['tetralogy of fallot', 'pulmonary valve', 'pulmonary', 'pulmonary valve replacement', 'TOF', 'TOF repair', 'valve', 'surgical pulmonary valve', 'Perioperative management', 'pulmonary artery']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['4D-flow magnetic resonance imaging', 'Pulmonary valve replacement', 'Tetralogy of Fallot']"

NETs cause substantial morbidity, both from local growth and from their ability to produce hormones that affect systemic physiology. About 20% of patients with metastatic NET disease and carcinoid syndrome develop carcinoid heart disease, a condition dominated by primarily right-sided heart failure caused by structural deterioration of the tricuspid and pulmonary valves. Ultimately, valve replacement may be indicated and has been shown to reduce heart failure symptoms and increase long-term survival. Bioprostheses are the valves of choice but have been shown to degenerate early in some patients due to chronic tumour-associated hormonal activity. New transcatheter treatment options are emerging, both as valve-in-valve procedures but potentially also as primary interventions, both in the tricuspid and pulmonary valve position.","['Rickard Lindblom', 'Staffan Welin', 'Johan Forsblad', 'Anders Holmström', 'Azad Amin', 'Johannes Bergsten', 'Anders Albåge']",Lakartidningen,2025-05-02,No DOI Found,No Full Text Link,,Paid,[Treatment options in carcinoid heart disease] LINDBLOM 2025,Not available,"['carcinoid heart disease', 'heart', 'Treatment options', 'carcinoid heart', 'heart disease', 'carcinoid', 'disease', 'heart failure', 'metastatic NET disease', 'tricuspid and pulmonary']",2025-05-12,Pending,[]

The study aimed to explore the prevalence, heart function, valvular hemodynamics, and early outcomes of HALT after transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement (TPVR) METHODS: We studied 64 of 76 consecutive multicenter patients undergoing TPVR, with the implantation of Venus-P device. CT characteristics within a year, echocardiographic data, and early-term clinical endpoints were analyzed in patients with and without HALT.
RESULTS: CT scans revealed HALT in 28 patients (56%) and reduced leaflet motion (RLM) in 11 patients (20.8%) within one year [median interval 184 days (IQR: 104 to 214)]. HALT patients exhibited a lower percentage of normal tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion at the CT scan time (58.3% versus 73.7%; P = 0.020), although valvular hemodynamics and clinical endpoints were similar. Older age at intervention (OR: 1.05; 95% CI: 1.01-1.09) and larger body mass index (OR: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.01-1.36) were associated with HALT, while the use of anticoagulation was not identified as a protective factor. The HALT severity was positively correlated with the degree of leaflet motion (r = 0.67 and 0.69, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: HALT was highly prevalent, though it was subclinical. Early follow-up showed uneventful valvular hemodynamics and clinical outcomes. However, the HALT group exhibited suboptimal right ventricular function during CT scans, with older age and higher BMI linked to this issue.","['Wenhao Zhu', 'Zhiyuan Xia', 'Jiaxin Xie', 'Junyi Wan', 'Zhihui Hou', 'Liang Xu', 'Haiyue Xie', 'Yihang Li', 'Jingnan Zhang', 'Yu Han', 'Xiangbin Pan', 'Gary Tse', 'Jeffrey Shi Kai Chan', 'Fang Fang', 'Gejun Zhang']",The Canadian journal of cardiology,2025-04-29,10.1016/j.cjca.2025.04.021,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2025.04.021,,Paid,Heart Function Valvular Hemodynamics and Early term Outcomes of Possible Thrombosis in Self Expanding Transcatheter Pulmonary Valve ZHU 2025,Not available,"['Transcatheter Pulmonary Valve', 'Self-Expanding Transcatheter Pulmonary', 'Transcatheter Pulmonary', 'Pulmonary Valve', 'Valvular Hemodynamics', 'HALT', 'pulmonary valve replacement', 'Heart Function', 'Self-Expanding Transcatheter', 'Hemodynamics']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Computed tomography', 'Congenital heart disease', 'Thrombosis', 'Transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement']"
40308273,Transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement: will it prevail?,"Severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is a prevalent and challenging condition associated with poor survival outcomes and significant morbidity. Medical therapy alone often fails to provide adequate symptom relief, and stand-alone surgical intervention is linked to high mortality rates, making it a less favorable option unless combined with left-sided valve surgery. The advent of transcatheter tricuspid interventions has provided new therapeutic possibilities, particularly for high-risk patients who are ineligible for conventional surgery. However, many patients are still unsuited for transcatheter tricuspid repair or have only limited benefits from such procedures. In this context, Transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement (TTVR) has rapidly emerged as a promising alternative, offering the potential for more effective treatment outcomes. This review explores the latest advancements in TTVR devices, highlights key clinical findings, and discusses the challenges and limitations of this evolving strategy.

40283668,Review Article: Contemporary Transcatheter Heart Valves for TAVI in Bicuspid Aortic Anatomy.,"Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most common congenital heart disease, affecting 0.5-2% of the population and often leading to early aortic valve degeneration. While surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) remains the gold standard for treating severe bicuspid aortic stenosis (AS), transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is emerging as a viable alternative in selected BAV anatomies. Initial experiences with first-generation transcatheter heart valves (THVs) showed the feasibility of this technique, but were associated with lower device success rates and higher complications, such as paravalvular leak (PVL) and pacemaker implantation. Advancements in second- and third- generation THVs, together with better pre-procedural imaging assessment and growing operator experience, have significantly enhanced TAVI outcomes in BAV patients, with results now comparable to those seen in tricuspid aortic valves (TAVs). Proper patient selection, pre-procedural sizing, and device implantation are key to improving TAVI success in BAV. Recent registry data on contemporary THV platforms demonstrate improved procedural success, hemodynamic performance, and the safety of TAVI in BAV. However, higher rates of PVL, pacemaker implantation, and strokes remain concerns. Ongoing advancements in THV design and procedural techniques will further enhance outcomes for this challenging population. Up to the present, there are no dedicated THVs for BAV, but the latest-generation THVs offer promising results.","['Chrysavgi Simopoulou', 'Omar Oliva', 'Vincenzo Cesario', 'Nicolas Dumonteil', 'Didier Tchetche', 'Chiara De Biase']",Journal of clinical medicine,2025-04-20,10.3390/jcm14082838,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm14082838,PMC12027816,Free,Review Article Contemporary Transcatheter Heart Valves for TAVI in Bicuspid Aortic Anatomy SIMOPOULOU 2025,pdfs\Review Article Contemporary Transcatheter Heart Valves for TAVI in Bicuspid Aortic Anatomy SIMOPOULOU 2025.pdf,"['aortic valve', 'BAV', 'TAVI', 'Bicuspid aortic valve', 'Transcatheter Heart Valves', 'Bicuspid Aortic', 'Aortic', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'aortic valve implantation', 'valve']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['balloon-expandable valve (BEV)', 'bicuspid aortic valve (BAV)', 'paravalvular leak (PVL)', 'permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI)', 'self-expanding valve (SEV)', 'transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI)']"

Methods: This prospective study enrolled 81 patients with severe ricuspid regurgitation (≥3+) who underwent TTVR with the LuX-Valve Plus system at the Department of Cardiology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University between May 2022 and March 2024. Among them, 44 patients were from a compassionate-use study, and 37 were from two premarket clinical trials. Baseline clinical data, preprocedural imaging, procedural outcomes, and postprocedural follow-up data were collected. The primary endpoint events included device success, procedural success, and 30 d composite adverse events. Results: The age of the cohort was (74.5±7.8) years, with 54 females (67%). Device success and procedural success rates were both 90% (73/81). Post-procedural tricuspid regurgitation improved, with a 6% (5/81) incidence of moderate-to-severe paravalvular leakage. The rate of permanent pacemaker implantation was 12% (10/81), of which 5% (4/81) had pre-existing indications for pacemaker implantation. Major bleeding events occurred in 10% (8/81) of patients, and the 30 d composite endpoint rate was 25% (20/81). Conclusion: TTVR using the LuX-Valve Plus system demonstrates promising feasibility for high-risk surgical patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation, effectively reducing or eliminating regurgitation with acceptable safety. However, challenges remain in reducing risks of major adverse events, including permanent pacemaker implantation and severe bleeding.

39989358,Aortic Valve Calcification Is Induced by the Loss of ALDH1A1 and Can Be Prevented by Agonists of Retinoic Acid Receptor Alpha: Preclinical Evidence for Drug Repositioning.,"BACKGROUND: To date, the only effective treatment of severe aortic stenosis is valve replacement. With the introduction of transcatheter aortic valve replacement and extending indications to younger patients, the use of bioprosthetic valves (BPVs) has considerably increased. The main inconvenience of BPVs is their limited durability because of mechanisms similar as the fibro-calcifying processes observed in native aortic stenosis. One of the major gaps of the field is to identify therapeutic targets to prevent or slow the fibro-calcifying process leading to severe and symptomatic aortic stenosis.
METHODS: Explanted valves were collected from patients and organ donor hearts. A comparative transcriptomic analysis was performed on valvular interstitial cells (VIC) obtained from calcified (bicuspid and tricuspid) versus control valves. The mechanisms and consequences of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member A1 (ALDH1A1) downregulation were analyzed in VIC cultures from control human aortic valves. ALDH1A1 was inhibited or silenced and its impact on osteogenic marker expression and calcification processes assessed in VIC. The effect of all-trans retinoic acid on calcification was tested on human VIC cultures and on 2 animal models: the model of subcutaneous implantation of bovine pericardium in rats and the model of xenograft aortic valve replacement in juvenile sheep.
RESULTS: Transcriptome analysis of human VIC identified ALDH1A1 as the most downregulated gene in VIC from calcified versus control valves. In human VIC, ALDH1A1 expression is downregulated by TGF-β in a SMAD2/3-dependent manner. ALDH1A1 inhibition promotes an osteoblast-like VIC phenotype and increases calcium deposition through inhibition of retinoic acid receptor alpha signaling. Conversely, VIC treatment with retinoids decreases calcium deposition and attenuates VIC osteoblast activity. Last, all-trans retinoic acid inhibits calcification development of aortic BPV in both in vivo models and improves aortic valve echocardiographic parameters in the xenograft sheep model.
CONCLUSIONS: These results show that ALDH1A1 is downregulated in calcified valves, hence promoting VIC transition into an osteoblastic phenotype. Retinoic acid receptor alpha agonists, including all-trans retinoic acid through a drug repositioning strategy, represent a promising and innovative pharmacological approach to prevent calcification of native aortic valves and BPV.","['Mickael Rosa', 'Annabelle Dupont', 'David M Smadja', 'Jérôme Soquet', 'Johan Abdoul', 'Thibault Pamart', 'Flavien Vincent', 'Christina Le Tanno', 'Eloise Borowczak', 'Timothée Bigot', 'Alexandre Ung', 'Bertrand Vaast', 'Mélanie Daniel', 'Ramadan Jashari', 'Frédéric Mouquet', 'Cedric Delhaye', 'Yoann Sottejeau', 'Jeanne Rancic', 'Delphine Corseaux', 'Francis Juthier', 'Bart Staels', 'Sophie Susen', 'Eric Van Belle']",Circulation,2025-05-06,10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.124.071954,https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.124.071954,,Paid,Aortic Valve Calcification Is Induced by the Loss of ALDH1A1 and Can Be Prevented by Agonists of Retinoic Acid Receptor Alpha Preclinical Evidence for Drug Repositioning ROSA 2025,Not available,"['Preclinical Evidence', 'VIC', 'Retinoic Acid', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor', 'Aortic', 'Aortic Valve', 'aortic valve replacement', 'Acid Receptor Alpha', 'all-trans retinoic acid', 'human VIC']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['ALDH1A1', 'aortic valve stenosis', 'bioprosthetic valves', 'calcification', 'retinoids', 'valvular interstitial cells']"
39971704,Impact of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation on Right Ventricular Function.,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence and predictors of right ventricular (RV) dysfunction before and after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) are not known. We aimed to document this and sought to identify specific RV echo thresholds, below which RV improvement was unlikely to occur.
METHOD: Consecutive patients who underwent TAVI between 2017 and 2021 at Macquarie University Hospital (MUH) were included if ≥2 RV functional parameters were available on baseline echo; tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, tissue Doppler (S') and/or RV fractional area change. Prevalence and predictors of baseline RV dysfunction were documented. Patients with a repeat echo performed at MUH at 1-3 months post-TAVI were included in further analyses to assess serial changes in RV function.
RESULTS: Overall, 343 patients had an eligible baseline echo and 97 of these patients (28.2%) had RV dysfunction, pre-TAVI. These patients had significantly higher rates of atrial fibrillation, ischaemic heart disease, and chronic lung disease, than those without (p<0.05 for all). Of 239 patients with 1-3 month follow-up echo data, 66 of these had had baseline RV dysfunction; of these, 20 (30.3%) patients showed improvement and 46 (69.7%) patients showed persistent RV dysfunction. Thresholds with a greater than 90% predictive value for persistent RV dysfunction were identified for each baseline RV functional parameter: tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion <1.4 cm, S'<6, fractional area change <25%.
CONCLUSIONS: Baseline RV dysfunction was present in over a quarter of pre-TAVI patients and persisted at short-term follow-up in over two-thirds of such patients. There were clear thresholds to identify patients where RV recovery was unlikely, after TAVI.","['Seshika Ratwatte', 'Bianca Coelho', 'Martin K Ng', 'David S Celermajer']","Heart, lung & circulation",2025-05-12,10.1016/j.hlc.2024.11.017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hlc.2024.11.017,,Paid,Impact of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation on Right Ventricular Function RATWATTE 2025,Not available,"['Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Aortic Valve Implantation', 'Aortic Valve', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'Valve Implantation', 'patients', 'Macquarie University Hospital', 'dysfunction', 'Ventricular Function', 'baseline']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Aortic stenosis', 'Right ventricular dysfunction', 'Transcatheter aortic valve implantation']"
39945978,Tricuspid regurgitation after heart transplantation: where innovation and intervention are in hibernation.,"Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is a common valvular dysfunction following heart transplantation (HT), with reported prevalence rates ranging from 19 to 84%, primarily depending on the duration of follow-up. Its etiology is multifactorial and includes surgical technique, ischemic time, primary graft dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, pacemaker leads, and endomyocardial biopsies. Severe TR can significantly impair graft function, exercise capacity, and patient survival. This mini-review explores current management strategies, including surgical techniques such as annuloplasty and tricuspid valve replacement. HT patients are often high-risk surgical candidates due to factors such as immunosuppressive therapy, prior surgeries, and various comorbidities. Therefore, we primarily focus on the evidence regarding emerging interventional methods, such as transcatheter edge-to-edge repair. Although these interventions show promising early results, they remain relatively novel in HT recipients, and the current evidence is based on case reports and small studies. Further research is essential to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of these management strategies to enhance outcomes for HT recipients with TR.","['Emyal Alyaydin', 'Alexander Gotschy', 'Danaë Parianos', 'Matthias P Nägele', 'Igor Tudorache', 'Andreas J Flammer', 'Julia Stehli']",Heart failure reviews,2025-05-12,10.1007/s10741-025-10494-2,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10741-025-10494-2,PMC11991953,Free,Tricuspid regurgitation after heart transplantation where innovation and intervention are in hibernation ALYAYDIN 2025,pdfs\Tricuspid regurgitation after heart transplantation where innovation and intervention are in hibernation ALYAYDIN 2025.pdf,"['heart', 'heart transplantation', 'University Hospital Zurich', 'Tricuspid regurgitation', 'donor heart', 'Tricuspid', 'Zurich', 'Heart Failure Reviews', 'surgical technique', 'pulmonary']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Heart transplantation', 'Heart valve prosthesis implantation', 'Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair', 'Tricuspid regurgitation']"
39903642,The reversibility of cardiac damage after transcatheter aortic valve implantation and short-term outcomes in a real-world setting.,"AIMS: This study aims to assess the changes in cardiac damage stage in a real-world cohort of patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), and to investigate the prognostic value of cardiac damage stage evolution.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing TAVI were retrospectively analysed. A five-stage system based on the presence and extent of cardiac damage assessed by echocardiography was applied before and 6 months after TAVI. Multivariable Cox regression analyses were used to examine independent prognostic value of the changes in cardiac damage after TAVI. A total of 734 patients with severe AS (mean age, 79.8 ± 7.4 years; 55% male) were included. Before TAVI, 32 (4%) patients did not show any sign of extra-valvular cardiac damage (Stage 0), 85 (12%) had left ventricular damage (Stage 1), 220 (30%) left atrial and/or mitral valve damage (Stage 2), 227 (31%) pulmonary vasculature and/or tricuspid valve damage (Stage 3), and 170 (23%) right ventricular damage (Stage 4). Six months after TAVI, 39% of the patients improved at least one stage in cardiac damage. Staging of cardiac damage at 6 months after TAVI [hazard ratio (HR) per one-stage increase, 1.391; P = 0.035] as well as worsening in the stage of cardiac damage (HR, 3.729; P = 0.005) were independently associated with 2-year all-cause mortality.
CONCLUSION: More than one-third of patients with severe AS showed an improvement in cardiac damage 6 months after TAVI. Staging cardiac damage at baseline and follow-up may improve risk stratification in patients undergoing TAVI.","['Rinchyenkhand Myagmardorj', 'Federico Fortuni', 'Philippe Généreux', 'Takeru Nabeta', 'Jan Stassen', 'Xavier Galloo', 'Maria Chiara Meucci', 'Steele Butcher', 'Frank van der Kley', 'David J Cohen', 'Marie-Annick Clavel', 'Philippe Pibarot', 'Martin B Leon', 'Madelien V Regeer', 'Victoria Delgado', 'Nina Ajmone Marsan', 'Jeroen J Bax']",European heart journal.

39855450,Outcomes and Predictors of Different Flow-Gradient Patterns of Aortic Stenosis After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.,"This study sought to explore the clinical factors associated with classical low-flow low-gradient (C-LFLG) and normal-flow low-gradient (NFLG) aortic stenosis (AS) compared with high-gradient (HG) AS. We also compared clinical and echocardiographic outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) across flow-gradient patterns. Patients with C-LFLG AS have a higher mortality rate after TAVR than those with HG AS. However, what leads to C-LFLG AS and the predictors of mortality in this population remain unclear. In this retrospective, single-center study involving 1,415 patients with severe AS, patients were classified as having (1) HG AS (aortic valve mean gradient [MG] >40 mm Hg), (2) C-LFLG AS (MG <40 mm Hg, stroke volume index <35 ml/m2, left ventricular ejection fraction <50%), and (3) NFLG AS (MG <40 mm Hg, stroke volume index ≥35 ml/m2, left ventricular ejection fraction ≥50%). Logistic regression was used for predictors of C-LFLG AS. Cox regression was used for predictors of mortality in the C-LFLG AS population. Male gender, multiple co-morbidities, and moderate to severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation correlated with the C-LFLG AS group. Patients with C-LFLG AS had a higher mortality risk compared with patients with HG AS at 2 years after TAVR. Patients with NFLG AS had similar mortality at 1 year, but higher mortality at 2 years after TAVR compared with patients with HG AS. End-stage renal disease, atrial fibrillation, and other co-morbidities were predictors of 2-year mortality in patients with C-LFLG AS. In conclusion, the mortality rate after TAVR was higher among patients with C-LFLG AS than those with HG AS. Male gender and multiple co-morbidities were predictors of C-LFLG AS. Multiple co-morbidities were predictors of mortality among those patients.","['Besir Besir', 'Shivabalan Kathavarayan Ramu', 'Maryam Muhammad Ali Majeed-Saidan', 'Judah Rajendran', 'Odette Iskandar', 'Grant Reed', 'Rishi Puri', 'James Yun', 'Serge Harb', 'Rhonda Miyasaka', 'Amar Krishnaswamy', 'Zoran Popovic', 'Samir R Kapadia']",The American journal of cardiology,2025-05-01,10.1016/j.amjcard.2025.01.019,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjcard.2025.01.019,,Paid,Outcomes and Predictors of Different Flow Gradient Patterns of Aortic Stenosis After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement BESIR 2025,Not available,"['Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Aortic Stenosis', 'Aortic Valve', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'C-LFLG', 'Valve Replacement', 'Aortic', 'Patients', 'mortality']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['aortic stenosis', 'classical low-flow low-gradient (C-LFLG) AS', 'high-gradient (HG) AS', 'normal-flow low-gradient (NFLG) AS', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR)']"
40353875,Evidence of bioprosthetic valve dysfunction during three-year follow-up following TAVR.,"OBJECTIVE: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has increased significantly in younger patients and patients at lower surgical risk. In this retrospective multicenter study, we aimed to assess for bioprosthetic valve dysfunction (BVD) during three-year follow-up (FU) and potential differences between self-expandable (SEV) and balloon-expandable valves (BEV) under real-world conditions.
METHODS: Endpoints were defined according to VARC-3 criteria, including VARC composite endpoints during three-year FU.
RESULTS: A total of 1233 patients with tricuspid aortic valve stenosis, who underwent TAVR with contemporary transcatheter heart valve (THV) devices from three different tertiary care centers were included. One-fifth of the study population showed BVD at three-year FU (BVD[-]: n = 957;77.6%; BVD[+]: n = 276;22.4%). Non-structural valve deterioration (NSVD) was the most represented category (8.5%) followed by structural valve deterioration (SVD, 5.3%). BVD was more common in association with BEV as compared with SEV (60.9% vs 39.1%; p < 0.001) owing to higher rates of SVD (13.5% vs 9.5%; p = 0.028) and NSVD (17.9% vs. 13.8%; p = 0.048). Subclinical leaflet thrombosis was only documented in BEV (1.7%, p < 0.001). At three years, all-cause mortality was higher in BVD+ patients (BVD[-] vs. BVD[+]: 13.2% vs. 22.5%; HR: 1.99; 95%-CI: 1.39-2.85; p < 0.001*) but did not differ between THV platform.
CONCLUSION: BVD after TAVR is common and associated with higher all-cause mortality. Despite a preponderance of BVD in association with balloon-expandable valves, mortality rates remain similar between THV platforms.

40353871,Predictive performance of the TRI-SCORE in patients with severe aortic stenosis and concomitant tricuspid regurgitation undergoing TAVR.,"BACKGROUND: Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is a common comorbidity in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and represents a significant predictor of adverse outcomes. Precise risk stratification through clinical scoring systems is vital for tailoring treatment decisions in this patient population.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the applicability of the TRI-SCORE for predicting adverse outcomes in patients with AS and concomitant moderate-to-severe TR undergoing TAVR and to compare its performance with established surgical risk scores like the EuroSCORE II and Society of Thoracic Surgeons score (STS-Score).
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 301 patients with severe AS and concomitant TR who underwent TAVR between 2013 and 2022 at the Heart Center Bonn. According to the TRI-SCORE, patients were stratified into a low or intermediate-risk group (TRI-SCORE 0-5) and a high-risk group (TRI-SCORE 6-12). The primary endpoint was 2-year all-cause mortality. Predictive values of the TRI-SCORE were compared to the EuroSCORE II and the STS-Score for both 30-day and 2-year mortality outcomes.
RESULTS: The 2-year mortality rate was significantly higher in the high-risk group compared to the low or intermediate-risk group (TRI-SCORE 6-12: 40.0% vs. TRI-SCORE 0-5: 17.9%; p < 0.001). For predicting 30-day mortality, the EuroSCORE II and the STS-Score demonstrated superior predictive values, with AUCs of 78.4% and 83.0%, respectively, in comparison to the TRI-SCORE, which showed an AUC of 70.0%. Conversely, the TRI-SCORE allowed a better risk prediction with regard to 2-year all-cause mortality, achieving an AUC of 69.7%, superior to the EuroSCORE II (60.6%) and the STS-Score (62.1%).
CONCLUSION: The TRI-SCORE is effective in predicting mid-term mortality in patients with AS and moderate-to-severe TR undergoing TAVR, demonstrating greater robustness than the EuroSCORE II and the STS-Score for this timeframe.","['Mustafa Mousa Basha', 'Baravan Al-Kassou', 'Christopher Gestrich', 'Marcel Weber', 'Thomas Beiert', 'Sebastian Zimmer', 'Farhad Bakhtiary', 'Georg Nickenig', 'Jasmin Shamekhi']",Clinical research in cardiology : official journal of the German Cardiac Society,2025-05-12,10.1007/s00392-025-02671-y,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00392-025-02671-y,PMC5698373,Free,Predictive performance of the TRI SCORE in patients with severe aortic stenosis and concomitant tricuspid regurgitation undergoing TAVR BASHA 2025,pdfs\Predictive performance of the TRI SCORE in patients with severe aortic stenosis and concomitant tricuspid regurgitation undergoing TAVR BASH.pdf,"['patients', 'patients undergoing TAVI', 'TAVI', 'TRV', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'aortic valve', 'mortality', 'aortic valve implantation', 'all-cause mortality', 'undergoing TAVR']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Aortic valve stenosis', 'EuroSCORE II', 'STS-Score', 'TRI-SCORE', 'Transcatheter aortic valve replacement', 'Tricuspid regurgitation']"
40352131,Early Changes in Left Ventricular Myocardial Mechanics After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement for Severe Aortic Stenosis.,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) improves left ventricular (LV) deformation by aortic stenosis (AS). However, the early effects of TAVR on LV mechanics as assessed by echocardiography have not been fully elucidated.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Between 2021 and 2024, we included 81 patients who underwent transfemoral TAVR for severe AS. We used the natural logarithm of B-type natriuretic peptide (lnBNP) 1 week after TAVR as an indicator of the early effects on LV mechanics. To determine the association with echocardiographic parameters (LV ejection fraction [LVEF], global longitudinal strain [GLS], E/e', and Tei index) and postprocedural lnBNP, we used regression models while adjusting for covariates. There were no significant differences in LVEF, GLS or E/e' between before and after TAVR, but the postprocedural Tei index was significantly higher than the preprocedural Tei index (0.40 vs. 0.26, P<0.01). In a univariate linear regression, the preprocedural LVEF (β=-0.28, P=0.01), GLS (β=-0.24, P=0.04), E/e' (β=0.36, P<0.01), and Tei index (β=0.27, P=0.02) correlated with postprocedural lnBNP. Regarding the postprocedural parameters, GLS (β=-0.27, P=0.02) and E/e' (β=0.36, P<0.01) also correlated with postprocedural lnBNP, but the LVEF and Tei index did not. After adjustment for covariates, these correlations remained significant.
CONCLUSIONS: Preprocedural echocardiographic parameters reflecting LV function correlated with BNP after TAVR, but the utility of postprocedural parameters may depend on preprocedural LV function or perioperative factors.","['Takeru Ikenaga', 'Yuta Kato', 'Yuto Kawahira', 'Midori Miyazaki', 'Tetsuo Hirata', 'Hiromitsu Teratani', 'Go Kuwahara', 'Makoto Sugihara', 'Hideichi Wada', 'Masahiro Ogawa', 'Shin-Ichiro Miura']",Circulation reports,2025-05-09,10.1253/circrep.CR-24-0139,https://doi.org/10.1253/circrep.CR-24-0139,PMC12061501,Free,Early Changes in Left Ventricular Myocardial Mechanics After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement for Severe Aortic Stenosis IKENAGA 2025,pdfs\Early Changes in Left Ventricular Myocardial Mechanics After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement for Severe Aortic Stenosis IKENAGA 2025..pdf,"['Tei index', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'TAVR', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Tei', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'Severe Aortic Stenosis', 'postprocedural Tei index', 'preprocedural Tei index', 'Aortic Valve']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Aortic stenosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Tei index', 'Transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"
40351685,Age Differences in Aortic Stenosis.,"Aortic stenosis (AS) is a significant and growing concern, with a prevalence of 2-3% in individuals aged over 65 years. Moreover, with an aging global population, the prevalence is anticipated to double by 2050. Indeed, AS can arise from various etiologies, including calcific trileaflets, congenital valve abnormalities (e.g., bicuspid and unicuspid valves), and post-rheumatic, whereby each has a distinct influence that shapes the onset and progression of the disease. The normal aortic valve has a trilaminar structure comprising the fibrosa, spongiosa, and ventricularis, which work together to maintain its function. In calcific AS, the disease begins with early calcification starting in high mechanical stress areas of the valve and progresses slowly over decades, eventually leading to extensive calcification resulting in impaired valve function. This process involves mechanisms similar to atherosclerosis, including lipid deposition, chronic inflammation, and mineralization. The progression of calcific AS is strongly associated with aging, with additional risk factors including male gender, smoking, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome exacerbating the condition. Conversely, congenital forms of AS, such as bicuspid and unicuspid aortic valves, result in an earlier disease onset, typically 10-20 years earlier than that observed in patients with a normal tricuspid aortic valve. Rheumatic AS, although less common in developed countries due to effective antibiotic treatments, also exhibits age-related characteristics, with an earlier onset in individuals who experienced rheumatic fever in their youth. The only curative therapies currently available are surgical and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). However, these options are sometimes too invasive for older patients; thus, management of AS, particularly in older patients, requires a comprehensive approach that considers age, disease severity, comorbidities, frailty, and each patient's individual needs. Although the valves used in TAVR demonstrate promising midterm durability, long-term data are still required, especially when used in younger individuals, usually with low surgical risk. Moreover, understanding the causes and mechanisms of structural valve deterioration is crucial for appropriate treatment selections, including valve selection and pharmacological therapy, since this knowledge is essential for optimizing the lifelong management of AS.","['Tomoyo Hamana', 'Teruo Sekimoto', 'Aloke V Finn', 'Renu Virmani']",Reviews in cardiovascular medicine,2025-04-12,10.31083/RCM28185,https://doi.org/10.31083/RCM28185,PMC12059746,Free,Age Differences in Aortic Stenosis HAMANA 2025,pdfs\Age Differences in Aortic Stenosis HAMANA 2025.pdf,"['aortic valve', 'Aortic', 'normal aortic valve', 'valve', 'Aortic Stenosis', 'tricuspid aortic valve', 'aortic valve disease', 'normal tricuspid aortic', 'calcific aortic valve', 'aortic valve leaflets']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['aortic stenosis', 'bioprosthetic valve failure', 'calcific aortic valve disease']"

Motivated by in vitro fracture experiments and the first successful clinical implantation of a transcatheter valve (TAVR) into the remaining ring in aortic position, this approach was considered for the mitral position for the first time.
CASE SUMMARY: A 31-year-old female patient with a history of four open-heart surgeries and severe neurologic complications presented with cardiac decompensation due to a fixed tilt of her mechanical bileaflet mitral valve prosthesis, resulting in mitral stenosis with a mean gradient of above 10 mmHg. An interventional approach was discussed. Using an apical access, the tilts were cracked under cerebral protection, and a balloon-implantable TAVR was implanted uneventfully. More than 3 years later, the patient is clinically stable, the valvular function is not impaired and the embolized fragment does not cause any problems in the distal abdominal aorta.
DISCUSSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report that demonstrates the possibility to implant a biological TAVR in a failed bileaflet mechanical mitral valve after fracturing the carbon tilts.","['Christian Butter', 'Michael Neuss', 'Tanja Kücken', 'Doreen Bensch', 'Michael Erb']",European heart journal.

40349944,Explantation of Transcatheter Aortic Bioprostheses in a Very High-Risk Population.,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement explantation is associated with excessive rates of mortality. We describe a high-risk cohort of patients who underwent surgical explant with excellent outcomes at our institution.
METHODS: This is a single center, retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent surgical removal of a transcatheter bioprosthesis between January 2015 and April 2023. Clinical and operative characteristics were reviewed by direct chart review and survival was estimated.
RESULTS: Thirty-three patients underwent device explantation. Mean age was 75 ± 5.9 years. STS-PROM was 7.34 at surgical explant. Eighteen patients (55%) had previous cardiac surgery, with 15 secondary and 3 tertiary sternotomoies. Fourteen patients had prior ViV TAVR. Indications for explantation were prosthetic valve degeneration (46%), endocarditis (33%), paravalvular leak (15%), and ventricular septal defect (6%). Median TAVR valve age was 815 days. Twenty-two patients required a concomitant operation including: mitral valve replacement (21%), aortic operation (9%), coronary bypass grafting (18%), myectomy (6%), and atrial or ventricular septal defect repair (12%). None required aortic root replacement. Mean hospital length of stay was 10 ± 8 days. Postoperative complications included new renal failure (6%), respiratory failure (12%), pacemaker implantation (3%), and reentry for bleeding (3%). No patient suffered a stroke. Thirty-day, 1-year, and 3-year mortality rates were 6%, 18.6%, and 38.4%.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that acceptable outcomes are attainable in a high-risk patient cohort undergoing TAVR explant.

40348949,Risk factors and predictive models for post-operative moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation following transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a machine learning approach.,"BACKGROUND: Post-operative moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation (MR) following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is associated with poor outcomes, yet the factors contributing to this complication are not well understood. This study aimed to identify risk factors and develop predictive models for post-operative MR following TAVR using machine learning (ML) techniques to enhance early detection and intervention.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from patients who underwent TAVR at our center between August 2014 and August 2023. Patients were classified into post-operative and nonpost-operative MR groups based on postprocedural MR severity. Various ML models were evaluated for predictive performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) values were used to interpret predictive patterns and develop a clinically relevant model.
RESULTS: Among the evaluated models, the random forest model exhibited the highest predictive performance for post-operative moderate-to-severe MR after TAVR. Key predictors, which were confirmed by the SHAP analysis as important in the predictive framework, included echocardiographic parameters, blood test results, patient age, and body mass index.
CONCLUSIONS: ML models show promise in predicting post-operative moderate-to-severe MR after TAVR by integrating clinical indicators to enhance predictive accuracy.

This study aimed to compare the safety and efficacy of TAVR in these patient groups.
METHODS: Using data from the Chinese Cardiovascular Association Database-National Transcatheter Valve Therapeutics Registry, we analysed 870 propensity score matched pairs of patients with severe calcification (≥470 mm³) undergoing TAVR between April 2014 and August 2023. Primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 1 year.
RESULTS: No significant differences were observed in technical success (95.1% vs 94.7%), procedural complications or in-hospital outcomes. All-cause mortality at 1 year was similar between bicuspid and tricuspid AS (4.3% vs 5.3%, HR 0.87; log-rank p=0.62). The incidence of stroke (1.5% vs 1.4%), cardiovascular hospitalisation (1.4% vs 1.7%) and moderate-to-severe paravalvular leak (3.5% vs 2.5%) was similar during follow-up. The rate of new permanent pacemaker implantation was higher in bicuspid AS (8.4% vs 5.6%; p=0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: TAVR was observed to be equally safe and effective in bicuspid and tricuspid AS with severe calcification, though bicuspid AS was associated with a higher rate of permanent pacemaker implantation.","['Yinghao Sun', 'Changjin Wang', 'Jie Li', 'Songyuan Luo', 'Shengneng Zheng', 'Bangyuan Yang', 'Jiaohua Chen', 'Ruixin Fan', 'Jianfang Luo']",Heart (British Cardiac Society),2025-05-10,10.1136/heartjnl-2024-324697,https://doi.org/10.1136/heartjnl-2024-324697,,Paid,Outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement in bicuspid versus tricuspid aortic stenosis with severe calcification SUN 2025,Not available,"['transcatheter aortic valve', 'aortic valve replacement', 'versus tricuspid aortic', 'tricuspid aortic stenosis', 'Transcatheter Valve Therapeutics', 'severe calcification', 'transcatheter aortic', 'aortic valve', 'Valve Therapeutics Registry', 'aortic stenosis']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Aortic stenosis', 'Bicuspid aortic valve', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement']"
40348411,"Incidence, predictors and clinical impact of upper gastrointestinal bleeding after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.","BACKGROUND: Upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is common in patients with aortic stenosis due to the combination of acquired type 2A von Willebrand disease and aspirin-based antiplatelet therapy. We aimed to investigate the incidence, predictors and clinical outcomes of late upper GI bleeding in patients undergoing TAVR.
METHODS: In a prospective TAVR registry, patients were stratified according to upper GI bleeding within 1 year of discharge.
RESULTS: Among the 3144 eligible patients, 54 (1.7%) experienced upper GI bleeding after discharge. Of these, 40 patients had major or life-threatening bleeding, while 14 had minor bleeding events. The presence of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter (HRadjusted 2.98; 95% CI 1.65 to 5.38) and previous upper GI bleeding (HRadjusted 3.51; 95% CI 1.51 to 8.19) were independent predictors of upper GI bleeding, while the use of proton pump inhibitors at discharge (HRadjusted 0.49; 95% CI 0.27 to 0.89) and higher haemoglobin levels (1 g/dL increase) (HRadjusted 0.73; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.87) were protective. Patients who experienced major or life-threatening upper GI bleeding had a higher all-cause (73.7% vs 11.4%, HR 5.84; 95% CI 3.41 to 10.02) and cardiovascular mortality (31.6% vs 7.3%, HR 3.87; 95% CI 1.72 to 8.70) compared with those without upper GI bleeding.
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients who underwent TAVR, 1.7% of patients experienced upper GI bleeding within 1 year of discharge. Major or life-threatening upper GI bleeding was associated with an increased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.

PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases were searched until November 2024 for studies reporting PPI incidence within 30 days post-TAVR. A random-effect model was used to pool risk ratios (RR) and standardized mean differences (SDM) for binary and continuous risk factors. Network meta-analysis estimated pooled risk differences (ΔRR) for binary predictors with male sex as the reference. Significant predictors were ranked based on their surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) values. A total of 108 studies comprising 77,538 patients (14,560 requiring PPI) were included. Male sex (RR: 1.13), baseline atrial fibrillation (AF) (RR: 1.12), 2nd degree Mobitz I (RR: 5.16) and Mobitz II (RR: 2.30) atrioventricular blocks (AVB), 3rd degree AVB (RR: 13.46), left anterior (LAHB) (RR: 1.79) and posterior hemiblocks (LPHB) (RR: 2.57), bifascicular block (RR: 2.34), right bundle branch block (RBBB) (RR: 3.20) and intraprocedural AVB (RR: 4.15) were identified as predictors for PPI post-TAVR. The risk of PPI was higher with self-expandable valves (RR: 1.79), subclavian access (RR: 1.75), and 29 mm prostheses (RR: 1.33) compared to balloon-expandable valves, transfemoral access, and 23 mm prostheses. Network meta-analysis ranked 3rd degree AVB (SUCRA <0.01), Mobitz I AVB (SUCRA: 0.14), Mobitz II AVB (SUCRA: 0.33), intraprocedural AVB (SUCRA: 0.42), bifascicular block (SUCRA: 0.48), RBBB (SUCRA: 0.49) and LPHB (SUCRA: 0.54) as major predictors of PPI in descending order of significance. In conclusion, clinicians should closely monitor conduction abnormalities as key predictors of PPI following TAVR.

40348045,Impact of Annulus Size on Bioprosthetic Valve Failure after Self-Expanding Transcatheter Heart Valves Replacement.,"There is limited evidence on the prognosis and long-term valve durability after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in patients with small aortic annulus (SAA) and large aortic annulus (LAA). This analysis was sought to evaluate the impact of annular size differences on patients' and valve outcomes. A total of 1,211 patients undergoing TAVR using self-expandable transcatheter heart valve (SE-THV) were retrospectively analyzed. The cut-off for SAA was defined as annulus perimeter of < 72 mm. The primary endpoints were all-cause mortality and bioprosthetic valve failure (BVF) between the SAA and LAA groups. As a sub-analysis, the impact of post-procedural mean pressure gradient (mPG) ≥ 20mmHg and severe prosthesis-patient mismatch (PPM) on these outcomes were also evaluated. Of all patients, 60.1% (n=723) had SAA. At 7 years after TAVR, the SAA group had lower incidence of all-cause mortality (53.7% vs. 63.7%, log-rank p=0.05) and lower event rate of BVF than LAA (1.2% vs. 4.6%, p=0.01 for Gray's test). Multivariate Cox-regression and Fine-Gray competing risk regression analysis demonstrated the presence of SAA was related to better prognosis (Hazard ratio [HR]: 0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.67 to 0.98) and lower BVF (adjusted subdistribution HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.98). There were no impact of post-procedural mPG ≥ 20 mmHg or severe PPM on the difference of mortality and BVF. Further, these results were consistent in the patients with SAAs.

OBJECTIVES: This study sought to investigate the 1-year outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement using the intra-annular NAV and the ULTRA THVs.
METHODS: The NAVULTRA (Navitor and SAPIEN 3 Ultra) registry included consecutive patients who underwent transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement at 16 centers with NAV or ULTRA between November 2018 and April 2024. Propensity score matching was used for adjustment. The primary outcomes of interest were all-cause death and the composite of all-cause death, disabling stroke, and hospitalization for heart failure at 1 year.
RESULTS: The overall study cohort included 3,878 patients treated with NAV (n = 1,746) or ULTRA (n = 2,176). The propensity score-matched population resulted in 1,363 pairs. At 1 year, the rate of death from any cause was 9.7% with NAV and 9.9% with ULTRA (adjusted P = 0.585). Similarly, there were no significant differences in primary composite outcome (13.6% in the NAV group and 12.6% in the ULTRA group; adjusted P = 0.218). The rate of new permanent pacemaker implantation (20.6% vs 10.6%; adjusted P < 0.01) and heart failure rehospitalization (4.6% vs 2.8%; adjusted P < 0.05) was higher in NAV group. At 1 year, the use of NAV was associated with higher rates of mild paravalvular leak (OR: 1.53; 95% CI: 1.01 to 2.33; adjusted P < 0.05) but lower mean transprosthetic gradients compared with ULTRA (mean change:-3.90, 95% CI: -4.47 to -3.34; adjusted P < 0.01).

40345873,Immediate transcatheter aortic valve replacement versus temporizing balloon aortic valvuloplasty in severe aortic stenosis: A systematic review and meta-analysis immediate TAVR vs. temporizing BAV.,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a first-line therapy for severe aortic stenosis (AS). In patients with contraindications to immediate TAVR, temporizing balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) may be performed to stabilize patients prior to TAVR. The relative efficacy and safety of TAVR with or without temporizing BAV remains inadequately described.
METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases for studies comparing TAVR with and without temporizing BAV in patients with severe AS. Random-effects models were used to calculate pooled odds, risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: Nine studies (59,205 patients: 95.7 % immediate TAVR, 4.3 % BAV + TAVR) met inclusion criteria. Mean age was 82.9 ± 6.6 years old, and 45.9 % were males. Patients in the TAVR group were a mean difference of 1 year younger with no difference in gender distribution between groups. Direct TAVR was associated with a lower risk of 30-day all-cause mortality than BAV + TAVR (RR = 0.62; 95 % CI 0.41 to 0.93; p = 0.02). There were no significant differences in risks of post-procedural pacemaker implantation, myocardial infarction, cardiac tamponade, major vascular complications, ischemic stroke, major bleeding, 2+ or greater aortic regurgitation grade or acute kidney injury.
CONCLUSION: While immediate TAVR was associated with slightly lower short-term mortality compared to BAV + TAVR in patients with severe AS, other binary endpoints were equivalent. This potential mortality difference should be considered when offering BAV + TAVR in patients with contraindications to immediate TAVR. Randomized studies are required to confirm these results.","['Mohamed Doma', 'Wilbert Huang', 'Sarai Hernandez', 'Syeda Rubab Fatima', 'Shanmukh Lingamsetty', 'Mangesh Kritya', 'Maya Hemdanieh', 'Zahra Naji', 'Douglas Mesadri Gewehr', 'Felipe Villa Martignoni', 'Andrew M Goldsweig']",Cardiovascular revascularization medicine : including molecular interventions,2025-04-29,10.1016/j.carrev.2025.04.019,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.carrev.2025.04.019,,Paid,Immediate transcatheter aortic valve replacement versus temporizing balloon aortic valvuloplasty in severe aortic stenosis A systematic review and meta analysis immediate TAVR vs temporizing BAV DOMA 2025,Not available,"['transcatheter aortic valve', 'TAVR', 'aortic valve replacement', 'severe aortic stenosis', 'temporizing balloon aortic', 'valve replacement versus', 'transcatheter aortic', 'balloon aortic valvuloplasty', 'BAV', 'temporizing BAV']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Aortic stenosis', 'Balloon aortic valvuloplasty', 'Transcatheter aortic valve implantation']"

An 80-year-old woman presenting with severe aortic stenosis was referred for TAVR. A preprocedural computed tomography revealed risk factors for CO: narrow aortic root and borderline-low coronary height. During TAVR, both coronaries were protected. After transcatheter heart valve (THV) implantation, contrast staining of the left sinus and leaflet interaction with the left main (LM) ostium were noted, prompting LM stenting to prevent obstruction. Because the THV-aorta space was virtual, we opted for rewiring and LM stenting through a THV cell. A postprocedural computed tomograohy revealed a permeable, well-expanded stent. Chimney stenting between the THV and aorta may be unfeasible in patients with a narrow aorta because of a risk of stent compression. Orthotopic chimney stenting through a THV cell may be preferable to classic chimney stenting in patients with a narrow aorta and minimal THV-aorta space.","['Ruxandra I Sava', 'Hakim Benamer', 'Julien Quillet', 'Maximilien Sochala', 'Philippe M Garot', 'Mariama Akodad']",JACC.

40345648,Balloon-Expandable versus Self-Expanding Valves in Patients With Prior Surgical Mitral Valve Replacement Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.,"BACKGROUND: Preexisting mitral prosthesis raises technical challenges for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) but has been scarcely studied. This study sought to compare outcomes of patients with previous surgical mitral valve prostheses undergoing TAVR with balloon-expandable (BEV) or self-expanding valve (SEV) systems.
METHODS: Patients from the Spanish TAVR registry with preexisting surgical mitral prostheses were included. The primary endpoints were Valve Academic Research Consortium-3 technical and device success and were analyzed according to valve type. The rates of transcatheter heart valve (THV) embolization, mitral valve impingement, THV performance and pacemaker were also assessed.
RESULTS: A total of 243 patients were included (BEV: 37%; SEV: 63%). Overall technical success was 95.9%. 30-day device success was higher in BEV patients (94.4% vs 85.0%, p=0.036), mainly driven by lower incidences of moderate residual aortic regurgitation (0% vs 5.9%, p=0.028) and THV embolization (0% vs 3.9%, p=0.087). BEV recipients exhibited higher mean transvalvular gradients (10.5 vs 8.1 mmHg, p=0.002) and lower rates of permanent pacemaker implantation (5.6% vs 15.7%, p=0.023). There were no differences in mortality, bleeding or readmission at 30 days. In multivariate analysis, a mitroaortic distance ≤7 mm and lack of transesophageal echocardiography guidance were associated with increased device failure.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with preexisting MV prostheses, TAVR was safe and effective regardless of the THV type. Nevertheless, the use of BEVs resulted in a greater rate of device success driven by lesser THV embolization and residual aortic regurgitation.","['Lluis Asmarats', 'Pilar Jiménez-Quevedo', 'Ignacio J Amat-Santos', 'María-Cruz Ferrer-Gracia', 'Fernando Sarnago', 'Juan H Alonso-Briales', 'Juan Francisco Oteo', 'Vicenç Serra', 'Guillem Muntané-Carol', 'Victoria Vilalta', 'David Del Val', 'Manuel Pan', 'José M De la Torre Hernández', 'Sergio García-Blas', 'José Luis Díez', 'Alberto Berenguer', 'Raquel Del Valle', 'Felipe Navarro Del Amo', 'Miguel Artaiz', 'Ander Regueiro', 'Manuel López-Pérez', 'Albert Massó van-Roessel', 'José G Paredes-Vázquez', 'Clara Fernández-Cordón', 'José Antonio Diarte de Miguel', 'Nicolás Maneiro', 'Alberto Piserra-López', 'Jorge de la Fuente', 'Juan Muñoz', 'Rafael Romaguera', 'Xavier Carrillo', 'Fernando Alfonso', 'Marco Alvarado', 'Gabriela Veiga', 'Xavier Millán', 'Luis Nombela-Franco', 'Dabit Arzamendi']",The Canadian journal of cardiology,2025-05-07,10.1016/j.cjca.2025.04.026,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2025.04.026,,Paid,Balloon Expandable versus Self Expanding Valves in Patients With Prior Surgical Mitral Valve Replacement Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement ASMARATS 2025,Not available,"['Prior Surgical Mitral', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Replacement Undergoing Transcatheter', 'Valve Replacement Undergoing', 'Valve Replacement', 'Mitral Valve Replacement', 'Surgical Mitral Valve', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Prior Surgical', 'Valve']",2025-05-12,Pending,[]

Secondary outcomes included minor access site complications related to the device, time to hemostasia, time to deployment, and time to total closure.
RESULTS: A total of 88 subjects were included at seven investigational centers in Europe. One device-related major access site complication (i.e., retroperitoneal hematoma) occurred (1.1%). The acute success rate of device deployment was 95%. There were five minor vascular access site complications directly related to the device (5.7%). The median time of device deployment was 5 min, the median time to achieve hemostasia was 1 min, and the median total closure time was 6 min.
CONCLUSION: The PerQseal+ closure device was safe and effective for large-bore arterial femoral closure. These results highlight its potential as a reliable alternative for large-bore closure in endovascular procedures.","['Christian Frerker', 'Arne Schwindt', 'Andrej Schmidt', 'Tobias Schmidt', 'Guillaume Bonnet', 'Daniela Branzan', 'Lionel Leroux', 'Nicolas M Van Mieghem', 'Vasileios Panoulas', 'Christopher Martin', 'Fernando Gatto']",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,2025-05-07,10.1002/ccd.31574,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.31574,,Paid,The Frontier V Study Evaluating the Safety and Clinical Performance of a Large Bore Vascular Closure Device After Femoral Arterial Access FRERKER 2025,Not available,"['Vascular Closure Device', 'Device', 'Closure Device', 'Clinical Performance', 'Evaluating the Safety', 'Closure', 'access site complications', 'vascular access site', 'Large-Bore Vascular Closure', 'access site']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['EVAR', 'TAVR', 'femoral arterial access', 'large bore arterial access', 'vascular closure device', 'vascular complications']"

40337394,Transcaval access for transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Transfemoral access is considered the standard route for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). However, in some cases, this access route is contraindicated. Alternative access routes, such as transaxillary, are emerging as first-line approaches to address these limitations, while the transcaval approach remains uncertain. Our Meta-analysis aims to evaluate the safety of the transcaval approach compared to other access routes for TAVR.
METHODS: We searched five databases, PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Embase, from inception until April 2024 for any study that reports transcaval access alone or compares it to any alternative access in TAVR patients. We used Risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and Mean Difference (MD) for continuous outcomes with a 95% confidence interval.
RESULTS: Eleven studies with 1003 patients were included, transcaval showed non-statistically significant difference over alternatives in terms of intra-hospital, 30 days, and long-term all-cause mortality with a RR of 0.08 (95% CI -0.83 to 0.99, P = 0.86), 0.11 (95% CI -0.48 to 0.7, P = 0.71), and 1.08 (95% CI -0.50 to 2.66, P = 0.18), respectively. Furthermore, in our single-arm analysis, transcaval access has a low pooled 30-day all-cause mortality rate of 7% (95% CI 5-10) and long-term mortality of 21% (95% CI 2-77). The mean difference in length of stay in the hospital after the operation was 4.88 (95% CI 4.45-5.31), and the major bleeding rate was 14% (95% CI 8-23).
CONCLUSION: Transcaval access for TAVR is a safe and feasible method that can be considered a new alternative when trans-femoral access is contraindicated.","['Zina Otmani', 'Ahmad Alzawahreh', 'Abdelaziz A Awad', 'Basma Badrawy Khalefa', 'Hazem Ayman Elsayed', 'Omar Hany Mohamed Amin', 'Mohamed Abouzid', 'Amjad Almansi', 'Ayman K Awad']",Annals of medicine and surgery (2012),2025-05-12,10.1097/MS9.0000000000003193,https://doi.org/10.1097/MS9.0000000000003193,PMC12055168,Free,Transcaval access for transcatheter aortic valve replacement a systematic review and meta analysis OTMANI 2025,pdfs\Transcaval access for transcatheter aortic valve replacement a systematic review and meta analysis OTMANI 2025.pdf,"['Transcaval access', 'access', 'Transcaval', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'aortic valve replacement', 'aortic valve', 'TAVR', 'transcatheter aortic', 'mortality', 'aortic']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['meta-analysis', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement', 'transcaval']"
40334981,Prevalence and clinical outcomes of permanent conduction disturbances after Transcatheter aortic valve replacement.,"BACKGROUND: A new-onset conduction disturbance is a major concern in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) but can resolve over time. This study aimed to evaluate the recovery in conduction disturbances post-TAVR and its association with clinical outcomes.
METHODS: This retrospective study included 780 TAVR patients at St. Marianna University between January 2016 and March 2023. Patients were stratified into four groups based on conduction status at six months post-TAVR: no conduction disturbance, recovered conduction disturbance [defined as a post-procedural pacemaker implantation with cumulative right ventricular pacing <40 % or complete left bundle branch block (CLBBB) at discharge but not at six months], permanent conduction disturbance (defined as pacemaker implantation with cumulative right ventricular pacing ≥40 % or CLBBB at both discharge and six months), and preprocedural conduction disturbance. The primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalization. The secondary outcome was the change in cardiac damage from pre-procedure to one-year post-TAVR.
RESULTS: Of 780 patients, 220 (28 %) had new-onset CLBBB or required a pacemaker implantation at discharge. Among these, 99 (45 %) had permanent conduction disturbances at six months. Over a median follow-up of 788 days, both permanent and preprocedural conduction disturbances were significantly associated with a higher incidence of heart failure hospitalization [hazard ratio (HR) 3.63; 95 % confidence interval (CI): 2.04-6.47, p < 0.01 and HR 2.50; 95 % CI: 1.27-4.90, p < 0.01), although no difference in all-cause mortality was observed. In contrast, the prognosis of patients with recovered conduction disturbance was comparable with those with no conduction disturbance. Patients with permanent and preprocedural conduction disturbances showed significant worsening cardiac damage.
CONCLUSION: Permanent and preprocedural conduction disturbances after TAVR were associated with increased heart failure hospitalizations, while the prognostic impact of recovered conduction disturbance may be limited.","['Takahiko Kai', 'Masaki Izumo', 'Masahiro Sekiguchi', 'Tetsu Tanaka', 'Taishi Okuno', 'Yukio Sato', 'Shingo Kuwata', 'Masashi Koga', 'Ikutaro Nakajima', 'Kenichi Sasaki', 'Yasuhiro Tanabe', 'Tomoo Harada', 'Yoshihiro J Akashi']",Journal of cardiology,2025-05-05,10.1016/j.jjcc.2025.04.013,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jjcc.2025.04.013,,Paid,Prevalence and clinical outcomes of permanent conduction disturbances after Transcatheter aortic valve replacement KAI 2025,Not available,"['Transcatheter aortic valve', 'aortic valve replacement', 'conduction disturbance', 'conduction', 'Transcatheter aortic', 'preprocedural conduction disturbances', 'undergoing transcatheter aortic', 'valve replacement', 'preprocedural conduction', 'recovered conduction disturbance']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Aortic stenosis', 'Conduction disturbance', 'Transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"
40328422,Outcomes of Surgical versus Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Patients with Low-Flow Low-Gradient Aortic Stenosis.,"OBJECTIVE: This study sought to determine the impact of surgical (SAVR) versus transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in patients with low-flow low-gradient (LFLG) aortic stenosis (AS).
METHODS: This was an observational study of consecutive AVRs for severe AS from 2010 to 2023. Patients with LFLG (aortic valve mean gradient <40 mmHg and a stroke volume index <35 ml/m2) were included. Both classical (ejection fraction <50%) and paradoxical (ejection fraction ≥50%) subtypes were included. Concomitant procedures and history of prior AVR were excluded. Patients were dichotomized by intervention.
RESULTS: A total of 575 patients underwent isolated, first-time AVR for LFLG AS, of which 248 (43%) were low operative risk (STS-PROM <4%). 131 (52.8%) underwent SAVR and 117 (47.2%) underwent TAVR. The TAVR patients were older than the SAVR patients: 79.0 [76.0-84.0] years vs. 66.0 [59.0-73.0] years, p<0.001. The incidence of 30-day mortality, stroke, and pacemaker were no different across each group, but the incidence of PVL was higher in the TAVR group. At 1-year follow-up, aortic valve mean gradient (9.0 [7.0-12.0] mmHg) and ejection fraction (55.0% [40.0-60.0]) were no different across each group. On multivariable analysis, TAVR was not associated with an increased hazard of death compared to SAVR (HR 1.38, 95% CI: 0.72, 2.66, p=0.34) and it was not associated with an increased hazard of heart failure readmission (HR 1.70, 95% CI: 0.88, 3.30, p=0.11), compared to SAVR.
CONCLUSIONS: For patients with LFLG AS, surgical and transcatheter approaches to AVR may be equally as advantageous with respect to long-term outcomes.","['James A Brown', 'Eishan Ashwat', 'Nav Warraich', 'Nidhi Iyanna', 'Derek Serna-Gallegos', 'Dustin Kliner', 'Catalin Toma', 'David West', 'Amber Makani', 'Irsa Hasan', 'Takuya Ogami', 'Danial Ahmad', 'Floyd Thoma', 'Yisi Wang', 'Ibrahim Sultan']",The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,2025-04-23,10.1016/j.jtcvs.2025.04.034,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcvs.2025.04.034,,Paid,Outcomes of Surgical versus Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Patients with Low Flow Low Gradient Aortic Stenosis BROWN 2025,Not available,"['Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'versus Transcatheter Aortic', 'Low-Gradient Aortic Stenosis', 'Aortic Valve', 'Aortic Stenosis', 'Surgical versus Transcatheter', 'Low-Flow Low-Gradient Aortic', 'Valve Replacement', 'Transcatheter Aortic']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['aortic stenosis', 'surgical aortic valve replacement', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"
40325824,Immediate and Early Outcomes Following Myval Octacor Transcatheter Heart Valve Implantation for the Treatment of Patients With Severe Aortic Valve Stenosis: The OCTACOR-EU Study.,"BACKGROUND: THV is a standard treatment for elderly patients with severe AS, using either BE or self-expanding (SE) THVs. While the Myval BE THV has demonstrated safety and efficacy, data on its latest iteration, the Octacor, are limited.
AIMS: To evaluate the clinical performance of the next-generation Myval Octacor balloon-expandable (BE) transcatheter heart valve (THV) in patients with severe, symptomatic native aortic valve stenosis (AS).
METHODS: This observational, real-world, multicenter study involved patients deemed suitable for TAVR and treated with Octacor BE THV at 15 European centers. The primary endpoint was the rate of technical success (exit from procedure room) per VARC-3 criteria. Secondary endpoints included overall mortality, stroke, moderate-to-severe paravalvular leak (PVL), and need for permanent pacemaker (pPM) at 30-day and the longest available follow-up. An analysis by THV sizes (standard -20 to 29 mm vs. XL sizes -30.5 and 32 mm) was performed.
RESULTS: From January to December 2023, 252 patients with severe AS underwent TAVR with the Octacor THV. The average age was 80.6 ± 6.7 years, and the mean STS score was 3.45%. Bicuspid anatomy was reported in 7.1% of cases (standard group 5.4% vs. XL group 20%, p = 0.004). Technical success was achieved in 98.8% of procedures (standard group 99.1% vs. XL group 96.7%, p = 0.2). At 30 days, overall mortality was 1.2%, stroke 3.2%, moderate-to-severe PVL 0.8%, and pPM 16.3%.
CONCLUSIONS: The novel BE Myval Octacor THV showed high technical success and favorable early clinical outcomes.

40323430,Mutational landscape and impact of clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential in severe aortic valve stenosis.,"BACKGROUND: Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) has been progressively established as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and associated with worsened outcomes in patients with aortic valve stenosis (AVS). This cohort study aimed to evaluate the mutational landscape of CHIP and its' influence on clinical outcomes.
METHODS: 194 patients with AVS undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) were sequenced using a capture panel for multiple CH driver mutations and follow up conducted for three years.
RESULTS: We found high prevalences (77.8%) of a broad spectrum of CH-driver mutations across 38 genes, with 34% of patients fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for CHIP. Evaluating the impact of CHIP driver mutations on outcomes, the presence of CHIP was associated with mortality only when adjusting for confounding factors (HR: 2.143, 95% CI: 1.029-4.461, p = 0.042), while the presence of CH driver mutations at low VAF showed no association with mortality (p = 0.377). However, when excluding DNMT3A-CHIP, we found a significant association of CHIP with mortality in univariate (p = 0.022) and multivariable (HR: 2.976, 95% CI: 1.381-6.411, p = 0.005) analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: As the first study to evaluate a broad spectrum of CH driver mutations at all variant allele frequencies in the context of aortic valve stenosis, we found CHIP to be a frequent phenomenon and CH-driver mutations to be highly prevalent in patients with severe AVS. CHIP, other than DNMT3A-CHIP, was associated with increased mortality even after successful TAVR. The presence of CH driver mutations at low allele frequencies was not associated with mortality.","['Raúl Nicolas Jamin', 'Baravan Al-Kassou', 'Theresa Kleuker', 'Jasmin Shamekhi', 'Benedikt Bartsch', 'Ansgar Ackerschott', 'Muntadher Al Zaidi', 'Hannah Billig', 'Claus Moritz Graef', 'Malte Kelm', 'Stephan Baldus', 'Georg Nickenig', 'Eicke Latz', 'Sebastian Zimmer']",Clinical research in cardiology : official journal of the German Cardiac Society,2025-05-05,10.1007/s00392-025-02658-9,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00392-025-02658-9,PMC8874362,Free,Mutational landscape and impact of clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential in severe aortic valve stenosis JAMIN 2025,pdfs\Mutational landscape and impact of clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential in severe aortic valve stenosis JAMIN 2025.pdf,"['aortic valve stenosis', 'Medicare', 'CHIP', 'clonal hematopoiesis', 'aortic valve', 'driver mutations', 'CHIP driver mutations', 'patients', 'valve stenosis', 'MDS']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Aortic valve stenosis', 'Clonal hematopoiesis', 'Transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"

40320003,Machine Learning Methods to Predicting Transvalvular Gradient Waveform Post-Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Using Pre-procedural Echocardiogram.,"OBJECTIVE: Time-varying transvalvular pressure gradient after transcatheter aortic valve replacement indicates the effectiveness of the therapy. The objective was to develop a novel machine learning method enhanced by generative artificial intelligence and smart data selection strategies to predict the post-transcatheter aortic valve replacement gradient waveform using pre-procedural Doppler echocardiogram.
METHODS: A total of 110 patients undergoing TAVR (mean age 78.2 ± 9.0 years, 52.5% female) were included for pressure gradient collection. A deep machine learning model was trained and tested to predict post-procedural pressure gradient waveform from pre-procedural pressure gradient waveform based on the proposed generative active learning framework.
RESULTS: The trained model demonstrated an average prediction accuracy of 84.85% across the 10 test patients measured from the relative mean absolute error between the predicted gradient waveform and ground truth. The generative method improved prediction accuracy by 3.11%, while the data selection strategy increased it by 16.03% compared to the baseline experimental group using plain machine learning. Additionally, Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated a strong agreement between the proposed method and clinical measurements for both mean and peak pressure gradient predictions.
CONCLUSIONS: A deep, generative, active machine learning model was developed to output the prediction of post-TAVR time-varying pressure gradient from the pre-procedural time-varying gradient obtained from Doppler echocardiogram. Such a predictive method may help guide decision-making for the prevention of various post-TAVR complications. Further studies are necessary to investigate the gradient change of other valve types.","['Wenyuan Song', 'Taylor Sirset-Becker', 'Luis René Mata Quinonez', 'Dhruv Polsani', 'Venkateshwar Polsani', 'Pradeep Yadav', 'Vinod Thourani', 'Lakshmi Prasad Dasi']",The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,2025-05-02,10.1016/j.jtcvs.2025.04.044,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcvs.2025.04.044,,Paid,Machine Learning Methods to Predicting Transvalvular Gradient Waveform Post Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Using Pre procedural Echocardiogram SONG 2025,Not available,"['Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Predicting Transvalvular Gradient', 'Post-Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Predicting Transvalvular', 'Aortic Valve', 'Valve Replacement', 'valve replacement gradient', 'Gradient Waveform', 'Transvalvular Gradient Waveform', 'pressure gradient']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Deep machine learning', 'Generative active learning', 'Generative artificial intelligence', 'Predictive surgical planning', 'Pressure gradient', 'Transcatheter aortic valve implantation/replacement']"
40317314,Impact of an improvement in the early left ventricular ejection fraction on the 1-year clinical outcomes and its predictors after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.,"PURPOSE: We evaluated the 1-year clinical outcomes (all-cause mortality, heart failure rehospitalization, and their composite) in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) and a preoperative left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 50% who underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), and examined the baseline factors predicting ≥ 10% early LVEF improvement.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 44 patients who underwent TAVR and divided them into Group R (≥ 10% LVEF improvement, n = 25) or Group N (< 10% improvement, n = 19). A Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to assess the survival rates, and multivariable logistic regression was applied to identify the predictors of LVEF improvement.
RESULTS: The mean patient age was 84.8 ± 4.8 years, and 40.9% were male. Post-TAVR, 56.8% of patients showed ≥ 10% LVEF improvement (mean increase: 16.7 ± 6.1%). The one-year mortality was similar between the groups (p = 0.383), whereas the composite endpoint tended to be higher in Group N (0.4% vs. 21.1%, p = 0.072). The peak aortic valve velocity was the only significant predictor (OR = 0.255, p = 0.048; cutoff: 4.45 m/s, sensitivity, 0.840; specificity, 0.684).
CONCLUSION: In patients with severe AS and a preoperative LVEF of < 50%, 56.8% demonstrated a significant early LVEF improvement post-TAVR.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to enhance the performance of risk assessment models in this patient population by developing a predictive model for adverse outcomes using various machine learning (ML) techniques.
METHODS: This multicenter cohort study included 326 patients diagnosed with severe AS and HFpEF who underwent TAVR between January 2017 and December 2023. Patients were allocated to training (n=195) and independent validation (n=131) sets based on hospital affiliation. A dual-phase feature selection process, combining least absolute shrinkage and selection operator logistic regression and the Boruta algorithm, was used to identify relevant variables from the multimodal dataset. A total of 5 ML model-decision trees, K-nearest neighbors, random forest, support vector machine, and extreme gradient boosting were used to construct a visualization and explainable predictive framework to elucidate model decision-making processes.
RESULTS: The primary features identified included age, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, fasting blood glucose, triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio, triglyceride glucose index, triglyceride glucose-BMI index, atherogenic index of plasma index, and Apolipoprotein B. Among the 5 models, the support vector machine demonstrated the best predictive performance for major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events in patients with severe AS and HFpEF following TAVR, achieving an area under the curve of 0.756 (95% CI 0.631-0.881) in the independent validation set. The model exhibited good calibration and robust predictive power in both training and validation sets and demonstrated the highest net benefit in decision curve analysis compared to other models. To extract significant variables influencing the algorithm and ensure model appropriateness, we interpreted cohort and personalized model predictions using Shapley Additive Explanations values.
CONCLUSIONS: Our ML-based multimodal model, incorporating 8 readily accessible predictors, demonstrated robust predictive capability for 12 months of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events risk. This model can be used to identify high-risk individuals with AS and HFpEF following TAVR, potentially aiding in risk stratification and personalized treatment strategies.","['Jun Wang', 'Jiajun Zhu', 'Hui Li', 'Shili Wu', 'Siyang Li', 'Zhuoya Yao', 'Tongjian Zhu', 'Bi Tang', 'Shengxing Tang', 'Jinjun Liu']",Journal of medical Internet research,2025-05-01,10.2196/70587,https://doi.org/10.2196/70587,,Paid,Multimodal Visualization and Explainable Machine Learning Driven Markers Enable Early Identification and Prognosis Prediction for Symptomatic Aortic Stenosis and Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Multicenter Cohort Study WANG 2025,Not available,"['Markers Enable Early', 'Enable Early Identification', 'Learning-Driven Markers Enable', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Symptomatic Aortic Stenosis', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Preserved Ejection Fraction', 'Markers Enable', 'Enable Early', 'Early Identification']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['heart failure with preserved ejection fraction', 'interpretable models', 'machine learning', 'major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events.', 'symptomatic aortic stenosis', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"
40308627,Comparative effectiveness of transcatheter vs surgical aortic valve replacement: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: The management of severe symptomatic aortic stenosis has been revolutionized by transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), offering a minimally invasive alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). However, the comparative safety and efficacy of these interventions remain subjects of ongoing investigation.
AIM: To compare the clinical outcomes and safety of TAVR vs SAVR in patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis.
METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing TAVR and SAVR were identified from databases including PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science up to May 31, 2024. Data were extracted on clinical outcomes, including mortality, procedural complications, and post-procedure adverse events. Risk ratios (RRs) with 95%CIs were calculated using a random-effects model.
RESULTS: A total of 10 RCTs were included. TAVR demonstrated a significantly lower risk of acute kidney injury (RR: 0.33; 95%CI: 0.25-0.44), major bleeding (RR: 0.37; 95%CI: 0.30-0.46), and new-onset atrial fibrillation (RR: 0.44; 95%CI: 0.34-0.57) compared to SAVR. However, TAVR was associated with higher risks of new permanent pacemaker implantation (RR: 3.49; 95%CI: 2.77-4.39), major vascular complications (RR: 2.47; 95%CI: 1.91-3.21), and paravalvular leaks (RR: 4.15; 95%CI: 3.14-5.48). Mortality at 30 days was comparable (RR: 0.95; 95%CI: 0.78-1.15), but long-term mortality was slightly higher with TAVR in some analyses (RR: 1.23; 95%CI: 1.01-1.49). Rates of stroke (RR: 0.97; 95%CI: 0.81-1.17) and myocardial infarction (RR: 0.91; 95%CI: 0.67-1.24) were similar between the groups.
CONCLUSION: TAVR offers a less invasive option with significant benefits in reducing acute kidney injury, major bleeding, and new-onset atrial fibrillation, making it particularly advantageous for high-risk surgical candidates. However, higher risks of permanent pacemaker implantation, vascular complications, and paravalvular leaks highlight the need for individualized patient selection and shared decision-making to optimize outcomes.","['Iman Moradi', 'Muhammad Saqlain Mustafa', 'Jannat Sardar Sheikh', 'Behrooz Shojai Rahnama', 'Matthew Fredericks', 'Anil Kumar Yennam', 'Mustafa Arain', 'Utsow Saha', 'Andrew Richard Ma', 'Adithya Nagendran', 'Moosa Bin Omer', 'Muhammad Armaghan', 'Diana Carolina Cortés Jaimes', 'Nagavenkata Lova Surya Vamsi Avinash Bojanki', 'Muhammad Ashir Shafique']",World journal of cardiology,2025-04-26,10.4330/wjc.v17.i4.104168,https://doi.org/10.4330/wjc.v17.i4.104168,PMC12038701,Free,Comparative effectiveness of transcatheter vs surgical aortic valve replacement A systematic review and meta analysis MORADI 2025,pdfs\Comparative effectiveness of transcatheter vs surgical aortic valve replacement A systematic review and meta analysis MORADI 2025.pdf,"['aortic valve replacement', 'Department of Medicine', 'surgical aortic valve', 'aortic valve', 'TAVR', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'aortic', 'valve replacement', 'surgical aortic', 'Muhammad Saqlain Mustafa']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Aortic stenosis', 'Meta-analysis', 'Surgical aortic valve replacement', 'Transcatheter aortic valve replacement', 'Treatment decision-making']"

40306844,Clinical Impact of Midframe Underexpansion Following TAVR Using a Self-Expanding Transcatheter Heart Valve.,"BACKGROUND: The occurrence and clinical impact of transcatheter heart valve midframe underexpansion following transcatheter aortic valve replacement are not well understood.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate midframe underexpansion among patients treated with the self-expanding ACURATE neo2 device.
METHODS: This retrospective analysis included 604 patients (median age 82 years; Q1-Q3: 78-85 years; 61.4% women) from 2 European high-volume centers. Midframe underexpansion was assessed on postimplantation fluoroscopic images and defined as nonparallelism of commissure posts. The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause mortality, stroke, or rehospitalization at 1 year.
RESULTS: Midframe underexpansion was identified in 13.9% of patients (84 of 604) and was associated with higher rates of the primary endpoint (33 of 84 [39.3%; 95% CI: 28.8%-50.5%] vs 54 of 520 [10.4%; 95% CI: 7.9%-13.3%]; P < 0.001) and each of its components. Furthermore, midframe underexpansion was independently associated with 1-year all-cause mortality (adjusted HR: 4.07; 95% CI: 2.26-7.33; P < 0.001). The only independent predictor of midframe underexpansion was the absence of postdilatation (adjusted OR: 5.76; 95% CI: 2.60-12.77; P < 0.001). Postdilatation significantly decreased the rate and extent of midframe underexpansion.
CONCLUSIONS: In this European cohort of ACURATE neo2 recipients, midframe underexpansion occurred in a minor proportion and was associated with poorer clinical outcomes through 1 year. Postdilatation effectively reduced the rate and extent of midframe underexpansion.","['Won-Keun Kim', 'Ole de Backer', 'Matthias Renker', 'Efstratios I Charitos', 'Chris Frawley', 'Yusuke Kobari', 'Mohamed Abdel-Wahab', 'Ahmed Abdelhafez', 'Niklas Lankisch', 'Darren Mylotte', 'Osama Soliman', 'Michael Joner', 'Helge Möllmann', 'Yeong-Hoon Choi', 'Samuel Sossalla']",JACC.

40305236,Management of difficult coronary anatomy during transcatheter aortic valve implantation: what are the key issues?,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Predicting and preventing coronary obstruction in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is crucial due to its high mortality risk.
RECENT FINDINGS: In native TAVR, predicting coronary obstruction requires assessing aortic cusp height, coronary artery height, valve-to-coronary distance, and leaflet calcium volume. The VIVID classification has been proposed for evaluating the risk of coronary obstruction in TAVR for failed bioprosthetic surgical valves. After TAVR with the Sapien 3 valve, the feasibility of redo TAVR and coronary access decreases with a shallower implantation of the initial Sapien 3. In redo TAVR of Sapien 3 within an Evolut valve, positioning the Sapien 3 outflow at node 4 improves redo TAVR feasibility and coronary accessibility compared to positioning at nodes 5 or 6. For valve sizing in redo TAVR with Sapien 3, in-vivo CT sizing results in smaller valve sizes than bench sizing, reducing coronary risk and improving redo TAVR feasibility. Leaflet modification and coronary stenting techniques and a dedicated leaflet-splitting device have been proposed to maintain coronary perfusion in high-risk cases.
SUMMARY: Coronary preservation in high-risk TAVR remains a significant challenge, requiring further research into preprocedural planning and leaflet modification strategies.","['Takayuki Onishi', 'Gilbert H L Tang']",Current opinion in cardiology,2025-04-25,10.1097/HCO.0000000000001229,https://doi.org/10.1097/HCO.0000000000001229,,Paid,Management of difficult coronary anatomy during transcatheter aortic valve implantation what are the key issues?

40301470,Risk factors and prognosis of silent cerebral infarction after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.,"The Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC)-3 definition of silent cerebral infarction among neurologic events after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) lacks clinical validation, yet its impact on postoperative in-hospital outcomes and long-term prognosis remains uncertain. This study aims to explore the perioperative related factors influencing the risk of SCI post-TAVR as defined by VARC-3 criteria, so as to identify high-risk individuals early and assess the effect of SCI on patient outcomes and one-year mortality following TAVR. This was a single-center study including 613 patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing TAVR, with all data collected prospectively in a dedicated database.We compared clinical baseline data, preoperative imaging results, perioperative factors, and intraoperative variables between patients with and without SCI according to VARC-3. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify risk factors associated with SCI. Propensity score matching (PSM) at a 1:2 ratio was employed based on fundamental characteristics such as age, gender, BMI, and medical history to minimize potential confounding. Post-matching, we analyzed differences in postoperative in-hospital outcomes and other results between the two groups. Survival times were compared using the Kaplan-Meier method, and survival curves were plotted. The log-rank test assessed statistical differences between the survival curves. Furthermore, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were conducted to determine risk factors for one-year postoperative mortality. Out of 827 TAVR patients screened, 613 were included in the final analysis-471 in the SCI group and 142 in the non-SCI group-resulting in an incidence rate of 76.8% for SCI. The occurrence of post-induction hypotension was significantly higher in the SCI group compared to the non-SCI group (70.28% vs. 61.27%, P = 0.043). Multivariate logistic regression revealed that post-induction hypotension lasting less than 10 min (odds ratio [OR]: 1.73; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.13-3.26; P = 0.009), hypotension lasting more than 10 min (OR: 1.98; 95% CI: 1.18-3.33; P = 0.01), and postoperative tachyarrhythmia (OR: 1.98; 95% CI: 1.27-3.07; P = 0.002) were significant risk factors for developing SCI after TAVR. Following 1:2 PSM, 416 patients remained-274 in the SCI group and 142 in the non-SCI group. After matching, the SCI group had a notably higher incidence of postoperative delirium compared to the non-SCI group (9.12% vs. 2.82%; P = 0.017), and their one-year mortality rate was also elevated (5.47% vs. 0.70%; P = 0.016). Additionally, multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that elevated preoperative creatinine levels (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.01; 95% CI: 1.01-1.02; P = 0.011), presence of SCI (HR: 10.81; 95% CI: 1.31-89.18; P = 0.027), Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) score greater than 7% (HR: 3.32; 95% CI: 1.07-10.33; P < 0.038), age 75 years or older (HR: 7.86; 95% CI: 1.01-14.47; P = 0.049), and a history of stroke (HR: 7.20; 95% CI: 2.32-22.35; P < 0.001) were independent risk factors for one-year mortality post-TAVR. Our findings suggest that post-induction hypotension and postoperative tachyarrhythmia are significant risk factors for SCI following TAVR as defined by VARC-3 criteria. Patients who developed SCI after TAVR exhibited higher rates of postoperative delirium and increased one-year mortality compared to those without this complication. Furthermore, factors such as elevated preoperative creatinine levels, an STS score above 7%, age of 75 years or older, and a prior history of stroke were associated with higher one-year mortality rates after TAVR. Given the negative impact of occult SCI on clinical outcomes, every effort should be made to reduce the risk of neurological complications after TAVR.","['Shuguang Wu', 'Yi Liu', 'Tingting Ni', 'Tao Lv', 'Yuanyuan Yao', 'Min Yan']",Scientific reports,2025-04-29,10.1038/s41598-025-99173-8,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-99173-8,PMC12041380,Free,Risk factors and prognosis of silent cerebral infarction after transcatheter aortic valve replacement WU 2025,pdfs\Risk factors and prognosis of silent cerebral infarction after transcatheter aortic valve replacement WU 2025.pdf,"['SCI', 'TAVR', 'SCI group', 'Risk factors', 'SCI group compared', 'silent cerebral infarction', 'factors', 'Risk', 'Academic Research Consortium', 'transcatheter aortic valve']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Clinical outcomes', 'Mortality', 'Postoperative delirium', 'Risk factors', 'Silent cerebral infarction', 'Transcatheter aortic valve replacement', 'VARC-3']"

40298371,AI-based prediction of left bundle branch block risk post-TAVI using pre-implantation clinical parameters.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) has revolutionized the treatment of severe aortic stenosis. Although its clinical efficacy is well established, the development of new-onset left bundle branch block (LBBB) following TAVI remains a frequent and concerning complication. This study aims to develop pre-implantation predictive models for new-onset LBBB after TAVI using both conventional machine learning (ML) algorithms and Large Language Models (LLMs).
METHODS: Of the 1113 patients who underwent TAVI over a 15-year period, 469 were included after excluding those with preexisting LBBB, pacing rhythm, or missing relevant data. Pre-procedural clinical parameters - such as valve type, valve size, patient demographics, and comorbidities - were analyzed. The dataset was split into training and testing sets. Several ML algorithms were employed, and performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, and F1 score. Additionally, LLMs (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) were assessed using Few-Shot and Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting.
RESULTS: New-onset persistent LBBB occurred in 15.29% of patients. Among ML models, XGBoost performed best. GPT-4 with CoT prompting demonstrated superior predictive performance compared to both conventional ML and GPT-3.5.
CONCLUSIONS: The current study establishes a predictive model leveraging pre-implantation parameters to anticipate the occurrence of new-onset left bundle branch block (LBBB) post-Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI).
Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) is a less invasive procedure used to treat patients with severe narrowing of the aortic valve. While it has significantly improved patient outcomes, some individuals develop a new heart rhythm problem called left bundle branch block (LBBB) after the procedure. LBBB can affect the heart’s electrical system and, in some cases, lead to complications such as the need for a permanent pacemaker.This study aimed to predict which patients are most likely to develop LBBB before the TAVR procedure by using artificial intelligence (AI) models. We analyzed data from 469 patients and tested different machine learning techniques, including traditional AI models and large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4. Our results showed that XGBoost, a machine learning algorithm, was the most accurate in predicting LBBB risk, while GPT-4 performed well when prompted using a specific reasoning approach (Chain of Thought method).These findings suggest that AI models can help identify high-risk patients before the procedure, allowing doctors to make better treatment decisions. However, further studies with larger patient groups are needed to confirm the accuracy of these predictions and improve personalized care for TAVR patients.","['Cheilas Vasileios', 'Filandrianos Giorgos', 'Martinos Antonios', 'Kostopoulou Anna']",Future cardiology,2025-04-29,10.1080/14796678.2025.2498866,https://doi.org/10.1080/14796678.2025.2498866,,Paid,AI based prediction of left bundle branch block risk post TAVI using pre implantation clinical parameters VASILEIOS 2025,Not available,"['Aortic Valve Implantation', 'left bundle branch', 'LBBB', 'Aortic Valve', 'bundle branch block', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'TAVI', 'bundle branch', 'Valve', 'Valve Implantation']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['LLMs', 'Transcatheter aortic valve replacement', 'aortic stenosis', 'artificial intelligence', 'individualized risk assessment', 'left bundle branch block', 'pre implantation predictors']"
40297162,"Current hotspot and study trend of transcatheter aortic valve replacement, a bibliometric analysis from 2009 to 2023.","INTRODUCTION: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), alternatively termed transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), represents a seminal advancement in cardiovascular interventions by obviating the necessity for open-heart surgery traditionally associated with surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). This technique entails percutaneous delivery of a bioprosthetic valve. Despite the surfeit of literature on TAVR over the past fifteen years, a bibliometric analysis is conspicuously absent.

40289515,Vascular Closure Devices for Large Bore Femoral Access After Transfemoral Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: A Network Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Large-bore femoral access is commonly required in transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TF-TAVR), but vascular access complications remain prevalent, impacting patient outcomes. Various vascular closure devices (VCDs) are used for hemostasis, including the suture-based Prostar XL, Perclose ProGlide, and ProStyle, and the plug-based MANTA device. However, comprehensive comparative evidence on these VCDs, particularly single Perclose strategies, is lacking.
METHODS: A systematic review and network meta-analysis were conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. We included randomized and observational studies comparing the safety and efficacy of VCDs for large-bore femoral access closure in TF-TAVR patients. Primary outcomes included major vascular complications; secondary outcomes included major and minor bleeding, minor vascular complications, VCD failure, and all-cause mortality. Frequentist and Bayesian analyses were performed using a random-effects model, with additional subgroup analyses of single Perclose strategies.
RESULTS: Thirty-five studies comprising 16,503 patients met inclusion criteria. The single Perclose strategy, with or without adjunct Angio-Seal or FemoSeal, significantly reduced major vascular complications compared to dual Perclose (RR: 1.9, 95% CI [1.2-3.01]), MANTA (RR: 1.89, 95% CI [1.03-3.48]), and Prostar XL (RR: 3.46, 95% CI [1.94-6.18]). Among secondary outcomes, single Perclose also ranked highest in reducing minor complications and bleeding.
CONCLUSION: Single Perclose strategies, especially when combined with Angio-Seal, demonstrated superior safety and efficacy for large-bore femoral access closure following TF-TAVR. These findings support the need for further randomized trials to validate single Perclose as a primary approach in TF-TAVR vascular closure.","['Sunil Upadhaya', 'Alina Upreti', 'Kunal Gupta', 'Bella Gonzalez-Perez', 'Radia Ksayer', 'Pedro Cox-Alomar', 'Cristina Sanina', 'Anand Irimpen', 'Serdar Farhan', 'Jose Wiley']",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,2025-04-27,10.1002/ccd.31565,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.31565,,Paid,Vascular Closure Devices for Large Bore Femoral Access After Transfemoral Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement A Network Meta Analysis UPADHAYA 2025,Not available,"['Large Bore Femoral', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Transfemoral Transcatheter Aortic', 'Large Bore', 'Bore Femoral Access', 'Valve Replacement', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'Aortic Valve', 'Transfemoral Transcatheter']",2025-05-12,Pending,[]
40289335,Feasibility of standby ECMO with preset femoral vascular sheaths for high-risk transcatheter aortic valve replacement.,"ObjectiveVeno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) can provide temporary circulatory and respiratory support allowing hemodynamic stabilization during high-risk transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). However, the optimal timing of VA-ECMO use in high-risk TAVR remains controversial. We aimed to report our experience using a novel standby ECMO strategy during high-risk TAVR.MethodsWe retrospectively evaluated consecutive patients who received high-risk TAVR with standby ECMO between March 1,2023 and March 1,2024 at the Beijing Anzhen Hospital. Small, 5F or 6F sheaths were placed in ipsilateral femoral vein and artery before TAVR procedures. The primary outcome of this study was survival to hospital discharge with good neurological recovery defined as cerebral performance category (CPC) 1-2.ResultsA total of 24 patients undergoing high-risk TAVR with standby ECMO were included.

40288578,Comparative Effectiveness and Safety of Self-Expanding Versus Balloon-Expandable Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a safe alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement for patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis at increased surgical risk. However, comparative data on self-expanding valves (SEV) versus balloon-expanding valves (BEV) remain limited.
METHODS: A comprehensive review of PubMed and Embase was conducted through April 2024, identifying eight studies (five randomized controlled trials and three propensity-matched observational studies) comparing SEV and BEV in TAVR. Primary outcomes included all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and device success per Valve Academic Research Consortium criteria, while secondary outcomes assessed bioprosthetic valve dysfunction and adverse events (annulus rupture/dissection, coronary artery occlusion, valve dislocation/embolization, valve thrombosis, moderate and severe paravalvular aortic regurgitation, endocarditis, permanent pacemaker implantation, major or life-threatening bleeding, acute kidney injury, and stroke).
RESULTS: The analysis included 4,032 patients (SEV = 2,006; BEV = 2,017). SEV was associated with higher rates of moderate-to-severe paravalvular aortic regurgitation [OR, 1.76; CI 1.13-2.74; P = 0.01] and permanent pacemaker placement [OR, 1.57; CI, 1.23-2.00; P = 0.0002] compared to BEV. No significant differences were observed in 30-day or 1-year all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, device success, bioprosthetic valve dysfunction, valve dislocation/embolization, valve thrombosis, endocarditis, major or life-threatening bleeding, coronary artery occlusion, stroke, rehospitalization, or acute kidney injury.
CONCLUSION: SEV and BEV demonstrated comparable outcomes in mortality and device success. However, the higher risk of moderate-to-severe paravalvular aortic regurgitation and permanent pacemaker placement with SEV should be considered when selecting the optimal TAVR valve for individual patients.","['Montaser Elkholy', 'Mohammad Akkawi', 'George G Kidess', 'Zaid Abdulelah', 'Abdallah Rayyan', 'Mohammad Riyad Al-Dqour', 'Ahmad Damlakhy', 'Yasemin Bahar', 'M Chadi Alraies']",The American journal of the medical sciences,2025-04-25,10.1016/j.amjms.2025.04.010,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjms.2025.04.010,,Paid,Comparative Effectiveness and Safety of Self Expanding Versus Balloon Expandable Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement A Systematic Review and Meta Analysis ELKHOLY 2025,Not available,"['Effectiveness and Safety', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Versus Balloon-Expandable Transcatheter', 'Balloon-Expandable Transcatheter Aortic', 'Valve Replacement', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'Systematic Review', 'Comparative Effectiveness', 'Valve']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Self-expanding valves', 'balloon-expanding valves', 'effectiveness', 'safety']"

40287133,"Temporal Trends in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Outcomes in Patients With Low-Flow, Low-Gradient Aortic Stenosis: Insights From the TOPAS-TAVI Registry.","BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) technology and techniques have continuously improved, but data on their impact in low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis (LFLG-AS) remain limited. In particular, scarce data exist comparing the results of TAVR with new-generation devices vs early-generation devices in these patients. This study evaluated the temporal trends in TAVR practices among LFLG-AS patients.
METHODS: This multicentre registry included 424 consecutive LFLG-AS patients undergoing TAVR from 2007 to 2023, stratified by device generation: new-generation devices (n = 193) and early-generation devices (n = 231). All-cause mortality or heart failure hospitalisation (HFH) at 1-year follow-up was the primary end point.
RESULTS: The median Society of Thoracic Surgeons score was lower in the new-generation group (5.3% [interquartile range [IQR] 3.4%-8.2%] vs 7.4% [IQR 5.0%-12.1%]; P < 0.001), whereas left ventricular ejection fractions(LVEFs) were similar (new: 31.2 ± 8.3%; early: 30.0 ± 8.8%; P = 0.16). New-generation devices were associated with a significant reduction in moderate-to-severe paravalvular leak after TAVR (2.6% vs 9.1%; P = 0.005), but 30-day mortality was similar (new: 1.6%; early: 3.9%; P = 0.15). At 1 year, new-generation devices were associated with a greater LVEF improvement (43.8 ± 12.5% vs 39.8 ± 11.5%; P = 0.003), but without a significant reduction in all-cause mortality or HFH (new: 23.8%; early: 28.1%; P = 0.32). Chronic kidney disease and low hemoglobin independently predicted worse outcomes (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite procedural improvements with new-generation TAVR devices, clinical outcomes in LFLG-AS patients remain suboptimal. LVEF significantly improved after TAVR with new-generation devices but failed to translate into improved clinical outcomes. These findings suggest that TAVR alone may not suffice in this population and underscore the need for a comprehensive therapeutic approach that integrates TAVR with optimised medical management and cardiac rehabilitation.","['Siddhartha Mengi', 'Luis Nombela-Franco', 'Pedro Cepas-Guillén', 'Stamatios Lerakis', 'Raj Makkar', 'Tarun Chakravarty', 'Vassilis Babaliaros', 'Henrique Barbosa Ribeiro', 'Emilie Pelletier-Beaumont', 'Philippe Pibarot', 'Josep Rodés-Cabau']",The Canadian journal of cardiology,2025-04-24,10.1016/j.cjca.2025.04.015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2025.04.015,,Paid,Temporal Trends in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Outcomes in Patients With Low Flow Low Gradient Aortic Stenosis Insights From the TOPAS TAVI Registry MENGI 2025,Not available,"['Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Low-Gradient Aortic Stenosis', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'Aortic Stenosis', 'Aortic Valve', 'Valve Replacement', 'Low-Gradient Aortic', 'Valve Replacement Outcomes', 'TAVR']",2025-05-12,Pending,[]

This case report highlights the diagnostic and therapeutic approach for a 72-year-old woman presenting with exertional chest pain, dyspnea, fatigue, and a history of melena. Methods: The diagnostic workup revealed severe microcytic anemia and a reduced vWF ristocetin-to-antigen ratio. Imaging confirmed severe degenerative aortic stenosis, while video capsule endoscopy identified angiodysplasia and telangiectasias in the small bowel as the source of gastrointestinal bleeding. Following evaluation by a multidisciplinary Heart Team, the patient underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with an Evolut Fx self-expanding prosthesis. Results: Post-procedural echocardiography showed mild paravalvular regurgitation. The patient's clinical course was favorable, with resolution of anemia and no further gastrointestinal bleeding episodes. Conclusions: Heyde syndrome requires a high index of suspicion for diagnosis in patients with severe aortic stenosis and unexplained anemia or gastrointestinal bleeding. TAVR offers an effective treatment option that not only resolves valvular pathology, but also mitigates associated bleeding risks.","['Claudiu Florin Rășinar', 'Alexandru Tîrziu', 'Rebeca Ionela Rășinar', 'Florin Gîru', 'Cristian Mornoș', 'Dan Gaiță', 'Constantin Tudor Luca', 'Daniel Miron Brie']",Journal of clinical medicine,2025-04-19,10.3390/jcm14082819,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm14082819,PMC12027620,Free,Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Reverses Heyde Syndrome A Case Report of Severe Aortic Stenosis and Gastrointestinal Bleeding RĂȘINAR 2025,pdfs\Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Reverses Heyde Syndrome A Case Report of Severe Aortic Stenosis and Gastrointestinal Bleeding RINAR 2.pdf,"['Severe Aortic Stenosis', 'Aortic Stenosis', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Gastrointestinal Bleeding', 'Aortic Valve', 'Aortic', 'Heyde Syndrome', 'Severe Aortic', 'Replacement Reverses Heyde']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Heyde syndrome', 'acquired von Willebrand syndrome', 'angiodysplasia', 'aortic stenosis', 'gastrointestinal bleeding', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR)', 'video capsule endoscopy (VCE)', 'von Willebrand factor (vWF)']"

When compared with TAVR, redo-TAVR is a rare and novel procedure. Current clinical data derived from registries suggest excellent safety, with low rates of 30-day and 1-year mortality following redo-TAVR. Proper understanding of data from bench studies regarding optimal valve configurations, of patient anatomy and of the technical properties of transcatheter heart valves (THV) is essential for patient selection and procedural success. Lifetime management of redo-TAVR should start before the index procedure, as the choice of the index THV has a major impact on the feasibility of redo-TAVR. Procedural optimization by adequate valve sizing, commissural alignment and adequate implant depth of both index and redo-THV are critical determinants of optimal hemodynamics for maximized valve longevity, as well as lifelong coronary access.","['Ruxandra I Sava', 'Philippe Garot', 'Hakim Benamer', 'Emmanuel Gall', 'Théo Pezel', 'Morad Djebbar', 'Neila Sayah', 'David Meier', 'Georgios Tzimas', 'Jérôme Garot', 'Florence Leclercq', 'Mariama Akodad']",Journal of clinical medicine,2025-04-17,10.3390/jcm14082770,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm14082770,PMC12027932,Free,Redo Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Procedural Optimization and Patient Selection From Bench to Clinical Practice SAVA 2025,pdfs\Redo Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Procedural Optimization and Patient Selection From Bench to Clinical Practice SAVA 2025.pdf,"['Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Valve', 'Valve Replacement Procedural', 'Valve Replacement', 'Aortic Valve', 'redo-TAVR', 'Patient Selection', 'bench studies', 'Redo-Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Patient']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['CT predictors', 'TAV-in-TAV', 'coronary access', 'coronary alignment']"
40283481,A Tale of Two Diseases: Decoding Aortic Stenosis and Cardiac Amyloidosis.,"Background/Objectives: Transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR-CA) is an infiltrative cardiomyopathy caused by transthyretin (TTR) amyloid deposition in the myocardium, increasingly recognized in patients with aortic stenosis (AS). This study aims to investigate the diagnostic challenges and therapeutic strategies for patients with both conditions, focusing on shared pathophysiological mechanisms and key diagnostic indicators. Methods: A multimodal diagnostic approach was applied, utilizing cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) and bone scintigraphy with technetium-99m-labeled tracers to assess AS patients with suspected ATTR-CA. Clinical signs, such as disproportionate heart failure symptoms, conduction abnormalities, and low-flow, low-gradient AS, were evaluated. Electrocardiographic findings, including low-voltage QRS complexes and pseudo-infarction patterns, were also assessed. Treatment options, including transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and emerging pharmacotherapies for ATTR-CA, were analyzed. Results: The study found that ATTR-CA is increasingly prevalent in AS patients, with shared mechanisms like oxidative stress and amyloid-induced tissue remodeling. Key diagnostic signs include disproportionate heart failure symptoms, conduction abnormalities, and specific electrocardiographic patterns. TAVR was effective in both isolated AS and AS with ATTR-CA, although patients with both conditions had a higher risk of heart failure hospitalization and persistent symptoms. Emerging pharmacotherapies, such as TTR stabilizers and gene-silencing agents, showed promise in slowing disease progression. Conclusions: A multimodal diagnostic approach is essential for the early detection of ATTR-CA in AS patients. Combining TAVR with emerging pharmacotherapies may improve long-term outcomes for this high-risk group, enhancing patient care in those with both conditions.","['Ioannis Gialamas', 'George E Zakynthinos', 'George Dimeas', 'Panteleimon Pantelidis', 'Elias Gialafos', 'Styliani Brili', 'Athina Goliopoulou', 'Ourania Katsarou', 'Elsi Tryfou', 'Konstantinos Kalogeras', 'Gerasimos Siasos', 'Evangelos Oikonomou']",Journal of clinical medicine,2025-04-12,10.3390/jcm14082652,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm14082652,PMC12027563,Free,A Tale of Two Diseases Decoding Aortic Stenosis and Cardiac Amyloidosis GIALAMAS 2025,pdfs\A Tale of Two Diseases Decoding Aortic Stenosis and Cardiac Amyloidosis GIALAMAS 2025.pdf,"['Aortic Stenosis', 'patients', 'Decoding Aortic Stenosis', 'ATTR-CA', 'Aortic', 'Cardiac Amyloidosis', 'Stenosis', 'TAVR', 'Amyloidosis', 'Cardiac']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['AS', 'ATTR', 'aortic stenosis', 'cardiac amyloidosis', 'cardiomyopathy', 'hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis', 'low-flow', 'low-gradient aortic stenosis', 'transthyretin', 'transthyretin amyloidosis', 'wild-type transthyretin amyloidosis']"

40270122,The Impact of Concomitant Mitral Regurgitation on Echocardiography Parameters After TransCatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Mitral regurgitation (MR) commonly coexists with aortic stenosis (AS) and is a potential risk factor influencing outcomes following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the mean changes in key echocardiographic parameters before and after TAVR and to compare these changes between patients with moderate-to-severe MR (MR ≥ 2) and those with none-to-mild MR (MR < 2).
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted using six electronic databases. We included studies that evaluated patients undergoing TAVR, classified them based on baseline MR grade ≥ 2 (moderate/severe MR) or MR grade < 2 (none/mild MR), and reported the mean difference (MD) in echocardiographic parameters before and after TAVR in both groups. The primary outcomes included changes in ejection fraction (EF), LV end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) index, LV end-systolic volume (LVESV) index, LV end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), LV end-systolic diameter (LVESD), aortic valve area (AVA), and the mean aortic gradient. Pooled MDs were analyzed using a random-effects model.
RESULTS: Thirteen studies with 7163 patients were included, of which 2376 had an MR ≥ 2. The MR < 2 and MR ≥ 2 groups experienced significant improvements in AVA and reductions in mean aortic gradient, LVEDV index, LVESV index, LVEDD, and LVESD. Compared to MR < 2 patients, those with MR ≥ 2 exhibited significantly greater improvements in EF (MD = 2.03; 95% CI: 0.81, 3.24), LVEDV index (MD = -5.55; 95% CI: -7.85, -3.26), LVESV index (MD = -5.43; 95% CI: -7.28, -3.58), LVESD (MD = -2.23; 95% CI: -3.71, -0.26), and mean aortic gradient (MD = 1.43; 95% CI: 0.79, 2.07). However, the changes in LVEDD and AVA were not significantly different between the groups.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that patients with moderate-to-severe baseline MR before TAVR showed greater pronounced improvements in specific echocardiographic parameters related to LV function and geometry, particularly in LVEF, LVEDV index, LVESV index, and LVESD, compared to those with none-to-mild MR. Future studies should focus on stratifying outcomes according to MR etiology and using advanced imaging techniques to delineate better the mechanisms underlying these improvements.","['Bahar Darouei', 'Reza Amani-Beni', 'Mehrdad Rabiee Rad', 'Ghazal Ghasempour Dabaghi', 'Reza Eshraghi', 'Ashkan Bahrami', 'Ehsan Amini-Salehi', 'Seyyed Mohammad Hashemi', 'Sadegh Mazaheri-Tehrani', 'Mohammad Reza Movahed']",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,2025-04-24,10.1002/ccd.31555,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.31555,,Paid,The Impact of Concomitant Mitral Regurgitation on Echocardiography Parameters After TransCatheter Aortic Valve Replacement A Systematic Review and Meta Analysis DAROUEI 2025,Not available,"['Concomitant Mitral Regurgitation', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Impact of Concomitant', 'Systematic Review', 'Concomitant Mitral', 'TransCatheter Aortic Valve', 'Mitral Regurgitation', 'Valve Replacement', 'Aortic Valve', 'Echocardiography Parameters']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['aortic valve stenosis', 'echocardiography', 'meta‐analysis', 'mitral valve insufficiency', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"
40269711,Associations between new-onset postoperative atrial fibrillation and changes in left ventricular mass index in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement.,"BACKGROUND: New-onset postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) is common after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). At present, the impact of POAF on cardiac remodeling after TAVR has not been thoroughly studied.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the impact of POAF on cardiac remodeling and its association with clinical outcomes after TAVR.
METHODS: 601 patients undergoing TAVR for severe aortic stenosis were evaluated. Of these, 253 patients were identified to have POAF, which was categorized as normal left ventricular mass index (LVMI) in 54 (21%) and high LVMI in 199 (79%). The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause death, heart failure rehospitalization and disabling stroke. Reverse remodeling was assessed by transthoracic echocardiography.
RESULTS: In POAF patients, the 3-year cumulative incidence of primary composite outcome in the high LVMI subgroup was significantly higher than that in the normal LVMI subgroup (9.3 ± 3.3% vs. 13.5 ± 3.9%; p = 0.02). The incidence of LVMI regression after TAVR was lower in patients with POAF than in those without (65.6 ± 3.0% vs. 82.6 ± 2.7% at 3 years; p = 0.029). Furthermore, the 3-year cumulative incidence of the primary composite outcome and cardiovascular death was highest in the group of POAF without LVMI regression. Baseline LVMI (β = -1.73, p < 0.001) and POAF (β = -1.46, p < 0.001) were independent predictors of change in LVMI at one year.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with POAF had less LVMI regression and impaired cardiac reverse remodeling after TAVR, which increased the incidence of all-cause death and heart failure rehospitalization. Therefore, clinicians should be more proactive in monitoring and treating POAF after TAVR.","['Hua-Jie Zheng', 'Jun Li', 'Ling-Feng Tang', 'Mei Guo', 'Ya-Nan Wei', 'Wei Cheng']",BMC cardiovascular disorders,2025-04-23,10.1186/s12872-025-04763-z,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12872-025-04763-z,PMC12016421,Free,Associations between new onset postoperative atrial fibrillation and changes in left ventricular mass index in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement ZHENG 2025,pdfs\Associations between new onset postoperative atrial fibrillation and changes in left ventricular mass index in patients undergoing transcath.pdf,"['POAF', 'TAVR', 'LVMI', 'patients', 'patients undergoing TAVR', 'high LVMI', 'LVMI regression', 'aortic valve replacement', 'POAF patients', 'POAF group']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Aortic stenosis', 'Cardiac reverse remodeling', 'Postoperative atrial fibrillation', 'Transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"
40269687,Computed tomography-based coronary lumen volume to myocardial mass ratio in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a novel method for risk assessment.,"BACKGROUND: The coronary lumen volume to myocardial mass (V/M) ratio has been suggested as a quantitative metric of potential imbalance between coronary blood supply and myocardial oxygen demand. This study was designed to assess the prognostic value of the V/M ratio for predicting major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
METHODS: This study enrolled patients who received a standard planning computed tomography (CT) scan before TAVR and dichotomized at the median of 33.31 mm³/g of V/M ratio into groups with low V/M ratio and high V/M ratio. The V/M ratio was calculated by coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA). The endpoint was a composite of all-cause mortality, stroke, and hospitalization for heart failure. The cumulative incidence of the MACE was compared using Kaplan-Meyer plots and uni- and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis.
RESULTS: In total, 139 patients were enrolled in this study finally (mean age 71.7 ± 6.7 years, 41.7% female). The mean V/M ratio was considerably lower in patients with MACE than in those without MACE (26.5 ± 4.9mm3/g vs. 34.0 ± 3.8mm3/g, P<0.001). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression showed that the low V/M ratio group (≤ 33.31 mm³/g) had a higher risk of MACE after TAVR (HR: 6.14, 95%CI: 1.37-27.54; P = 0.018).
CONCLUSIONS: The lower V/M ratio could serve as an independent predictor of MACE in patients undergoing TAVR.

40268155,Preprocedural CT angiography and machine learning for mortality prediction after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.,"Prediction of outcomes following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is challenging. Considering that in aortic stenosis outcomes are governed by both valve degeneration and myocardial adverse remodeling, we aimed to evaluate machine-learning leveraging pre-procedural computed tomography (CT) for the prediction of 1-year mortality following TAVR. The analysis included data of consecutive patients who underwent TAVR at a high-volume center between January 2017 and January 2022 and was externally validated on unseen data from 3 international sites. Machine learning by extreme gradient boosting was trained and tested using clinical variables, CT-derived volumetric measurements including myocardial mass, and quantitative fibrocalcific aortic valve characteristics measured using standardized software. The EuroScore II and a separate machine learning risk score based exclusively on baseline clinical characteristics served as comparators. The derivation cohort included 631 consecutive patients (48 % men, 80 ± 8 years old, EuroSCORE II 6.5 [4.6-10.3] %). Machine learning was externally validated on data of 596 patients (48 % men, 81 ± 8 years old, EuroSCORE II 5.4 [4.7-8.1] %). In external validation, the machine learning prognostic risk score had an area under the receiver operator curve of 0.79 (0.74-0.84) which was superior to the EuroSCORE 0.59 (0.53-0.66), and the machine learning risk based on clinical data alone 0.64 (0.59-0.69), p < 0.001 for difference. Machine-learning integrating clinical data and CT-derived imaging characteristics was found to predict 1-year all-cause mortality following TAVR significantly better than clinical variables or clinical risk scores alone; and can help identify patients at higher prognostic risk prior to the procedure.","['Jacek Kwiecinski', 'Kajetan Grodecki', 'Konrad Pieszko', 'Maciej Dabrowski', 'Zbigniew Chmielak', 'Wojciech Wojakowski', 'Julia Niemierko', 'Jadwiga Fijalkowska', 'Dariusz Jagielak', 'Philipp Ruile', 'Simon Schoechlin', 'Hesham Elzomor', 'Piotr Slomka', 'Adam Witkowski', 'Damini Dey']",Progress in cardiovascular diseases,2025-04-21,10.1016/j.pcad.2025.04.007,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pcad.2025.04.007,,Paid,Preprocedural CT angiography and machine learning for mortality prediction after transcatheter aortic valve replacement KWIECINSKI 2025,Not available,"['aortic valve replacement', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'machine learning', 'valve replacement', 'aortic valve', 'Preprocedural CT angiography', 'transcatheter aortic', 'TAVR', 'machine', 'learning']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Aortic stenosis', 'CT angiography', 'Machine learning', 'Risk scores', 'TAVR']"

40265281,Evaluation of Tissue Annular Motion Displacement in Patients With Severe Aortic Stenosis With Normal Ejection Fraction.,"AIM: The purpose of this study was to investigate the value of the tissue annular motion displacement (TMAD) parameter in assessing left ventricular systolic function in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) and to investigate the risk factors for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) in patients with severe AS with a biplane Simpson's method ejection fraction (LVEF-Simpson) ≥ 50%.
METHODS: We enrolled 81 patients diagnosed with severe AS and 22 controls. Comparative analyses were performed between the groups, and longitudinal follow-up assessments tracked the incidence of MACEs. Survival analysis, utilizing Kaplan-Meier curves, was employed to determine the prognostic significance of TMAD parameters.
RESULTS: TMAD parameters showed negative linear correlations with left ventricle global longitudinal strain (LVGLS). Overall, 69 patients (85.2%) underwent successful transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), which significantly improves myocardial longitudinal systolic function. MACE occurred in 12 (14.8%) AS patients during the follow-up period.
CONCLUSION: TMAD parameters allowed early detection of left ventricle systolic dysfunction (LVSF) in severe AS patients with normal ejection fraction and correlated well with LVGLS, and TMADmid-A4C was a strong predictor of MACE in severe AS patients with preserved LVEF.","['Jie Feng', 'Yao Li', 'Shiyuan Zhang', 'Haixia Wei', 'Hangyu Liu', 'Yanqing Wu']",Journal of clinical ultrasound : JCU,2025-04-23,10.1002/jcu.24032,https://doi.org/10.1002/jcu.24032,,Paid,Evaluation of Tissue Annular Motion Displacement in Patients With Severe Aortic Stenosis With Normal Ejection Fraction FENG 2025,Not available,"['Tissue Annular Motion', 'Annular Motion Displacement', 'Severe Aortic Stenosis', 'Normal Ejection Fraction', 'Annular Motion', 'Tissue Annular', 'Motion Displacement', 'Simpson method ejection', 'Ejection Fraction', 'method ejection fraction']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['LVEF', 'aortic stenosis', 'speckle tracking imaging', 'tissue motion annular displacement', 'transthoracic echocardiography']"
40264567,Transcatheter aortic valve replacement via direct aortic access for severe aortic stenosis with double aortic arch.,"Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is an established treatment for managing severe aortic stenosis. Preoperative planning requires cautious identification of the access route, which can be challenging in patients with anatomical abnormalities of the aorta. Double aortic arch (DAA) is a congenital condition where the aorta bifurcates into two separate vessels that encircle the trachea and esophagus, thereby forming a vascular ring. This condition accounts for ~1% of congenital cardiovascular anomalies. Previous reports on TAVR performed on patients with DAA are limited, and there is no consensus on the appropriate access route. Herein, we present an 85-year-old female patient with DAA and aortic stenosis who underwent a successful TAVR using the direct aortic approach.","['Akihito Arai', 'Mimiko Tabata', 'Kenichiro Takahashi', 'Ryo Izubuchi', 'Minako Hayakawa', 'Joshi Tsutsumi', 'Akihiro Urabe']",Journal of surgical case reports,2025-04-12,10.1093/jscr/rjaf251,https://doi.org/10.1093/jscr/rjaf251,PMC12013706,Free,Transcatheter aortic valve replacement via direct aortic access for severe aortic stenosis with double aortic arch ARAI 2025,pdfs\Transcatheter aortic valve replacement via direct aortic access for severe aortic stenosis with double aortic arch ARAI 2025.pdf,"['aortic', 'Transcatheter aortic valve', 'double aortic arch', 'direct aortic approach', 'aortic valve replacement', 'aortic arch', 'TAVR', 'severe aortic stenosis', 'aortic valve', 'direct aortic']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['direct aortic approach', 'double aortic arch', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"
40262657,SINGLE PERCLOSE PLUS PLUG BASED DEVICE VERSUS DOUBLE PERCLOSE FOR PERCUTANEOUS LARGE BORE ARTERIAL ACCESS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META ANALYSIS.,"OBJECTIVE: Vascular Closure primarily utilizing Suture Based Devices (SBD) are frequently used for large bore percutaneous arterial access in patients undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVR) and Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (EVAR). Little is known about the intentional combination of SBD with PBD. Main objective was to determine the efficacy of adopting a combined SBD and PBD strategy compared to double SBD for large bore arterial access.
REVIEW METHODS: We searched randomized and observational studies comparing both strategies and that reported the outcomes of major vascular and vascular complications, major bleeding, all bleeding events, need for surgical or endovascular interventions, device failure, additional device and pseudoaneurysm. A meta-analysis was conducted, with heterogeneity assessed using the I2 statistic and a random-effects model applied to all outcomes. Additionally, trial sequential analysis was performed.
RESULTS: We included 3 randomized trials and 4 observational studies with 2,064 access. Sheath size ranged from 13 to 24 Fr. Vascular complications (RR 0.54; p<0.01), major vascular complications (RR 0.55; p=0.04), major bleeding (RR 0.49; p=0.02), need for surgical intervention (RR 0.25; p=0.01), and additional device (RR 0.12; p<0.01) were significantly less common in patients treated with the SBD and PBD technique. Pseudoaneurysm (RR 1.13; p=0.71), all bleeding events (RR 0.59; p=0.1), and endovascular intervention (RR 0.65; p=0.26) were not significantly different between groups.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that one SBD, combined with PBD, was associated with less femoral access complications when compared to the exclusive double SBD as a vascular closure strategy in patients with large bore arterial access.","['Enrico Prajiante Bertolino', 'Milena Monteiro Mastra Fontoura', 'Cynthia Florêncio de Mesquita', 'Dilson da Silva Pimentel', 'Miguel Godeiro Fernandez', 'Ivo Queiroz', 'Braiana Ángeles Díaz Herrera', 'Altino Ono Moraes', 'Ross Millner', 'Grace Carvajal Mulatti']",Annals of vascular surgery,2025-04-20,10.1016/j.avsg.2025.04.107,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.avsg.2025.04.107,,Paid,SINGLE PERCLOSE PLUS PLUG BASED DEVICE VERSUS DOUBLE PERCLOSE FOR PERCUTANEOUS LARGE BORE ARTERIAL ACCESS A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META ANALYSIS BERTOLINO 2025,Not available,"['VERSUS DOUBLE PERCLOSE', 'SINGLE PERCLOSE', 'PLUG BASED DEVICE', 'BASED DEVICE VERSUS', 'LARGE BORE ARTERIAL', 'BORE ARTERIAL ACCESS', 'Aortic Valve Implantation', 'DEVICE VERSUS DOUBLE', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'PERCLOSE PLUS PLUG']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Angioseal', 'Closure device', 'Endovascular aneurysm repair', 'Perclose', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement', 'vascular closure']"
40262017,Perioperative Outcomes in Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement with Concomitant Mitral Regurgitation: A Meta-Analysis.,"Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is widely performed in high-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis. However, the effects of baseline concomitant mitral regurgitation (MR) on perioperative outcomes remain unclear. This study evaluated the impact of concomitant MR severity on short-term TAVR outcomes. A systematic search of 6 electronic databases was conducted. Studies that stratified patients based on MR severity (MR ≥2 vs. <2 or MR ≥3 vs. <3) and reported perioperative outcomes, including short-term mortality, in-hospital mortality, acute kidney injury (AKI), pacemaker implantation, bleeding, vascular complications, and MR improvement (up to 1 week and 1 month) were eligible. Data from 26 studies (32,453 patients) demonstrated that patients with baseline moderate-to-severe MR (MR ≥2) had a 49% (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.32-1.70) increased risk of short-term mortality, a 41% (95% CI, 1.22-1.63) higher risk of in-hospital mortality, and a 38% (95% CI, 1.17-1.62) higher risk of AKI than those with none-to-mild MR (MR<2). Patients with an MR ≥3 had an even greater 72% (95% CI, 1.37-2.16) increase in short-term mortality. No significant differences were observed in pacemaker implantation, bleeding, or vascular complications between groups. Additionally, after TAVR, MR improved in 36% of patients by at least 1 grade within 1 week, increasing to 44% by 1 month. In TAVR patients, MR ≥2 was associated with significantly higher early mortality and AKI risk, underscoring the need for a comprehensive perioperative risk assessment. Future studies should examine the differential impact of functional and degenerative MR.","['Reza Amani-Beni', 'Bahar Darouei', 'Mehrdad Rabiee Rad', 'Ghazal Ghasempour Dabaghi', 'Reza Eshraghi', 'Ashkan Bahrami', 'Ehsan Amini-Salehi', 'Seyyed Mohammad Hashemi', 'Sadegh Mazaheri-Tehrani', 'Mohammad Reza Movahed']",Cardiology in review,2025-04-22,10.1097/CRD.0000000000000919,https://doi.org/10.1097/CRD.0000000000000919,,Paid,Perioperative Outcomes in Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement with Concomitant Mitral Regurgitation A Meta Analysis AMANI-BENI 2025,Not available,"['Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Patients Undergoing Transcatheter', 'Concomitant Mitral Regurgitation', 'Undergoing Transcatheter', 'Aortic Valve', 'Valve Replacement', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'Mitral Regurgitation']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['aortic valve stenosis', 'mitral valve insufficiency', 'mortality', 'perioperative care', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"

This study investigates sex-related differences in survival and safety outcomes in patients with aortic stenosis undergoing TAVR.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Library until November 2024. Individual patient data (IPD) were reconstructed from published Kaplan-Meier curves and compared using Cox-proportional hazards model for overall survival and cardiovascular mortality. Pooled risk ratios (RR) for safety outcomes at 30-days and one year were estimated using a random-effects model. A total of 48 studies (69,355 women and 65,580 men) were included. Meta-analysis of reconstructed IPD showed that men were at higher risk of all-cause mortality at five years (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.24, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.20-1.28, P<0.001) and cardiovascular mortality at four years (HR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.21-1.49, P<0.001) compared with women. In random-effects meta-analysis, men faced a higher risk of permanent pacemaker implantation (RR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.16-1.44, P<0.001) during the first year. Men experienced a lower risk of stroke (RR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.64-0.87, P<0.001) and major vascular complications (RR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.49-0.69, P<0.001) at 30 days, and a lower risk of major bleeding (RR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.70-0.84, P<0.001) as well as major vascular complications (RR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.43-0.68, P<0.001) within the first year.
CONCLUSION: Men demonstrated poorer five-year overall survival and four-year cardiovascular survival following TAVR compared with women.

40260550,Impact of Calcified Raphe on TAVR in Bicuspid Patients: Predicting Redo-TAVR Feasibility and Virtual Planning Implications.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with bicuspid aortic stenosis who receive transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) may require subsequent valve interventions in their lifetime; however, the feasibility of redo-TAVR in this population is uncertain. We aimed to assess redo-TAVR feasibility in bicuspid patients and develop a predictive virtual valve planning algorithm.
METHODS: We studied computed tomography scans of bicuspid patients who received a balloon-expandable transcatheter heart valve (THV) in the LRT trial (Low Risk TAVR). Redo-TAVR feasibility, determined by valve-to-coronary and valve-to-aorta measurements on 30-day computed tomography, was assessed according to raphe location and calcification. A virtual valve planning algorithm was developed using baseline and 30-day computed tomography scans.
RESULTS: Among 42 patients (left/right cusp fusion: n=34; right/noncusp fusion: n=4; 2-sinus: n=4), redo-TAVR was feasible in 64%, while 36% would likely require leaflet modification to prevent coronary obstruction. Patients with left/right fusion and calcified raphe had higher redo-TAVR feasibility (88% versus 35%, P<0.001) due to favorable shifting of the THV away from the coronary ostia. A bicuspid virtual planning algorithm accounting for 83.4% THV underexpansion, resulting in an 11.9% taller frame and translation of the THV away from the calcified raphe (mean valve shift 6.6 mm) achieved 86.7% sensitivity and 88.9% specificity for predicting redo-TAVR feasibility.
CONCLUSIONS: Calcified raphe in left/right cusp fusion shifts the THV away from the coronary ostia, reducing coronary obstruction risk during redo-TAVR. Underexpansion causing increased THV frame height and valve shifting is common in bicuspid patients; a virtual planning algorithm accounting for these aspects can accurately assess redo-TAVR risk.

40258409,The randomized controlled trial to compare temporary permanent pacemaker vs temporary pacemaker in patients with conduction block after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: Rationale and design of the RECOVER trial.,"RATIONALE: Current guidelines and expert consensus recommend different time thresholds of temporary pacemaker (TM) indwelling in patients with conduction block after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Accordingly, this lack of clinical evidence and effective strategies has resulted in extensive variations in permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation patterns, potentially leading to over-early PPM implantation. The use of a temporary permanent pacemaker (TPPM), which involves an active fixation pacing lead and an external pulse generator secured to the skin surface, may be effective and safe in these patients. TPPM may improve postoperative mobility and facilitate early discharge, while providing prolonged and stable pacing for the recovery of conduction block, thereby reducing unnecessary PPM implantation.
DESIGN: The RECOVER trial is a prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled study comparing TPPM vs TM in patients with conduction block after TAVR. The trial will enroll 160 subjects across 13 sites in China. Inclusion criteria include patients with persistent third-degree atrioventricular block (AVB), second-degree AVB, first-degree AVB with symptoms (PR interval >300 ms), alternating bundle branch block or bifascicular block with syncope/blackness related symptoms occurred during TAVR procedure or within 1 month after TAVR. Enrolled patients will be randomized 1:1 to the TPPM group for a 1-month bridge or the TM group for conventional 24 to 48 hours pacing. The primary effectiveness endpoint is the rate of PPM implantation at 6 months after the occurrence of AVB. Secondary effectiveness endpoint is the rate of PPM implantation at 1 month after the occurrence of AVB. Safety endpoints include all-cause mortality and TPPM/TM/PPM procedure-related complications during the 6-month follow-up. Key data collected will include sociodemographic information, medical history, electrocardiograph, HOLTER, echocardiography, contrast-enhanced cardiac CT, details of procedures and pacemaker interrogation. Indication for PPM implantation will be adjudicated by an independent pacing electrophysiologist committee.
CONCLUSION: The RECOVER trial will evaluate whether TPPM is superior to conventional TM in reducing the rate of PPM implantation in patients with conduction block after TAVR, with a buffer period to distinguish whether conduction block is reversible or persistent.

40254143,Management of TAVR in asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients: Insights from resting angiographic microvascular resistance.,"BACKGROUND: The optimal timing of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) remains controversial. Microvascular dysfunction and increased microcirculatory resistance have been linked to adverse outcomes in AS, suggesting that resting angiographic microvascular resistance (AMRr) may aid in identifying higher-risk patients.
METHOD: We conducted a retrospective study of 180 severe AS patients who underwent TAVR at Fuwai Hospital between 2012 and 2021. Patients were grouped based on an AMRr cutoff value of 490, identified through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The primary endpoint was the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), including all-cause mortality, heart failure, and myocardial infarction. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were used to compare outcomes between groups.
RESULTS: A total of 180 asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic AS patients undergoing TAVR were enrolled. After a 40-month follow-up, the AMRr >490 group had a higher MACE risk, mainly driven by readmission for heart failure. Additionally, continuous analysis indicated that every 100-unit increase in AMRr was associated with an 18 %, 17 %, and 1.58-fold increased risk of MACE, all-cause mortality, and NOAF, respectively. Moreover, the addition of AMRr to a clinical model significantly improved the prediction of MACE (AUC 0.678 vs. 0.582, p = 0.023).
CONCLUSION: Asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic AS patients with AMRr >490 had a significantly higher incidence of MACE and heart failure rehospitalization than those with AMRr ≤490 after TAVR. The inclusion of AMRr in a predictive model improved the accuracy for long-term MACE, demonstrating an incremental prognostic value.","['Wence Shi', 'Moyang Wang', 'Guannan Niu', 'Zhenyan Zhao', 'Zheng Zhou', 'Dejing Feng', 'Yongjian Wu', 'Hongliang Zhang']",International journal of cardiology,2025-08-01,10.1016/j.ijcard.2025.133263,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcard.2025.133263,,Paid,Management of TAVR in asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients Insights from resting angiographic microvascular resistance SHI 2025,Not available,"['angiographic microvascular resistance', 'resting angiographic microvascular', 'asymptomatic or minimally', 'minimally symptomatic patients', 'minimally symptomatic', 'TAVR', 'MACE', 'patients', 'Insights from resting', 'angiographic microvascular']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Asymptomatic aortic stenosis', 'Microvascular dysfunction', 'Resting angiographic microvascular resistance', 'Transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"

Acute aortic dissection, although rare, is a life-threatening complication associated with TAVR.
CASE SUMMARY: An older man with severe aortic stenosis underwent TAVR. During valve deployment, catheter manipulation caused intimal disruption, leading to acute type A aortic dissection (TAAD). Remarkably, the dissection spontaneously sealed after prosthetic valve placement, thereby avoiding emergency surgery. A 6-month follow-up computed tomography angiography scan showed no extension of the dissection.
DISCUSSION: In the case we report, the dissection spontaneously sealed with the use of a prosthetic valve, a finding that reinforces the feasibility of nonsurgical management of iatrogenic TAAD during TAVR in select cases.

It involved initiation of extracorporeal circulatory support, followed by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and, subsequently, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) using a TaurusElite valve (Peijia Medical). This strategy resulted in marked hemodynamic improvement.
DISCUSSION: This case highlights the efficacy and safety of concurrent PCI and TAVR as a lifesaving strategy for cardiogenic shock patients with concomitant severe CAD and AS.
TAKE-HOME MESSAGES: Emergency PCI with concurrent TAVR represents a viable lifesaving strategy for cardiogenic shock patients with coexisting severe CAD and AS. Prophylactic extracorporeal circulation initiation is critical in TAVR procedures for patients with cardiogenic shock to prevent circulatory collapse and maintain systemic perfusion.","['Tong Tan', 'Enjun Zhu', 'Hao Cui', 'Yongqiang Lai']",JACC.

40252063,One-Stop TEVAR and TAVR Procedure for Severe Aortic Stenosis With Aortic Arch Aneurysm.,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become the fundamental treatment for patients with aortic stenosis (AS). Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is also recommended for penetrating aortic ulcer. Especially in older patients with severe AS and penetrating aortic ulcer at the same time, the surgical method brings significant risk.
CASE SUMMARY: We report a case of a 74-year-old male patient who presented with a 10-day history of dyspnea. He was diagnosed with severe AS with aortic valve insufficiency (penetrating aortic ulcer) and had multiple comorbidities. The patient underwent a 1-stop TEVAR + TAVR procedure.
DISCUSSION: The challenge was compounded by the patient's extremely narrow femoral access. This case demonstrates the 2 operations can be performed as a procedure.
TAKE-HOME MESSAGES: Management of patients with severe AS and concurrent aortic pathology is complicated.

40252062,Extreme Anchoring: Self-Expanding Valve TAVR for Severe Pure Aortic Regurgitation in Sinus of Valsalva Aneurysm.,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for pure aortic regurgitation (PAR) remains technically challenging because of the lack of calcified annular structures for device anchoring.
CASE SUMMARY: We report successful noncoronary sinus pivot implantation (NCPI) of a 29-mm self-expanding valve in a high-risk PAR patient (Society of Thoracic Surgeons 8.2%) with extreme root dilatation and no calcification under the STABLE protocol. Post-procedure imaging confirmed hemodynamic success, no paravalvular leak, ventricular recovery, and optimal root remodeling.
DISCUSSION: This case highlights the role of annular-subannular anchoring (NCPI technique) and multimodality imaging in TAVR PAR with sinus of Valsalva aneurysm, addressing migration risks and expanding procedural feasibility beyond calcific stenosis-a critical advancement in an understudied population.

KEY STEPS: Our key steps included the following: 1) unsuccessful withdrawal of the buckled delivery system and valve into the inline sheath; 2) transradial snaring of the delivery system, followed by traction from both ends to reduce the amount of buckling; and 3) once elongated as much as possible, the malfunctioning Evolut delivery system and valve were removed as a unit over the wire.
POTENTIAL PITFALLS: Aortic, iliac, or femoral injury: Reliant balloon was placed in the distal aorta use in case of arterial rupture.
TAKE-HOME MESSAGES: The Evolut delivery system can buckle and accordion under tension in complex aortic anatomy. A technique of snaring from above and tension from below can mitigate the buckled area and allow removal of the damaged delivery system via the endovascular route.","['Ahmed Ghoneem', 'Mubashir Mumtaz', 'Paul D Mahoney']",JACC.

40248296,Even aortic insufficiency can be treated percutaneously: right?,"Moderate or severe aortic insufficiency (AI) is a relatively rare condition but with significant clinical implications, especially in elderly patients at high surgical risk. Although surgical aortic valve replacement remains the gold standard for treatment, a significant proportion of patients are not eligible due to the high surgical risk. In recent years, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has revolutionized the treatment of aortic stenosis, but its application to AI has encountered significant challenges, mainly related to specific anatomical characteristics of this population. This review provides an overview of the evolution of the transcatheter treatment of AI, highlighting the critical issues of first-generation TAVI devices and the improvements achieved with new-generation and dedicated devices, such as JenaValve and J-Valve. Preliminary data demonstrate encouraging procedural results, including a reduction in residual insufficiency and improved safety in patients at high surgical risk. However, limitations remain, including the high incidence of pacemaker implantation and the lack of long-term randomized clinical trials. In light of technological advances, TAVI represents a promising therapeutic option for selected patients with AI, if performed in high-volume centres with extensive experience in the treatment of aortic disease.","['Nicolò Azzola Guicciardi', 'Alessandro Beneduce', 'Francesco Maisano']",European heart journal supplements : journal of the European Society of Cardiology,2025-03-12,10.1093/eurheartjsupp/suaf026,https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartjsupp/suaf026,PMC12001779,Free,Even aortic insufficiency can be treated percutaneously right?

40246047,Management of asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis: A critical review of guidelines and clinical outcomes.,"BACKGROUND: Asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis (AS) poses a clinical challenge with variations in recommendations for management.
OBJECTIVES: We sought to compare contemporary guidelines focusing on asymptomatic AS management and present a summary of contemporary studies on early intervention in these patients.
METHODS: Systematic search of electronic databases was conducted with guidelines analyzed using a comparative matrix. A pooled random-effects meta-analysis of randomized controlled trial (RCT) data comparing intervention versus clinical surveillance in asymptomatic severe AS was also performed.
RESULTS: Four guidelines from ACC/AHA, ESC/EACTS, JCS/JSCS/JATS/JSVS, and NICE were included encompassing 108 recommendations. Consensus was found for intervention thresholds including left ventricular dysfunction and very severe AS while discrepancies existed in the utility of biomarkers, myocardial fibrosis, exercise stress testing and choice of intervention. Despite variation in study inclusion criteria, current RCTs on the management of asymptomatic AS indicated a significant reduction in rates of major adverse cardiovascular events when comparing early intervention to clinical surveillance (hazard ratio [HR] 0.52 [0.42, 0.63]), driven primarily by reductions in unplanned hospitalizations (HR 0.41 [0.32, 0.52]).
CONCLUSION: While there is broad consensus on classic indicators of severity such as left ventricular dysfunction as indication for intervention, guidelines diverge on other high-risk features warranting intervention. Early studies indicate the overall safety of early intervention, although further work is needed to identify whether it can reduce the risk of hard clinical endpoints. This underscores the need for further research and updated guidelines to clarify the optimal thresholds for intervention and harmonize treatment pathways for the growing number of patients with asymptomatic AS.","['Abbey J Grbac', 'Melissa G Y Lee', 'David Chye', 'Jennifer Y Zhou', 'Riley J Batchelor', 'Maximilian L E Steinfort', 'Sinjini Biswas', 'Ronen Gurvitch', 'William M Wilson', 'Andrew J Taylor', 'Jeffrey Lefkovits', ""Patrick T O'Gara"", 'Michael A Borger', 'Fabien Praz', 'Gilbert Hl Tang', 'Anoop N Koshy']",American heart journal,2025-04-15,10.1016/j.ahj.2025.04.012,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ahj.2025.04.012,,Paid,Management of asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis A critical review of guidelines and clinical outcomes GRBAC 2025,Not available,"['severe aortic stenosis', 'asymptomatic severe aortic', 'aortic stenosis', 'asymptomatic severe', 'severe aortic', 'critical review', 'asymptomatic', 'intervention', 'guidelines', 'severe']",2025-05-12,Pending,[]
40240085,Surgical Mitral Valve Repair vs Replacement After Failed Mitral Transcatheter Edge-to-Edge Repair: The CUTTING-EDGE Registry.,"BACKGROUND: The impact of mitral valve (MV) surgery type after failed mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (M-TEER) has not been well studied.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of MV repair vs replacement after failed M-TEER.
METHODS: From 2009 to 2020, a total of 332 patients across 34 centers from the CUTTING-EDGE registry underwent MV surgery after M-TEER. Outcomes were compared between MV repair and replacement. Primary outcomes included 30-day mortality and 1-year survival after MV surgery.
RESULTS: Among enrolled patients (mean age 73.8 ± 10.1 years, median Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality 3.9% [Q1-Q3: 2.2%-6.8%]), 25 (7.5%) underwent repair and 307 (92.5%) underwent replacement. The replacement group had a significantly higher rate of comorbidities, including atrial fibrillation, prior cardiac surgery, more secondary mitral regurgitation, and more devices implanted at index M-TEER (P < 0.05 for all). Replacement patients showed a trend toward higher 30-day mortality (17.7% [52 of 294] vs 4.0% [1 of 25]; P = 0.094). The observed-to-expected ratio of 30-day mortality was 3.6 (95% CI: 1.9-5.3) overall, 3.8 (95% CI: 2.1-5.5) in the replacement group, and 1.7 (95% CI: 0.7-3.3) in the repair group. Replacement patients had higher 1-year mortality (33.3% [65 of 195] vs 10.5% [2 of 19]; P = 0.041). Significantly lower survival rates were observed after replacement at 2 years (P = 0.033) and persisted in the risk-adjusted Cox regression analysis (HR for replacement: 4.24; 95% CI: 1.04-17.31; P = 0.044).
CONCLUSIONS: MV surgery after failed M-TEER is a high-risk procedure associated with higher than expected 30-day mortality, with higher mortality associated with MV replacement. Compared with repair, replacement is associated with higher 1-year mortality and a lower 2-year survival.","['Mateo Marin-Cuartas', 'Jagdip Kang', 'Thilo Noack', 'Manuela de la Cuesta', 'Markus Krane', 'Volkmar Falk', 'Lenard Conradi', 'Christian Hagl', 'Maurizio Taramasso', 'Tom C Nguyen', 'D Scott Lim', 'Gorav Ailawadi', 'Michael J Mack', 'Robert L Smith', 'Anita W Asgar', 'Kendra J Grubb', 'Luigi Pirelli', 'Paolo Denti', 'Thomas Modine', 'Michael J Reardon', 'Tamim M Nazif', 'Vinayak N Bapat', 'Tsuyoshi Kaneko', 'Philipp Kiefer', 'Michael A Borger', 'Gilbert H L Tang', 'Syed Zaid']",JACC.

40239910,Risk of delayed atrioventricular block in patients without procedural conduction disturbances during transcatheter aortic valve replacement.,"BACKGROUND: Among patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), the risk of delayed atrioventricular block (AVB) in those without procedural conduction disturbances (CDs) remains largely unknown. This may affect hospital stay, particularly same- or next-day discharge after the procedure.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the timing, type, and factors associated with delayed (up to 30 days) AVB in patients without procedural CDs.
METHODS: This was a subanalysis of the PROMOTE trial, a prospective multicenter study including consecutive patients without a prior pacemaker undergoing TAVR and with a prespecified strategy for managing CDs. Patients with no prior right bundle branch block and no procedural CDs were included in this study. Data on 30-day occurrence, timing of AVB, and timing of permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI) were collected in a dedicated database and analyzed overall and according to the preprocedural electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities (either first-degree AVB or abnormal QRS).
RESULTS: A total of 675 patients were included, 334 of whom (49.5%) exhibited baseline ECG abnormalities. At 30 days, 23 patients (3.4%) had delayed AVB (0.6% vs 6.3% in patients with normal and abnormal ECGs preprocedurally, respectively; P < .001). Most (74%) delayed AVB occurred on day 1 or 2 after the procedure. In the multivariable analysis, the factors associated with an increased rate of delayed AVB were preexisting abnormal ECG (odds ratio 5.28; 95% confidence interval 1.53-18.27; P = .009) and left ventricular ejection fraction < 50% (odds ratio 4.17; 95% confidence interval 1.75-9.93; P = .001). Among patients in sinus rhythm with a preprocedural abnormal ECG, those with QRS duration > 120 ms and first-degree AVB exhibited the highest risk (PPI rate 17.8%) followed by those with isolated QRS duration > 120 ms (PPI rate 8.7%).
CONCLUSION: Among TAVR recipients with no procedural CDs, those with an abnormal ECG preprocedurally represent a high-risk group for delayed AVB requiring PPI. This would support a tailored strategy, with a minimalist approach (same- or next-day discharge) in low-risk patients and more prolonged hospitalization or continuous ECG ambulatory monitoring in those at higher risk.

40230300,Impact of Elevated Preprocedural Left Ventricular Filling Pressure on Prognosis of Mild Paravalvular Regurgitation Following Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.,"BACKGROUND: Paravalvular regurgitation (PVR) following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a complication linked to poor outcomes. The prognostic impact of mild PVR, particularly in patients with elevated preprocedural left ventricular (LV) filling pressure, remains uncertain.
AIMS: This study aimed to assess the influence of elevated preprocedural LV filling pressure on mild PVR prognosis following TAVR.
METHODS: This single-center, retrospective study analyzed consecutive patients with severe aortic stenosis who underwent TAVR, excluding those with moderate or severe PVR. Preprocedural LV filling pressure was evaluated using baseline E/A ratio, and patients were stratified into four groups based on E/A ratio (≤1 or >1) and PVR severity (none/trace or mild). The primary endpoint was cardiovascular death within 5 years.
RESULTS: Among 904 patients, 466 had E/A ≤ 1 with none/trace PVR, 92 had E/A > 1 with none/trace PVR, 300 had E/A ≤ 1 with mild PVR, and 46 had E/A > 1 with mild PVR. Multivariable analysis identified E/A > 1 with mild PVR as an independent predictor of cardiovascular death (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 2.38; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.28-4.42; p < 0.01). In contrast, E/A > 1 with none/trace PVR (HR: 1.16, 95% CI: 0.66-2.03) and E/A ≤ 1 with mild PVR (HR: 1.33, 95% CI: 0.89-2.00) were not significant predictors compared to E/A ≤ 1 with none/trace PVR.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated preprocedural LV filling pressure is independently associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular death in patients with mild PVR following TAVR.","['Shumpei Kosugi', 'Isamu Mizote', 'Daisuke Nakamura', 'Hiroki Sugae', 'Yutaka Matsuhiro', 'Shota Okuno', 'Ai Kawamura', 'Kizuku Yamashita', 'Koichi Maeda', 'Kazuo Shimamura', 'Tomoharu Dohi', 'Yasuharu Takeda', 'Yasushi Sakata']",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,2025-04-15,10.1002/ccd.31537,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.31537,,Paid,Impact of Elevated Preprocedural Left Ventricular Filling Pressure on Prognosis of Mild Paravalvular Regurgitation Following Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement KOSUGI 2025,Not available,"['Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Mild Paravalvular Regurgitation', 'Preprocedural Left Ventricular', 'Elevated Preprocedural Left', 'mild PVR', 'Paravalvular Regurgitation', 'Valve Replacement', 'PVR', 'Elevated Preprocedural']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['E/A ratio', 'aortic stenosis', 'brain natriuretic peptide', 'left ventricular filling pressure', 'paravalvular regurgitation', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"

METHODS: We identified heart team-designated low-risk patients undergoing TAVR for trileaflet severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons/American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Registry, as well as a subset of patients who met low-risk trial inclusion and exclusion criteria, from January 2020 to March 2024. Outcomes (mortality, stroke, new pacemaker, and ""alive and well,"" defined as alive at 1 year with Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire score ≥60 and ≤10-point decrease from baseline) at 30 days and 1 year were assessed. Multivariable models were developed to assess predictors of death and stroke within 1 year after TAVR.
RESULTS: Among 383 030 patients who underwent TAVR during the study period, 108 407 (28%) were designated low-risk by the heart team, and 68 194 (18%) met other study inclusion and exclusion criteria. Of these, 62% (n=42 093) would have been eligible for the low-risk trials. In the overall heart team-designated low-risk population, 30-day outcomes included 0.8% mortality, 1.5% stroke, and 8.4% new permanent pacemaker requirement; 1-year outcomes included 4.6% mortality, 2.6% stroke, and 90% alive and well. In the trial-eligible population, 0.6% mortality, 1.4% stroke, and 8.0% new permanent pacemaker requirement had occurred by 30 days; values at 1 year included 3.1% mortality, 2.4% stroke, and 92% alive and well. Notable multivariable predictors of 1-year mortality were atrial fibrillation, nontransfemoral access, and lower baseline Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire score.
CONCLUSIONS: One-year outcomes among real-world trial-eligible patients are excellent, but adverse events are higher compared with published clinical trial data, likely because of greater comorbidity burden and lower baseline Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire score. These data can help inform expected outcomes and health status after low-risk TAVR.","['Andrew M Vekstein', 'Zachary K Wegermann', 'Pratik Manandhar', 'Michael J Mack', 'David J Cohen', 'G Chad Hughes', 'J Kevin Harrison', 'Tsuyoshi Kaneko', 'Samir R Kapadia', 'Konstantinos Stathogiannis', 'William F Fearon', 'Suzanne Arnold', 'Andrzej S Kosinski', 'Martin B Leon', 'Wayne B Batchelor', 'Vinod H Thourani', 'Sreekanth Vemulapalli']",Circulation,2025-04-22,10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.124.071838,https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.124.071838,,Paid,Outcomes of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Low Risk Patients in the United States A Report From the STS/ACC TVT Registry VEKSTEIN 2025,Not available,"['ACC TVT Registry', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'ACC TVT', 'Transcatheter Valve Registry', 'United States', 'City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire', 'Cardiology Transcatheter Valve', 'Kansas City Cardiomyopathy', 'TVT Registry']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['aortic valve stenosis', 'quality of life', 'risk', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"
40174596,"Orbital atherectomy versus balloon angioplasty before drug-eluting stent implantation in severely calcified lesions eligible for both treatment strategies (ECLIPSE): a multicentre, open-label, randomised trial.","BACKGROUND: Coronary artery calcification is common among patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and severe coronary artery lesion calcification is associated with increased procedural complexity, stent under-expansion, and high rates of intraprocedural complications and out-of-hospital adverse events. Whether calcium ablation before stent implantation can mitigate these adverse events is not currently established. We aimed to prospectively compare orbital atherectomy with a balloon angioplasty-based strategy before stent implantation for the treatment of severely calcified coronary lesions.
METHODS: In this multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial conducted at 104 medical centres in the USA, patients (aged ≥18 years) with severely calcified coronary lesions were randomly assigned (1:1) to orbital atherectomy or balloon angioplasty before PCI with drug-eluting stents using a web-based system (block sizes of four and six) and stratified by intended treatment of single versus multiple lesions and enrolling site. Randomly assigned lesions were deemed by operators to be eligible for both treatment strategies. Operators and patients were not masked to treatment. The two powered coprimary study endpoints were target vessel failure at 1 year (a composite of cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction, or ischaemia-driven target vessel revascularisation) and post-procedural minimal stent area at the site of maximal calcification, as assessed by intravascular optical coherence tomography in an imaging patient cohort. Primary analyses were by intention-to-treat. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.govNCT03108456, and 2-year follow-up is ongoing.
FINDINGS: From March 27, 2017, to April 13, 2023, 2005 patients with 2492 lesions were randomly assigned to lesion preparation with orbital atherectomy (1008 patients with 1250 lesions) or balloon angioplasty (997 with 1242 lesions) before stent implantation. Median patient age was 70·0 years (IQR 64·0-76·0). 541 (27·0%) of 2005 patients were female and 1464 (73·0%) were male. Angiographically severe calcium was confirmed by the core laboratory in 1088 (97·1%) of 1120 lesions assigned to orbital atherectomy and 1068 (97·0%) of 1101 lesions assigned to balloon angioplasty. PCI was guided by intravascular imaging in 627 (62·2%) of 1008 patients in the orbital atherectomy group and 619 (62·1%) of 997 in the balloon angioplasty group. Target vessel failure events within 1 year occurred in 113 of 1008 patients in the orbital atherectomy group (1-year target vessel failure 11·5% [95% CI 9·7 to 13·7]) and in 97 of 997 patients in the balloon angioplasty group (10·0% [8·3 to 12·1]; absolute difference 1·5% [96% CI -1·4 to 4·4]; hazard ratio 1·16 [96% CI 0·87 to 1·54], p=0·28). Among those in the optical coherence tomography substudy cohort (276 patients with 286 lesions in the orbital atherectomy group and 279 patients with 292 lesions in the balloon angioplasty group), the mean minimal stent area at the site of maximal calcification was 7·67 mm2 (SD 2·27) in the orbital atherectomy group and 7·42 mm2 (2·54) in the balloon angioplasty group (mean difference 0·26 [99% CI -0·31 to 0·82]; p=0·078). Cardiac death events within 1 year occurred in 39 of 1008 patients in the orbital atherectomy group and in 26 of 997 in the balloon angioplasty group.
INTERPRETATION: Routine treatment with orbital atherectomy before drug-eluting stent implantation did not increase minimal stent area or reduce the rate of target vessel failure at 1 year compared with a balloon angioplasty-based approach in severely calcified lesions deemed eligible for both treatment strategies. These data support a balloon-first approach for most calcified coronary artery lesions that can be crossed and dilated before stent implantation, guided by intravascular imaging.

40158212,5-Year Outcomes After Transcatheter or Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement in Low-Risk Patients With Aortic Stenosis.,"BACKGROUND: The Evolut Low Risk trial demonstrated that transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) was noninferior to surgery for the primary endpoint of all-cause mortality or disabling stroke at 2 years. Outcomes at 5 years have not been reported.
OBJECTIVES: This study sought to evaluate 5-year clinical and hemodynamic outcomes with TAVR vs surgery in patients from the Evolut Low Risk trial.
METHODS: We randomly assigned low-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis to TAVR or surgery. The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause mortality or disabling stroke. Secondary endpoints included clinical, echocardiographic, and quality-of-life outcomes through 5 years.
RESULTS: A total of 1,414 patients underwent an attempted implant (n = 730 TAVR, n = 684 surgery). The mean age was 74 years (range 51-88 years), and women accounted for 35% of patients. At 5 years the Kaplan-Meier estimate for the primary endpoint of all-cause mortality or disabling stroke was 15.5% for the TAVR group and 16.4% for the surgery group (P = 0.47). The Kaplan-Meier estimates in the TAVR and surgery groups for all-cause mortality were 13.5% and 14.9% (P = 0.39) and for disabling stroke were 3.6% and 4.0% (P = 0.57). Cardiovascular mortality was 7.2% in the TAVR group and 9.3% in the surgery group (P = 0.15). Noncardiovascular mortality in the TAVR group was 6.8% and 6.2% in the surgery group (P = 0.73). A site-level vital status sweep was performed for patients who were lost to follow-up or withdrew from the study. With the addition of these patients, the all-cause mortality rate at 5 years for patients undergoing TAVR was 14.7% and for surgery was 15.2% (P = 0.74). Over 5 years, valve reintervention rate was 3.3% for TAVR and 2.5% for surgery (P = 0.44). A sustained improvement in quality of life was observed in both treatment arms with mean Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire summary score of 88.3 ± 15.8 in TAVR and 88.5 ± 15.8 in surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: At 5 years, patients with severe aortic stenosis who were treated with either TAVR or surgery had comparable rates of all-cause mortality or disabling stroke. Valve durability and performance were excellent in both arms. This midterm evaluation reinforces the position of TAVR as noninferior to surgery in patients with severe aortic stenosis at low surgical risk (Medtronic Evolut Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Low Risk Patients; NCT02701283).","['John K Forrest', 'Steven J Yakubov', 'G Michael Deeb', 'Hemal Gada', 'Mubashir A Mumtaz', 'Basel Ramlawi', 'Tanvir Bajwa', 'John Crouch', 'William Merhi', 'Stephane Leung Wai Sang', 'Neal S Kleiman', 'George Petrossian', 'Newell B Robinson', 'Paul Sorajja', 'Ayman Iskander', 'Pierre Berthoumieu', 'Didier Tchétché', 'Christopher Feindel', 'Eric M Horlick', 'Shigeru Saito', 'Jae K Oh', 'Yoojin Jung', 'Michael J Reardon']",Journal of the American College of Cardiology,2025-04-22,10.1016/j.jacc.2025.03.004,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2025.03.004,,Paid,5 Year Outcomes After Transcatheter or Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement in Low Risk Patients With Aortic Stenosis FORREST 2025,Not available,"['Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Evolut Low Risk', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'Evolut Transcatheter Aortic', 'TAVR', 'Low Risk', 'Low Risk trial', 'Valve Replacement', 'transcatheter aortic', 'Medtronic Evolut Transcatheter']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['TAVR', 'aortic stenosis', 'low-risk', 'supra-annular self-expanding', 'surgery']"

40117414,Temporal Trends in 1-Year Cause-Specific Mortality After TAVR: Insights From the STS/ACC TVT Registry.,"BACKGROUND: The impact of changing patient demographics and risk profiles on cause-specific mortality after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) remains unclear.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine causes of death (CoDs) and temporal trends and predictors of cause-specific mortality after TAVR.
METHODS: Data from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons/American College of Cardiology TVT (Transcatheter Valve Therapy) Registry were analyzed to identify patients who underwent isolated TAVR between January 2012 and October 2022 who had available information on 1-year CoD. The primary outcome was cause-specific (cardiac and noncardiac) mortality at 1 year. Fine and Gray subdistribution hazard models were used to account for the competing risk for cause-specific death.
RESULTS: Of 36,877 patients who died within 1 year after TAVR and had available information on CoD, 11,560 (31.3%) had cardiac death and 25,317 (68.7%) had noncardiac death. There was an initial decline in the risk-adjusted hazards of 1-year cardiac and noncardiac death after TAVR from 2012 to 2017 (adjusted HR per year: 0.95 [95% CI: 0.92-0.97] and 0.92 [95% CI: 0.90-0.93], respectively), followed by an increase from 2018 to 2022 (adjusted HR per year: 1.07 [95% CI: 1.05-1.09] and 1.22 [95% CI: 1.20-1.24], respectively). Age >80 years, comorbidities, poor functional status, nonelective procedure, nonfemoral access, and in-hospital complications were identified as independent predictors of both cardiac and noncardiac death after TAVR.
CONCLUSIONS: Noncardiac causes account for two-thirds of deaths within 1 year after TAVR. Further studies are needed to examine whether the COVID-19 pandemic, the rapid expansion in the number of TAVR sites, or other patient and hospital characteristics contributed to the increased risk for cardiac and noncardiac death after TAVR in recent years.","['Dhaval Kolte', 'Guillaume Marquis-Gravel', 'Amanda Stebbins', 'Andrew M Vekstein', 'Sreekanth Vemulapalli', 'Sammy Elmariah']",JACC.

40102102,Australian Cardiac Outcomes Registry of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation: Report and Update of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation in Australia.,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) procedures performed in Australia are recorded in the national Australian Cardiac Outcomes Registry (ACOR) TAVI Registry. Characteristics of patients and operators are prospectively collected with reference to patient demographics, procedural factors as well as outcomes related to both efficacy and safety metrics.
METHODS: Patient level data reported to the ACOR TAVI Registry from enrolled sites from registry inception up until 31 December 2021 were analysed. Key safety and efficacy metrics were identified and used to assess TAVI performance and outcomes in the Australian setting.
RESULTS: From 10 April 2018 to 31 December 2021, 9,881 consecutive patients underwent a TAVI procedure in Australia across 42 TAVI hospitals. The mean age of patients treated was 81.8 years (± standard deviation [SD] 7.1 years), 40.6% were female and the mean STS (Society for Thoracic Surgeons) score was 5.3% (±SD 4.4%). Overall, 0.3% of the cohort identified as Australian Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander peoples. All-cause mortality at 30 days and 12 months was 1.37% and 5.57% respectively. The 30-day rates of stroke, major vascular complications and newly implanted permanent pacemaker were 2.19%, 1.23% and 10.68% respectively. There were 181 unique primary operators who performed TAVI during this time with an annualised median number of 19 procedures per operator per year (interquartile range [IQR] 42.5) and 63% of operators performed <30 cases per year.

40071304,Cerebral Protection Devices in Case of Left Sided Intracardiac Thrombus: A Multicentre Experience From the Cath Lab and EP Lab.,"BACKGROUND: Performing a left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) or catheter ablation with left-sided intracardiac thrombus is considered very-high risk for periinterventional stroke. Cerebral embolic protection (CEP) devices are designed to prevent cardioembolic stroke and have been widely studied in TAVR procedures. However, their role in LAAO and catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia (VT) or in pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) with cardiac thrombus present remains unknown.
PURPOSE: to study utility and safety of CEP devices during LAAO and catheter ablation in patients with left sided intracardiac thrombus in a multicenter setting.
METHODS: Two different CEP devices were used according to the physician's discretion: (1) a capture device consisting of two filters for the brachiocephalic and left common carotid arteries placed from a radial artery; or (2) a deflection device covering all three supra-aortic vessels placed over a femoral artery. Periprocedural and safety data from 2019 to 2023 were retrospectively obtained from procedural reports and discharge letters for all patients with left-sided intracardiac thrombus undergoing LAAO, VT ablation, or PVI under protection with a CEP device. Long-term safety data were obtained by clinical follow-up in the respective institutions and telephone consultations.
RESULTS: Sixty-five patients were enrolled in five centers in Italy. Fifty-two patients underwent LAA closure, 12 patients underwent VT ablation and one patient underwent PVI. Mean age was 73 ± 10 years and 43 (66%) were male, mean LVEF was 46 ± 13%. The location of the cardiac thrombus was the LAA in all 52 patients (100%) undergoing LAA closure whereas in patients undergoing VT ablation, thrombus was present in the LAA in five cases (42%), left ventricle (n = 6; 50%) and aortic arch (n = 1;8%). One patient developed left atrial thrombus during PVI. The capture device was used in 39 out of 65 (60%) and the deflection device in 26 out of 65 cases (40%). There were no periprocedural strokes or transitory ischemic attacks (TIA). CEP-related complications at the arterial access site were noted in 4 cases (6%) and were minor, not requiring surgery. Other periprocedural events were one transient ST-elevation caused by coronary spasm in a patient undergoing LAA closure, not related to the CEP device. There was one in-hospital death after VT ablation due to cardiogenic shock, not related to the CEP device. At long-term follow-up, one TIA and three non-cardiovascular deaths occurred with a mean follow-up time of 455 days.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first multicentre experience showing that LAA closure or catheter ablation with cerebral protection in patients with cardiac thrombus is feasible without thromboembolic complications. The possibility of safely performing an intervention in this high-risk setting is promising and should be tested in a prospective randomized trial.","['Patrizio Mazzone', 'Alberto Preda', 'Giacomo Giovanni Boccuzzi', 'Andrea Montabone', ""Andrea Dell'Aquila"", 'Nicolai Fierro', 'Alessandra Marzi', 'Andrea Radinovic', 'Arianna Giannitto', 'Fabrizio Ugo', 'Paolo Della Bella', 'Jan Berg']",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,2025-05-12,10.1002/ccd.31487,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.31487,,Paid,Cerebral Protection Devices in Case of Left Sided Intracardiac Thrombus A Multicentre Experience From the Cath Lab and EP Lab MAZZONE 2025,Not available,"['Cath Lab', 'Sided Intracardiac Thrombus', 'Left Sided Intracardiac', 'Intracardiac Thrombus', 'CEP device', 'Lab', 'left-sided intracardiac thrombus', 'CEP', 'Thrombus', 'LAA closure']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['EMBP—embolic protection devices', 'LAA—closure', 'STR—stroke', 'ablation', 'catheter/cryoblation/RF']"

40007245,Aortic Root Anatomy and Impact on New-Onset Left Bundle Branch Block After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.,"BACKGROUND: Angulation of virtual basal ring (VBR), also known as aortic annulus, in relation to sino-tubular junction (STJ) may lead to greater exposure of implanted stent to the conduction system, consequently increasing the risk of left bundle branch block (LBBB).
AIMS: We sough to measure the VBR-STJ angle and explore its impact on the development of LBBB post-TAVR.
METHODS: Patients undergoing TAVR using the Sapiens 3 valve between 2016 and 2021, without pre-TAVR conduction anomalies were included. The angle between the VBR and the ascending aorta was measured as the angle between the VBR plane and the plane of the STJ on cardiac CT, along with the annulus dimensions. TAVR implantation depth was measured on fluoroscopy images.
RESULTS: A total of 1204 patients were included, with 145 having new-onset LBBB. The VBR-STJ angle was significantly greater in the new-onset LBBB group (7.3 ± 4.7 vs. 5.9 ± 4.6, p = 0.002), and the difference in implantation depth between the levels of right and none coronary cusp (RCC and NCC) was significantly correlated with the VBR-STJ angle (r = 0.3, p = 0.03). This angle was further associated with new-onset LBBB after adjustment to patient and procedural characteristics (OR 1.08 CI: [1.04, 1.13], p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Patients developing LBBB have larger VBR-STJ angle which was associated with greater depth of implantation of the TAVR valve below the RCC compared to the NCC. Precise understanding of the aortic root anatomy can help to predict onset of LBBB which in turn can inform decision-making regarding optimal way of treating aortic stenosis and may improve procedure planning.","['Habib Layoun', 'Joseph Kassab', 'Michel Chedid El Helou', 'Joseph El Dahdah', 'Odette Iskandar', 'Maryam Muhammad Ali Majeed Saidan', 'Abdelrahman Abushouk', 'Toshiaki Isogai', 'Grant Reed', 'Rishi Puri', 'Oussama M Wazni', 'Amar Krishnaswamy', 'Serge Harb', 'Samir Kapadia']",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,2025-05-12,10.1002/ccd.31434,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.31434,PMC12057298,Free,Aortic Root Anatomy and Impact on New Onset Left Bundle Branch Block After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation LAYOUN 2025,pdfs\Aortic Root Anatomy and Impact on New Onset Left Bundle Branch Block After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation LAYOUN 2025.pdf,"['LBBB', 'TAVR', 'Left Bundle Branch', 'Aortic Root Anatomy', 'Bundle Branch Block', 'onset LBBB', 'VBR', 'STJ angle', 'Patients undergoing TAVR', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['aortic root', 'left bundle branch block', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"
39981654,Impact of Continuation Versus Interruption of Oral Anticoagulation During TAVI on Health-Related Quality of Life.,"BACKGROUND: One-third of patients undergoing TAVR have a concomitant indication for oral anticoagulation. The impact of continuation as compared to interruption of oral anticoagulation during TAVR on health-related quality of life is unknown.
AIMS: To investigate the impact of continuation as compared to interruption of oral anticoagulation on health-related quality of life.
METHODS: The POPular PAUSE TAVI (Periprocedural Continuation vs. Interruption of Oral Anticoagulant Drugs during Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation) trial was an international, open-label, randomized, clinical trial performed at 22 European sites. Health-related quality of life was assessed using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) and Short Form-12 (SF-12) before, and at 1 and 3 months after TAVR.
RESULTS: A total of 8 patients were included: 431 were assigned to continuation and 427 to interruption of oral anticoagulation. Before TAVR, the mean overall KCCQ summary score was 53.6 (±26.0). At 1 month, the mean change in KCCQ summary score as compared to baseline was +11.4 points (95% confidence interval [CI] 8.0-14.8) in the continuation group and +12.2 points (95% CI 8.8-15.6) in the interruption group (difference -0.7 points; 95% CI -4.6 to 3.1). At 3 months, the mean change was +11.0 points (95% CI 7.3-14.6) versus +13.8 points (95% CI 10.2-17.4), respectively (difference -2.8 points; 95% CI -7.1 to 1.5). Mean changes in SF-12 physical and mental component summary scores showed no differences between both groups at 1 and 3 months after TAVR.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing TAVR with a concomitant indication for oral anticoagulation, continuation as compared to interruption of oral anticoagulation during TAVR did not significantly impact health-related quality of life up to 3 months after TAVR.","['Dirk Jan van Ginkel', 'Willem L Bor', 'Hugo M Aarts', 'Christophe Dubois', 'Ole De Backer', 'Maxim J P Rooijakkers', 'Liesbeth Rosseel', 'Leo Veenstra', 'Ronak Delewi', 'Jurriën M Ten Berg']",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,2025-05-12,10.1002/ccd.31457,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.31457,,Paid,Impact of Continuation Versus Interruption of Oral Anticoagulation During TAVI on Health Related Quality of Life GINKEL 2025,Not available,"['Oral Anticoagulation', 'Interruption of Oral', 'Quality of Life', 'Health-Related Quality', 'Oral', 'TAVR', 'Anticoagulation', 'Oral Anticoagulant Drugs', 'Interruption', 'impact health-related quality']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['KCCQ', 'TAVI', 'anticoagulation', 'bleeding', 'quality of life', 'stroke']"
39965432,Machine learning for predicting outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve implantation: A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) therapy has demonstrated its clear benefits such as low invasiveness, to treat aortic stenosis. Despite associated benefits, still post-procedural complications might occur. The severity of these complications depends on pre-existing clinical conditions and patient specific complex anatomical features. Accurate prediction of TAVI outcomes will assist in the precise risk assessment for patients undergoing TAVI. Throughout the past decade, different machine learning (ML) approaches have been utilized to predict outcomes of TAVI. This systematic review aims to assess the application of ML in TAVI for the purpose of outcome prediction.
METHODS: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline was adapted for searching the PubMed and Scopus databases on ML use in TAVI outcomes prediction. Once the studies that meet the inclusion criteria were identified, data from these studies were retrieved and were further examined. 17 parameters relevant to TAVI outcomes were carefully identified for assessing the quality of the included studies.
RESULTS: Following the search of the mentioned databases, 78 studies were initially retrieved, and 17 of these studies were included for further assessment. Most of the included studies focused on mortality prediction, utilizing datasets of varying sizes and diverse ML algorithms. The most employed ML algorithms were random forest, logistics regression, and gradient boosting. Among the studied parameters, serum creatinine, age, BMI, hemoglobin, and aortic valve mean gradient were identified as key predictors for TAVI outcomes. These predictors were found to be well aligned with established associations in current literature.
CONCLUSION: ML presents a promising opportunity for improving the success and safety of TAVI and enhancing patient-centered care. While currently retrospective studies with low generalizability and heterogeneity form the basis of ML TAVI research, future prospective investigations with highly heterogeneous patient TAVI cohorts will be critically important for firmly establishing the applicability of ML in predicting TAVI outcomes.","['Ruba Sulaiman', 'Md Ahasan Atick Faisal', 'Maram Hasan', 'Muhammad E H Chowdhury', 'Faycal Bensaali', 'Abdulrahman Alnabti', 'Huseyin C Yalcin']",International journal of medical informatics,2025-05-12,10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2025.105840,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2025.105840,,Paid,Machine learning for predicting outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve implantation A systematic review SULAIMAN 2025,Not available,"['transcatheter aortic valve', 'aortic valve implantation', 'TAVI outcomes', 'TAVI', 'transcatheter aortic', 'aortic valve', 'valve implantation', 'TAVI outcomes prediction', 'outcomes', 'aortic']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Aortic stenosis', 'Deep learning', 'Machine learning', 'Outcome prediction', 'TAVI', 'TAVR', 'Transcatheter aortic valve implantation']"

Patients with C-LFLG AS have a higher mortality rate after TAVR than those with HG AS. However, what leads to C-LFLG AS and the predictors of mortality in this population remain unclear. In this retrospective, single-center study involving 1,415 patients with severe AS, patients were classified as having (1) HG AS (aortic valve mean gradient [MG] >40 mm Hg), (2) C-LFLG AS (MG <40 mm Hg, stroke volume index <35 ml/m2, left ventricular ejection fraction <50%), and (3) NFLG AS (MG <40 mm Hg, stroke volume index ≥35 ml/m2, left ventricular ejection fraction ≥50%). Logistic regression was used for predictors of C-LFLG AS. Cox regression was used for predictors of mortality in the C-LFLG AS population. Male gender, multiple co-morbidities, and moderate to severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation correlated with the C-LFLG AS group. Patients with C-LFLG AS had a higher mortality risk compared with patients with HG AS at 2 years after TAVR. Patients with NFLG AS had similar mortality at 1 year, but higher mortality at 2 years after TAVR compared with patients with HG AS. End-stage renal disease, atrial fibrillation, and other co-morbidities were predictors of 2-year mortality in patients with C-LFLG AS. In conclusion, the mortality rate after TAVR was higher among patients with C-LFLG AS than those with HG AS. Male gender and multiple co-morbidities were predictors of C-LFLG AS. Multiple co-morbidities were predictors of mortality among those patients.","['Besir Besir', 'Shivabalan Kathavarayan Ramu', 'Maryam Muhammad Ali Majeed-Saidan', 'Judah Rajendran', 'Odette Iskandar', 'Grant Reed', 'Rishi Puri', 'James Yun', 'Serge Harb', 'Rhonda Miyasaka', 'Amar Krishnaswamy', 'Zoran Popovic', 'Samir R Kapadia']",The American journal of cardiology,2025-05-01,10.1016/j.amjcard.2025.01.019,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjcard.2025.01.019,,Paid,Outcomes and Predictors of Different Flow Gradient Patterns of Aortic Stenosis After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement BESIR 2025,Not available,"['Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Aortic Stenosis', 'Aortic Valve', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'C-LFLG', 'Valve Replacement', 'Aortic', 'Patients', 'mortality']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['aortic stenosis', 'classical low-flow low-gradient (C-LFLG) AS', 'high-gradient (HG) AS', 'normal-flow low-gradient (NFLG) AS', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR)']"

39710301,Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Aortic Stenosis Patients With New York Heart Association Functional Class III or IV.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with symptomatic aortic stenosis are a vulnerable population with associated cardiac damage and a significant comorbidity burden. In this study we aimed to determine the rate, factors associated with, and prognostic value of poor functional status (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class III-IV) in patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
METHODS: This multicenter study included 6363 transarterial TAVR patients, classified according to baseline functional status (NYHA class I or II vs III or IV).
RESULTS: A total of 3800 (60%) patients presented with NYHA class III or IV before the TAVR procedure. Atrial fibrillation (odds ratio [OR], 1.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-1.58; P = 0.002), chronic kidney disease (CKD; OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.45-2.05; P < 0.001), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; OR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.32-2.05; P < 0.001), reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (OR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.70-3.05; P < 0.001), and moderate and severe pulmonary hypertension were associated with a poor functional status. At 1-year follow-up, patients with NYHA class III or IV had higher rates of mortality (8.81 per 100 person-years [95% CI, 7.57-10.15] vs 13.12 per 100 person-years [95% CI, 11.80-14.58]; log rank, P < 0.001) and heart failure hospitalization (8.25 per 100 person-years [95% CI, 7.05-9.65] vs 12.5 per 100 person-years [95% CI, 11.24-14.00]; log rank, P = 0.005). Comorbidity factors (COPD, CKD) and signs of cardiac damage (atrial fibrillation, pulmonary hypertension) determined an increased risk of poorer clinical outcomes (P < 0.01 for all).
CONCLUSIONS: More than half of the patients undergoing TAVR in the contemporary era have presented with advanced functional class before the procedure, and this was associated with a greater comorbidity and cardiac damage burden. Patients with poorer baseline functional status exhibited worse clinical outcomes at 1-year follow-up. These findings highlight the need for further study on earlier interventions for patients with aortic stenosis.","['Jorge Nuche', 'Jules Mesnier', 'Julien Ternacle', 'Effat Rezaei', 'Francisco Campelo-Parada', 'Marina Urena', 'Gabriela Veiga-Fernandez', 'Luis Nombela-Franco', 'Anna Franzone', 'Antonio J Munoz-Garcia', 'Victoria Vilalta', 'Ander Regueiro', 'David Del Val', 'Lluis Asmarats', 'Maria Del Trigo', 'Vicenç Serra', 'Guillaume Bonnet', 'Melchior Jonveaux', 'Ronan Canitrot', 'Dominique Himbert', 'Jose Maria de la Torre Hernandez', 'Gabriela Tirado-Conte', 'Eduard Fernandez-Nofrerias', 'Pedro Cepas', 'Fernando Alfonso', 'Lola Gutierrez-Alonso', 'Juan Francisco Oteo', 'Yassin Belahnech', 'Siamak Mohammadi', 'Thomas Modine', 'Marisa Avvedimento', 'Josep Rodés-Cabau', 'Asim N Cheema']",The Canadian journal of cardiology,2025-05-12,10.1016/j.cjca.2024.12.025,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2024.12.025,,Paid,Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Aortic Stenosis Patients With New York Heart Association Functional Class III or IV NUCHE 2025,Not available,"['York Heart Association', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'NYHA class III', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Aortic Stenosis', 'Heart Association Functional', 'York Heart', 'Heart Association', 'Association Functional Class', 'Class III']",2025-05-12,Pending,[]
39667494,Clinical Outcomes in Atrial Fibrillation Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement With Contemporary Devices.,"BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) has been identified as a marker of advanced cardiac damage in patients with aortic stenosis. However, the factors associated with poorer outcomes among AF patients in contemporary transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) practice, particularly regarding mortality and heart failure (HF)-related hospitalizations, remain largely unknown.
METHODS: In this multicenter study, we assessed consecutive patients with a history of AF and evaluated the clinical outcomes of those who underwent TAVR with newer generation devices using either balloon- or self-expandable valves.
RESULTS: A total of 3476 patients were included in the study. After a median follow-up of 2 (interquartile range, 1-4) years, 36.1% patients had died, with 51.5% of deaths being cardiovascular-related, including 15.6% from HF. HF-related hospitalizations post-TAVR accounted for 34.8% of all hospitalizations and were associated with a higher mortality risk (hazard ratio [HR], 1.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.32-1.81; P < 0.001). Permanent AF was identified as an independent predictor of all-cause mortality or HF-related hospitalizations (HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.10-1.40; P < 0.001), as did other baseline characteristics, including chronic kidney disease (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.09-1.38; P = 0.001), anemia (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.07-1.36; P = 0.002), and New York Heart Association functional class III or IV (HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.01-1.27; P = 0.045). In addition, early postprocedural complications, including stroke and bleeding, also significantly increased the risk of mortality (HR, 5.52; 95% CI, 3.12-9.79; P < 0.001) and HF-related hospitalizations (HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.03-1.33; P = 0.014).
CONCLUSIONS: AF patients exhibited a high risk of mortality and HF-related hospitalizations in a contemporary TAVR cohort. Several baseline comorbidities and periprocedural complications, along with permanent (vs paroxysmal) AF, were associated with poorer outcomes. These findings confirm the negative impact of AF despite the continued improvements in TAVR technology and underscore the importance of early intervention and optimization of HF management to improve outcomes in this high-risk population.","['Siddhartha Mengi', 'Pedro Cepas-Guillén', 'Julien Ternacle', 'Marina Urena', 'Alberto Alperi', 'Asim N Cheema', 'Gabriela Veiga-Fernandez', 'Luis Nombela-Franco', 'Victoria Vilalta', 'Giovanni Esposito', 'Francisco Campelo-Parada', 'Ciro Indolfi', 'Maria Del Trigo', 'Antonio Muñoz-Garcia', 'Nicolas Maneiro', 'Lluís Asmarats', 'Ander Regueiro', 'David Del Val', 'Vicenç Serra', 'Vincent Auffret', 'Lionel Leroux', 'Thomas Modine', 'Jules Mesnier', 'Gaspard Suc', 'Pablo Avanzas', 'Effat Rezaei', 'Victor Fradejas-Sastre', 'Gabriela Tirado-Conte', 'Eduard Fernández-Nofrerias', 'Domenico Angellotti', 'Thibaut Guitteny', 'Sabato Sorrentino', 'Juan Francisco Oteo', 'Felipe Díez-Delhoyo', 'Lola Gutiérrez-Alonso', 'Pablo Vidal-Calés', 'Fernando Alfonso', 'Andrea Monastyrski', 'Maxime Nolf', 'Marisa Avvedimento', 'Josep Rodés-Cabau']",The Canadian journal of cardiology,2025-05-12,10.1016/j.cjca.2024.12.007,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2024.12.007,,Paid,Clinical Outcomes in Atrial Fibrillation Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement With Contemporary Devices MENGI 2025,Not available,"['Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic', 'Fibrillation Patients Undergoing', 'Patients Undergoing Transcatheter', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Atrial Fibrillation Patients', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Undergoing Transcatheter', 'contemporary transcatheter aortic', 'Patients Undergoing']",2025-05-12,Pending,[]
39667492,Four-dimensional Cardiac Modelling of Multiphase Computed Tomography for Predicting Outcomes After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.,"BACKGROUND: Multiphase computed tomography angiography (mpCTA) is routinely performed prior to transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) to determine eligibility and enable preprocedural planning. Incremental prognostic value may be realized from full-cycle, multiphase reconstructions to assess the contractile health of the cardiac chambers. In this study we assessed the feasibility of 4-dimensional chamber modelling of the left ventricle (LV) to support 3-dimensional minimum principal strain (3DminPS)-based predictions of clinical outcomes after TAVR.
METHODS: Two hundred five patients undergoing pre-TAVR mpCTA were studied. UNet-based 3D chamber segmentation was followed by mesh modelling and 3D feature tracking-based deformation to determine global 3DminPS for endocardial, epicardial, and transmural layers. Independent associations of 3DminPS with the primary outcome of heart failure hospitalization or death are described.
RESULTS: Of the 205 patients studied, 196 (96%) had analyzable mpCTAs (median age, 85 years; 55% male; Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality score = 3.10; 60.0% echocardiographic LV ejection fraction). At a median of 25 months after TAVR, 55 patients (28%) experienced the primary outcome. After adjustment for baseline variables, patients with an endocardial 3DminPS amplitude worse than -23.7% experienced a 2.7-fold higher risk of the outcome (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-5.1; P = 0.001), with this high-risk cohort having 1- and 3-year event rates of 32% and 49%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Four-dimensional chamber modelling of mpCTA using UNet-based segmentation and standardized mesh deformation is feasible and enables delivery of 3D deformation markers with strong prognostic value for the prediction of outcomes after TAVR. Prospective validation in a multicentre setting is currently being undertaken.","['Mohamad Rabbani', 'Ali Fatehi Hassanabad', 'Alessandro Satriano', 'Dina Labib', 'Carmen P Lydell', 'Michael Bristow', 'Anna Bizios', 'Corey Adams', 'Muhammad Mustafa Alhussein', 'Steven Dykstra', 'Jacqueline Flewitt', 'Sandra Rivest', 'William Kent', 'Zhiying Liang', 'Tianqi Tao', 'Andrew G Howarth', 'Elena Di Martino', 'Nowell M Fine', 'Michael W A Chu', 'James A White']",The Canadian journal of cardiology,2025-05-12,10.1016/j.cjca.2024.12.008,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2024.12.008,,Paid,Four dimensional Cardiac Modelling of Multiphase Computed Tomography for Predicting Outcomes After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement RABBANI 2025,Not available,"['Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Multiphase Computed Tomography', 'Valve Replacement', 'computed tomography angiography', 'Aortic Valve', 'Computed Tomography', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'Multiphase Computed', 'Predicting Outcomes']",2025-05-12,Pending,[]
39667491,Clinical Outcomes of Patients With Bicuspid Aortic Valve Undergoing a Targeted Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Approach: The LIRA Method.,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in patients with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) disease is still burdened by a non-negligible rate of stroke and permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI). These suboptimal results, possibly related to the unique BAV anatomy, may suggest the use of a different sizing method in this setting. The aim of our study is to evaluate whether the application of the supra-annular LIRA method may improve clinical outcomes in this population.
METHODS: In this single-center retrospective study, we enrolled consecutive patients with severe aortic stenosis and raphe-type BAV undergone TAVR with the implantation of supra-annular self-expanding prostheses sized according to the LIRA method. The primary endpoint was the device success. Secondary endpoints were in-hospital and 30-day safety outcomes and 1-year clinical efficacy. All study endpoints were adjudicated according to the Valve Academic Research Consortium 3 criteria.
RESULTS: A total of 104 patients (mean age, 79.8 ± 5.83 years) were enrolled in our study. The mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons score was 4.96 ± 4.73%. Use of the LIRA method led to prosthesis downsizing in 85.6% of patients. Device success was 94.2%. All-cause death was 0%, conversion to surgery was 0%, and an extremely low rate of stroke (1.9%) and PPI (9.6%) was observed. The intended performance of the valve was attained in 96.1% of patients and it was maintained at 1-year follow-up. Clinical efficacy at 1 year was reached in 90.6% of patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The LIRA method represents an alternative option for prosthesis sizing in patients with type 1 and type 2 BAV undergoing TAVR with promising early and midterm outcomes.","['Barbara Bellini', 'Vittorio Romano', 'Greca Zanda', 'Gianmarco Iannopollo', 'Tommaso De Ferrari', 'Eva Bijlsma', 'Francesca Napoli', 'Ciro Vella', 'Domitilla Gentile', 'Giulia Ghizzoni', 'Luca Angelo Ferri', 'Filippo Russo', 'Marco Bruno Ancona', 'Francesco Ancona', 'Eustachio Agricola', 'Anna Palmisano', 'Antonio Esposito', 'Matteo Montorfano']",The Canadian journal of cardiology,2025-05-12,10.1016/j.cjca.2024.12.006,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2024.12.006,,Paid,Clinical Outcomes of Patients With Bicuspid Aortic Valve Undergoing a Targeted Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Approach The LIRA Method BELLINI 2025,Not available,"['Targeted Transcatheter Aortic', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Valve Replacement Approach', 'Bicuspid Aortic Valve', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Targeted Transcatheter', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'Aortic Valve', 'Replacement Approach', 'LIRA Method']",2025-05-12,Pending,[]
39343570,Association between the Mean Platelet Volume and Prosthesis-patient Mismatch after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.,"Objective The mean platelet volume (MPV), a marker of platelet activity, is significantly higher in patients with aortic stenosis (AS) than in those without AS. The association between the platelet function and prosthesis-patient mismatch (PPM) after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) remains unknown. Therefore, we investigated this association by measuring the MPV. Methods Of 237 patients who underwent TAVR, 148 with a median age of 84 years old were enrolled in this study. Blood tests and transthoracic echocardiography were performed at baseline and approximately six months after TAVR. PPM was defined as an aortic valve area index ≤0.85 cm2/m2 after TAVR. Variable changes from baseline to six-month follow-up were compared between patients with and without PPM. Results Forty-five patients (30%) developed PPM. The MPV was significantly higher in patients with PPM than in those without PPM. However, regarding the magnitude of change, the MPV was significantly less reduced in patients with PPM, and the percentage of patients with reduced MPV was lower in patients with PPM than in those without PPM. A logistic regression analysis revealed that a higher MPV and lack of MPV reduction at the six-month follow-up were independent predictors of PPM. Conclusion MPV values at the six-month follow-up were associated with PPM after TAVR in patients with AS. MPV values increase when PPM is present after TAVR and may be an indicator during the postoperative follow-up.","['Yuichi Morita', 'Hiroki Ikenaga', 'Atsushi Takeda', 'Takayuki Nakano', 'Tasuku Higashihara', 'Noriaki Watanabe', 'Yoshiharu Sada', 'Hiroto Utsunomiya', 'Shinya Takahashi', 'Yukihiro Fukuda', 'Yukiko Nakano']","Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",2025-04-15,10.2169/internalmedicine.4205-24,https://doi.org/10.2169/internalmedicine.4205-24,,Paid,Association between the Mean Platelet Volume and Prosthesis patient Mismatch after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement MORITA 2025,Not available,"['Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'PPM', 'Platelet Volume', 'MPV', 'Aortic Valve', 'Prosthesis-patient Mismatch', 'Valve Replacement', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'TAVR']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['aortic stenosis', 'mean platelet volume', 'prosthesis-patient mismatch', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"
38936601,Five-year outcomes of transcarotid transcatheter aortic valve replacement.,"BACKGROUND: Transcarotid transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TC-TAVR) has emerged as an alternative access route for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). However, scarce data exist on long-term outcomes following TC-TAVR. This study aimed to evaluate clinical outcomes at 5 years after TC-TAVR.
METHODS: A total of 110 consecutive patients who underwent TC-TAVR were included. Baseline, procedural, and follow-up data were collected prospectively in a dedicated database. The primary endpoint was the incidence of a composite outcome of all-cause mortality, stroke, and repeat hospitalization at 5-year follow-up. Echocardiography results, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, and quality of life (QoL) as assessed with the EuroQol visual analog scale (EQ-VAS) were examined over the 5-year follow-up.
RESULTS: The median patient age was 77 years (interquartile range [IQR], 72-82.2 years), 42.3% were women, and the median Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) risk score was 5.02% (IQR, 3.4%-7.5%). The incidence of the composite primary endpoint was 54.5%. Death from any cause occurred in 45.6% of patients (11.9 per 100 patient-years); stroke in 8.2% (1.9 per 100 patient-years); disabling stroke in 2.7% (0.7 per 100 patient-years); and rehospitalization in 27.2%. The improvements in valve hemodynamics, NYHA class, and EQ-VAS following the procedure persisted at 5-year follow-up (P < .001). The incidence of bioprosthetic valve failure was 0.9%.
CONCLUSIONS: About half of the moderate-to high-risk patients undergoing TC-TAVR survived with no major cardiovascular events at the 5-year follow-up. The yearly incidence of stroke events was low, and early improvements in valve hemodynamics, functional status, and QoL persisted at 5 years. These results suggest the long-term safety and efficacy of TC-TAVR and would support this approach as an alternative to surgery in non-transfemoral candidates.","['Juan Hernando Del Portillo', 'Dimitri Kalavrouziotis', 'Eric Dumont', 'Jean-Michel Paradis', 'Anthony Poulin', 'Frederic Beaupré', 'Marisa Avvedimento', 'Silvia Mas-Peiro', 'Pedro Cepas-Guillén', 'Siddhartha Mengi', 'Siamak Mohammadi', 'Josep Rodés-Cabau']",The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,2025-05-12,10.1016/j.jtcvs.2024.06.017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcvs.2024.06.017,,Paid,Five year outcomes of transcarotid transcatheter aortic valve replacement PORTILLO 2025,Not available,"['transcarotid transcatheter aortic', 'aortic valve replacement', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'transcatheter aortic', 'transcarotid transcatheter', 'valve replacement', 'aortic valve', 'replacement', 'aortic', 'transcatheter']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['aortic valve', 'long-term', 'transcarotid', 'transcatheter valve replacement']"
40353875,Evidence of bioprosthetic valve dysfunction during three-year follow-up following TAVR.,"OBJECTIVE: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has increased significantly in younger patients and patients at lower surgical risk. In this retrospective multicenter study, we aimed to assess for bioprosthetic valve dysfunction (BVD) during three-year follow-up (FU) and potential differences between self-expandable (SEV) and balloon-expandable valves (BEV) under real-world conditions.
METHODS: Endpoints were defined according to VARC-3 criteria, including VARC composite endpoints during three-year FU.
RESULTS: A total of 1233 patients with tricuspid aortic valve stenosis, who underwent TAVR with contemporary transcatheter heart valve (THV) devices from three different tertiary care centers were included. One-fifth of the study population showed BVD at three-year FU (BVD[-]: n = 957;77.6%; BVD[+]: n = 276;22.4%). Non-structural valve deterioration (NSVD) was the most represented category (8.5%) followed by structural valve deterioration (SVD, 5.3%). BVD was more common in association with BEV as compared with SEV (60.9% vs 39.1%; p < 0.001) owing to higher rates of SVD (13.5% vs 9.5%; p = 0.028) and NSVD (17.9% vs. 13.8%; p = 0.048). Subclinical leaflet thrombosis was only documented in BEV (1.7%, p < 0.001). At three years, all-cause mortality was higher in BVD+ patients (BVD[-] vs. BVD[+]: 13.2% vs. 22.5%; HR: 1.99; 95%-CI: 1.39-2.85; p < 0.001*) but did not differ between THV platform.
CONCLUSION: BVD after TAVR is common and associated with higher all-cause mortality. Despite a preponderance of BVD in association with balloon-expandable valves, mortality rates remain similar between THV platforms.

40348045,Impact of Annulus Size on Bioprosthetic Valve Failure after Self-Expanding Transcatheter Heart Valves Replacement.,"There is limited evidence on the prognosis and long-term valve durability after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in patients with small aortic annulus (SAA) and large aortic annulus (LAA). This analysis was sought to evaluate the impact of annular size differences on patients' and valve outcomes. A total of 1,211 patients undergoing TAVR using self-expandable transcatheter heart valve (SE-THV) were retrospectively analyzed. The cut-off for SAA was defined as annulus perimeter of < 72 mm. The primary endpoints were all-cause mortality and bioprosthetic valve failure (BVF) between the SAA and LAA groups. As a sub-analysis, the impact of post-procedural mean pressure gradient (mPG) ≥ 20mmHg and severe prosthesis-patient mismatch (PPM) on these outcomes were also evaluated. Of all patients, 60.1% (n=723) had SAA. At 7 years after TAVR, the SAA group had lower incidence of all-cause mortality (53.7% vs. 63.7%, log-rank p=0.05) and lower event rate of BVF than LAA (1.2% vs. 4.6%, p=0.01 for Gray's test). Multivariate Cox-regression and Fine-Gray competing risk regression analysis demonstrated the presence of SAA was related to better prognosis (Hazard ratio [HR]: 0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.67 to 0.98) and lower BVF (adjusted subdistribution HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.98). There were no impact of post-procedural mPG ≥ 20 mmHg or severe PPM on the difference of mortality and BVF. Further, these results were consistent in the patients with SAAs. In conclusion, SAA had better long-term patients' prognosis and valve durability after TAVR with SE-THV.","['Hirofumi Hioki', 'Masanori Yamamoto', 'Tetsuro Shimura', 'Shinichi Shirai', 'Kenichi Ishizu', 'Yohei Ohno', 'Fumiaki Yashima', 'Toru Naganuma', 'Yusuke Watanabe', 'Futoshi Yamanaka', 'Gaku Nakazawa', 'Masahiko Noguchi', 'Masaki Izumo', 'Masahiko Asami', 'Hidetaka Nishina', 'Yasushi Fuku', 'Toshiaki Otsuka', 'Kentaro Hayashida']",The American journal of cardiology,2025-05-08,10.1016/j.amjcard.2025.05.008,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjcard.2025.05.008,,Paid,Impact of Annulus Size on Bioprosthetic Valve Failure after Self Expanding Transcatheter Heart Valves Replacement HIOKI 2025,Not available,"['Heart Valves Replacement', 'Self-Expanding Transcatheter Heart', 'aortic valve replacement', 'Bioprosthetic Valve Failure', 'Transcatheter Heart Valves', 'Transcatheter Heart', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'Valve', 'SAA', 'Valves Replacement']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Bioprosthetic valve failure', 'Self-expandable transcatheter heart valve', 'Small aortic annulus', 'Transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"
40347211,Cerebral embolic protection in transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI): a pooled analysis of 4091 patients.,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is increasingly used for severe aortic stenosis, but debris embolization during the procedure can lead to strokes, impacting survival and quality of life. The role of cerebral embolic protection devices (CEPDs) in mitigating stroke risk remains debated. We aim to evaluate the impact of CEPDs on the risk of stroke and neurocognitive outcomes after TAVI.
METHODS: Six databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane, Embase, and Ovid) were searched until 20 January 2023. Original randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were only included and critically appraised using the Cochrane risk of bias (ROB) tool.
RESULTS: Seven RCTs (4091 patients) were analyzed. CEPDs significantly reduced the risk of disabling stroke within 2-5 days post-TAVI (relative risk = 0.455, 95% CI: [0.214, 0.967]; p = 0.041). However, there was no significant difference in disabling stroke risk between the two groups at the 30-day follow-up (relative risk = 1.295, 95% CI: [0.373, 4.493]; p = 0.684). No significant differences were observed in non-disabling or overall stroke rates at 2-5 days, 30 days, or 90 days. Additionally, CEPDs did not significantly affect risks of life-threatening bleeding, major vascular complications, mortality, or acute kidney injury.
CONCLUSION: CEPDs are effective in reducing disabling stroke risk in the immediate post-TAVI period (2-5 days) but did not significantly affect the rates of non-disabling stroke, overall stroke, or disabling stroke after 30 days when compared to non-CEPD use. These findings suggest that CEPDs may offer short-term neuroprotection.","['Mahmoud Balata', 'Mohamed Ibrahim Gbreel', 'Mohamed Hamouda Elkasaby', 'Ahmed Samy Badran', 'Marwa Hassan', 'Ralf Westenfeld', 'Roman Pfister', 'Sebastian Zimmer', 'Marc Ulrich Becher', 'Georg Nickenig', 'Atsushi Sugiura']",Cardiovascular intervention and therapeutics,2025-05-10,10.1007/s12928-025-01128-3,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12928-025-01128-3,PMC5234463,Free,Cerebral embolic protection in transcatheter aortic valve implantation TAVI a pooled analysis of 4091 patients BALATA 2025,pdfs\Cerebral embolic protection in transcatheter aortic valve implantation TAVI a pooled analysis of 4091 patients BALATA 2025.pdf,"['transcatheter aortic valve', 'Library window', 'aortic valve implantation', 'Library', 'references', 'EndNote', 'transcatheter aortic', 'reviewers', 'EndNote library', 'title']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Cerebral embolic protection', 'Meta-analysis', 'Neurological complications', 'Systematic review', 'Transcatheter valve implantation']"

The patient had hepatic cirrhosis and was not a candidate for redo surgical valve replacement. A computed tomography transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) demonstrated severe aorto-ostial left main calcific disease, with dense calcification from the annulus to the inferior border of the left main ostium, which was thought to represent a retained native leaflet, with high risk of coronary obstruction.
CASE SUMMARY: Using cerebral protection, rotational atherectomy was undertaken through the aorto-ostial calcification and retained leaflet, followed by left main stem percutaneous coronary intervention. A staged TAVI with a 23-mm Sapien S3 and a chimney stent for coronary protection was successful.
DISCUSSION: Although concomitant left main stem rotational atherectomy and TAVI have been described, no reports of rotablation to facilitate leaflet modification have been identified.
TAKE-HOME MESSAGES: Rotational atherectomy helped to modify the retained aortic valve leaflet and safely facilitate TAVI in a nonsurgical candidate.","['Andrew R Chapman', 'Lance Ng', 'Shaw Hua Kueh', 'Peter Barr', 'Jonathon White', 'Mark Webster']",JACC.

40344455,Restoration of a Stuck Leaflet.,"Severe aortic regurgitation (AR) for a leaflet malfunction after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is a dreadful complication that can lead even to cardiogenic shock. New valve's design has reduced the rate of paravalvular regurgitation, however central regurgitation is still a challenging complication. An 88-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis underwent TAVI with an Edwards Sapien III valve. After the procedure, angiography revealed third-degree angiographic central AR, causing hemodynamic instability. The team suspected a stuck leaflet and corrected it with catheter manipulation. The patient's condition stabilized, and follow-up echocardiography showed proper valve position and function. Severe AR following TAVI, while rare, can result in critical clinical deterioration. Recent evidence suggest that even mild grade of AR post-TAVI can affect long-term outcomes. This case has the aim to promote a prompt diagnosis and intervention on a stuck leaflet to reduce patient morbidity, hospitalization time, and resource utilization. This case illustrates the warning scenario of a severe central AR for a stuck leaflet after TAVI. Prompt recognition and management of this complication are crucial to improving clinical outcomes.","['Elisa Tomarelli', 'Gianluca Di Pietro', 'Gennaro Sardella', 'Massimo Mancone']",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,2025-05-08,10.1002/ccd.31550,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.31550,,Paid,Restoration of a Stuck Leaflet TOMARELLI 2025,Not available,"['Stuck Leaflet', 'Edwards Sapien III', 'Sapien III valve', 'Stuck', 'Leaflet', 'TAVI', 'valve', 'Edwards Sapien', 'Sapien III', 'Severe']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['aortic regurgitation', 'aortic stenosis, transcatheter aortic valve implantation', 'post‐TAVI complications', 'stuck leaflet']"
40343748,Bicuspid aortic valve disease: advancements and challenges of transcatheter aortic valve implantation.,"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has revolutionized the treatment of patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS). Initially developed for patients with tricuspid aortic valve (TAV) anatomy, the procedural success and expanding indications of TAVI have spurred interest in its application to more complex aortic valve anatomies, such as the bicuspid aortic valve (BAV). The growing interest in this specific sub-set of patients with AS is driven by the recent extension of TAVI indications to younger individuals, who exhibit a notably higher incidence of bicuspid anatomy compared with older populations. Bicuspid aortic valves present distinct anatomical and pathological complexities that pose significant challenges to the conventional TAVI approach. These include asymmetric calcification, aortic root dilation (also known as BAV aortopathy), and variations in cusp fusion patterns, which can affect valve deployment, transcatheter heart valve sealing, and long-term durability. Despite these challenges, advancements in imaging techniques, valve design, and procedural strategies have led to increased adoption of TAVI in BAV patients. However, surgical aortic valve replacement still retains a more prominent role in this group compared with patients with TAVs. This preference is partly due to the exclusion of BAV patients from almost all previous randomized controlled trials, which limits the available evidence supporting the use of TAVI in this unique cohort. This state-of-the-art review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current landscape of TAVI in BAV patients, including an analysis of anatomical considerations and procedural pitfalls, as well as outcomes' improvements with new device iterations. It will also explore clinical data, tackling the risks, benefits, and the evolving role of TAVI in this unique patient cohort.","['Marco Barbanti', 'Giuliano Costa', 'Stephan Windecker', 'Francesco Maisano', 'Giulia Laterra', 'Jonathon Leipsic', 'Philipp Blanke', 'Vinayak N Bapat', 'Martin B Leon', 'John G Webb']",European heart journal,2025-05-09,10.1093/eurheartj/ehaf307,https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehaf307,,Paid,Bicuspid aortic valve disease advancements and challenges of transcatheter aortic valve implantation BARBANTI 2025,Not available,"['aortic valve implantation', 'aortic valve', 'TAVI', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'aortic', 'aortic valve disease', 'Bicuspid aortic valve', 'valve', 'BAV patients', 'Bicuspid aortic']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Aortopathy', 'Bicuspid aortic valve', 'Bioprosthesis', 'Congenital heart disease', 'Sizing', 'TAVI', 'Transcatheter aortic valve implantation']"

METHODS AND RESULTS: This retrospective two-center study included 173 patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing transfemoral TAVI with Navitor™ THV. Patients with prior pacemaker implantation and valve-in-valve procedures were excluded. Mean age was 81.5 ± 5.0 years, and 54 patients (31 %) required PPI; they were more often male (57 % vs. 37 %, p = 0.01), had higher left ventricular ejection fraction (55.3 ± 9.0 vs. 52.4 ± 9.2, p = 0.049), and higher rates of COPD (30 % vs. 16 %, p = 0.017) and pre-existing right bundle branch block (RBBB; 17 % vs. 0.8 %, p < 0.001). Procedural factors associated with PPI included greater annulus-to-THV oversizing (13.6 % ± 3.4 vs. 12.5 % ± 3.1, p = 0.041), implantation depth > 4 mm (75.9 % vs. 52.1 %, p = 0.002), and 29 mm valve size use (46.3 % vs. 26.9 %, p = 0.010). At multivariable analysis, COPD (OR 2.4, p = 0.049), pre-existing RBBB (OR 34.4, p = 0.001), annulus-to-THV oversizing (OR 1.2, p = 0.002), and implantation depth > 4 mm (OR 3.2, p = 0.007) were independent predictors of PPI. ROC analysis (AUC 0.58) identified an optimal cut-off of 15 % annulus-to-THV oversizing for predicting PPI.

40336935,When the heart becomes suicidal: a case report of severe left ventricular outflow tract obstruction following transcatheter aortic valve implantation.,"BACKGROUND: Replacement of the aortic valve is a Class I recommendation for treatment of patients suffering from severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis. However, aortic valve replacement can occasionally lead to complications, including development of acute left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction. This rare but severe complication is referred to as the so-called 'suicide left ventricle' phenomenon.
CASE SUMMARY: This case report presents an 88-year-old woman who developed severe LVOT obstruction following a successful transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), complicated by septal anterior motion of the mitral valve resulting in severe mitral regurgitation. Despite initial intensive care management, her symptoms persisted, necessitating the application of transcoronary ablation of septal hypertrophy as a bail-out procedure. Transcoronary ablation of septal hypertrophy, typically used in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, successfully reduced the LVOT gradient and relieved symptoms.
DISCUSSION: This case emphasizes the importance of pre-operative identification of LVOT obstruction risk factors, awareness for this complication and a well-experience multidisciplinary team for the management of TAVI-associated complications.","['Carl Schulz', 'Fabian J Brunner', 'Simon Pecha', 'Nils Sörensen', 'Niklas Schofer']",European heart journal.

40334499,[Accessibility to TAVI in a center without cardiac surgery : a Corsican example].,"INTRODUCTION: Aortic stenosis is the most common valvular disease in France. Its prevalence increases with age, affecting more than 10 % of people over 70 years old. Once symptomatic, the prognosis is grim, with a mortality rate close to 50 % within 2 years. European guidelines for the management of severe aortic stenosis recommend rapid treatment upon the onset of symptoms. However, aortic stenosis remains largely underdiagnosed and undertreated, especially with limited and increasingly complex access to care due to geography. The primary objective of this work is to analyze the management of all patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis referred to the Bastia Hospital from January 2019 to December 2022. The secondary objective is to study the factors that delay care and assess the consequences for these patients' outcomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from 151 patients diagnosed with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2022, at the Bastia Hospital were retrospectively collected.
RESULTS: Our population consisted of 69 % men, with an average age of 80 years. The operative risk was low, with an average Euroscore of 5 (Euroscore 0-45). The vast majority of patients were symptomatic, with exertional dyspnea NYHA >2 (76 %). The average LVEF was 55 %, meaning most patients had preserved left ventricular ejection fraction. One significant piece of data we collected was the waiting time before the procedure. Among the included patients (102), the time between diagnosis and TAVI implantation was an average of 162 days (over 5 months). The time between coronary angiography and TAVI implantation was around 109 days, compared to the national average of 70 days. Among the included patients, 13 % died while on the waiting list, and 7 % refused the proposed treatment. The study of preoperative workup delays did not identify any particular test as the main cause, but we can conclude that the overall process contributes to these results.
CONCLUSION: This study reveals that a quarter of patients with severe aortic stenosis in this population currently cannot benefit from percutaneous valve replacement. On-site management, without the need for cardiac surgery, could be considered to reduce waiting times and mortality, as is done elsewhere in Europe.","['F Ferrandi', 'F Collart', 'A Cribier', 'H Eltchaninoff', 'P Luporsi']",Annales de cardiologie et d'angeiologie,2025-05-06,10.1016/j.ancard.2025.101898,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ancard.2025.101898,,Paid,[Accessibility to TAVI in a center without cardiac surgery a Corsican example] FERRANDI 2025,Not available,"['severe aortic stenosis', 'Aortic stenosis', 'symptomatic severe aortic', 'severe aortic', 'Aortic', 'stenosis', 'patients', 'Bastia Hospital', 'Accessibility to TAVI', 'Accessibility']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Centres dépourvus de chirurgie cardiaque', 'Death on waiting list', 'Discontinuité géographique', 'Décès sur liste d’attente', 'Geographic discontinuity', 'Hospitals without cardiac surgery on site', 'TAVI']"
40329985,Assessment of the Impact of Dexmedetomidine on Myocardial Injury in TAVI Patients: A Retrospective Cohort Study Utilizing PSM-DID.,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) is a minimally invasive procedure for treating severe aortic valve diseases but can lead to perioperative myocardial damage (PMD). Dexmedetomidine (DEX), an α2-adrenergic receptor agonist, has shown potential to reduce myocardial injury in other cardiac procedures. This effect is attributed to its anti-inflammatory properties, which help reduce the inflammatory response associated with myocardial damage, and its antioxidant properties, which combat oxidative stress that contributes to cell injury. But its effectiveness during TAVI remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of DEX on myocardial injury in patients undergoing TAVI under general anesthesia.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of 159 patients (after exclusions) who underwent TAVI from January 2022 to August 2024. Patients were divided into DEX and control groups. Primary outcomes were peak levels of cardiac troponin I and CK-MB within 48 hours postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included IL-6, PCT, and NT-proBNP levels. Propensity score matching (PSM) and Differences-in-Differences (DID) method were used for analysis.
RESULTS: After PSM, the DEX group exhibited significantly lower peak values of troponin I (P < 0.001) and CK-MB (P < 0.001) compared to the control group, indicating reduced myocardial injury. No significant differences were observed in IL-6, PCT, and NT-proBNP levels between the groups. The DID analysis suggested a negative correlation between DEX use and major adverse postoperative events, highlighting DEX as a potential protective factor.
CONCLUSION: Dexmedetomidine administration during TAVI was associated with reduced levels of myocardial injury markers, indicating a potential cardioprotective role. By reducing myocardial injury, DEX may contribute to improved perioperative outcomes, including a decreased risk of major adverse postoperative events. These results highlight the potential clinical utility of DEX in the perioperative management of TAVI patients, suggesting that its inclusion in anesthetic protocols could enhance patient care and recovery.","['Yang Song', 'Jin Zhang', 'Huiping Xu', 'Chaoqun Gui', 'Hao Cheng', 'Yongquan Chen', 'Shaolin Wang']",Therapeutics and clinical risk management,2025-05-12,10.2147/TCRM.S507439,https://doi.org/10.2147/TCRM.S507439,PMC12053920,Free,Assessment of the Impact of Dexmedetomidine on Myocardial Injury in TAVI Patients A Retrospective Cohort Study Utilizing PSM DID SONG 2025,pdfs\Assessment of the Impact of Dexmedetomidine on Myocardial Injury in TAVI Patients A Retrospective Cohort Study Utilizing PSM DID SONG 2025.p.pdf,"['Myocardial Injury', 'DEX', 'Myocardial', 'TAVI', 'TAVI Patients', 'Injury', 'Patients', 'DEX group', 'patients undergoing TAVI', 'Retrospective Cohort Study']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['dexmedetomidine', 'inflammation', 'myocardial ischemia', 'propensity score', 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement']"
40326653,Transferring Structured Medical Data from Hospital to Rehabilitation Facilities Using HL7 FHIR and openEHR.,"Inter-institutional and inter-professional communication is based on the prompt and complete transmission of relevant health data, whereas conventional paper-based data transmission is often delayed and incomplete. One main objective of the CAEHR project is to optimize inter-sectoral information provision and to establish structured health data transfer from hospitals to rehabilitation facilities for TAVI patients. After a thorough requirement analysis conducted through structured interviews with medical experts from different fields, web portal instances were deployed at two university medical centres, providing data access to rehabilitation facilities involved in the patient care. Data transfer of medical and nursing data is extracted from the primary hospital information system and transformed to FHIR and openEHR format, respectively, via data mapping. After informed consent has been obtained, data is sent to the web portal. This portal is implemented on a Kubernetes system and hosted at university medical centres, allowing restricted external access. Questionnaires and assessment outcomes are sent back as follow-ups from rehabilitation facilities. The ongoing clinical study has included 142 patients so far.

40325986,Prognostic implications and predictive factors of subclinical leaflet thrombosis following valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve implantation.,"BACKGROUND: Subclinical leaflet thrombosis, as indicated by hypoattenuated leaflet thickening (HALT) on computed tomography (CT) imaging, remains a major concern owing to its potential impact on valve function and patient outcomes.
AIMS: We aimed to evaluate the association between HALT and clinical outcomes in patients undergoing valve-in-valve (ViV) transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) with balloon-expandable valves and to identify predictors of leaflet thrombosis.
METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent ViV TAVI with balloon-expandable valves at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center were retrospectively analysed. We analysed both pre- and postprocedural CT scans to identify predictors of HALT at 1 month after ViV TAVI and the association of HALT with clinical outcomes. The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause mortality, hospitalisation for heart failure (HF), or stroke at 3 years.
RESULTS: Among the 117 patients analysed, HALT was detected in 37 (31.6%). In the multivariable analysis, anticoagulation therapy (odds ratio [OR] 0.28, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.08-0.92; p=0.037) and greater transcatheter heart valve (THV) expansion at the minimum area level (OR 0.95, 95% CI: 0.91-0.99; p=0.026) were significant predictors of reduced HALT following ViV TAVI. While there was no significant difference in all-cause mortality between patients with and without HALT (OR 1.13, 95% CI: 0.42-3.02; p=0.8), those with HALT had a significantly higher incidence of the composite primary outcome (OR 2.31, 95% CI: 1.04-5.15; p=0.04).

40325985,Thrombus characterisation and evolution of hypoattenuating leaflet thickening after transcatheter aortic valve implantation.,"BACKGROUND: Quantifying hypoattenuating leaflet thickening (HALT) on computed tomography angiography (CTA) may provide insights into its clinical implications and guide decisions on oral anticoagulation therapy following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).
AIMS: We sought to assess the association between quantitative CTA features of HALT and its evolution over time in a real-world cohort after TAVI.
METHODS: Among 612 patients who underwent CTA 30 days post-TAVI with balloon-expandable bioprostheses, HALT was detected in 118 (19%). We prospectively followed 99 patients who had undergone a second CTA at 1 year to assess HALT progression. Thrombus volume and mean attenuation were quantified using semiautomated software, and various parameters of bioprosthetic deformation were analysed.
RESULTS: Complete resolution of HALT was observed in 43 patients. Multivariate logistic regression showed that lower thrombus attenuation was an independent predictor of HALT resolution (odds ratio [OR] 0.45; p=0.030), along with the eccentricity index (OR 0.42; p=0.003), deformation index (OR 0.53; p=0.005), and implant canting (OR 1.88; p=0.026). In the 56 patients without complete HALT resolution, thrombus evolution was visually categorised as regression (48%), stability (29%), or progression (23%). In a quantitative assessment, regression was associated with a significant decrease in thrombus volume (291 mmÂ³ to 130 mmÂ³; p=0.007), while progression showed an increase (187 mmÂ³ to 667 mmÂ³; p=0.005). The change in thrombus volume between 30 days and 1 year correlated with the magnitude of changes in mean transvalvular gradients over the same period (r=0.462; p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative thrombus characterisation on CTA is predictive of HALT resolution and correlates with the haemodynamic performance of transcatheter aortic valves.","['Kajetan Grodecki', 'Damini Dey', 'Jolien Geers', 'Jacek Kwiecinski', 'Guadalupe Flores Tomasino', 'Vivek Patel', 'Caroline Park', 'Emily Xing', 'Dhairya Patel', 'Kazuki Suruga', 'Aakriti Gupta', 'Mamoo Nakamura', 'Mitch Gheorghiu', 'Tarun Chakravarty', 'Daniel Berman', 'Piotr Slomka', 'Hasan Jilaihawi', 'Raj R Makkar']",EuroIntervention : journal of EuroPCR in collaboration with the Working Group on Interventional Cardiology of the European Society of Cardiology,2025-05-05,10.4244/EIJ-D-24-01043,https://doi.org/10.4244/EIJ-D-24-01043,PMC12038363,Paid,Thrombus characterisation and evolution of hypoattenuating leaflet thickening after transcatheter aortic valve implantation GRODECKI 2025,Not downloaded,"['aortic valve implantation', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'hypoattenuating leaflet thickening', 'Quantifying hypoattenuating leaflet', 'HALT', 'transcatheter aortic', 'valve implantation', 'aortic valve', 'hypoattenuating leaflet', 'leaflet thickening']",2025-05-12,Pending,[]

A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted. PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Web of Science databases were searched for relevant articles up to April 10th, 2024. Studies that reported comparisons of clinical outcomes between PCI before/concomitant with TAVI (PCI-TAVI) vs. TAVI alone, or comparisons between PCI before/concomitant with TAVI vs. PCI after TAVI (TAVI-PCI) were selected. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality in the short-term, mid-term and long-term follow-up. A total of 23 studies pooling 15812 patients were included. Compared to TAVI alone, PCI-TAVI showed no significant difference in all-cause mortality at short- and mid-term (RRshort-term = 1.10 95%CI 0.88-1.38; RRmid-term = 1.12 95%CI 0.97-1.30), but an increase during long-term follow-up (RRlong-term = 1.20 95%CI 1.06-1.36). Compared with PCI-TAVI, TAVI-PCI is associated with lower rate of all-cause mortality at both short- and long-term follow-ups. PCI before or concomitant with TAVI may not offer clinical benefits and could potentially lead to worse outcomes in the long term. Conversely, PCI after TAVI is associated with improved clinical outcomes in both the short and long term.","['Dayang Wang', 'Sijia Lai', 'Zichen Wang', 'Changbo Xuan', 'Xiaoxia Ren', 'Wenhua Peng', 'Guozhong Pan']",PloS one,2025-05-12,10.1371/journal.pone.0321395,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0321395,PMC12043176,Free,Impact of PCI strategies on outcomes of patients undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation with concomitant coronary artery disease A systematic review and meta analysis WANG 2025,pdfs\Impact of PCI strategies on outcomes of patients undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation with concomitant coronary artery disease.pdf,"['PCI', 'Aortic Valve Implantation', 'TAVI', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'undergoing Transcatheter Aortic', 'Aortic Valve', 'Valve Implantation', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'coronary artery disease', 'patients undergoing Transcatheter']",2025-05-12,Pending,[]

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of a comprehensive, minimalistic approach to TAVI utilizing all available devices in all-comers, real-world population.
METHODS: This is a prospective, single-center, single-arm clinical study. The primary endpoint of the study was a composite of 30-day all-cause mortality, disabling stroke, major bleedings, major vascular complications, stage 3 acute kidney injury (AKI), and permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI). Outcomes were compared to those of an historical cohort of patients undergoing TAVI following a standard approach, by selecting pairs of patients selected through a 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM). A cost analysis of TAVI hospitalization was performed considering costs related to procedural complications and post-procedural length of stay (LoS).
RESULTS: Between January 2020 and December 2023, a total of 997 patients underwent TAVI following an optimized, minimalistic pathway. Device success was reported in 88.2% patients, with low procedural complications. The primary endpoint occurred in 21.1% of patients. After PSM, TAVI patients following the minimalistic pathway had higher device success (91.4% vs 84.2%, p = 0.004), and lower major vascular complications (4.5% vs. 10.3%, p = 0.004) compared to those following the standard approach. Median LoS was shorter (1.0 day vs. 2.0 days, p < 0.001) and the rate of next-day discharge was higher (46.7% vs. 19.0%, p < 0.001) in patients following the minimalistic pathway, with lower hospitalization costs (median € 2200 vs. 3150; p < 0.001). At 30-day, the primary endpoint was significantly lower in patients following the minimalistic pathway (17.2% vs 23.9%, p = 0.034).
CONCLUSIONS: The minimalistic TAVI care pathway was associated with favorable outcomes in an unselected, real-world population.

40301223,Long-term outcome of bail-out ViV-TAVI at index procedure.,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare in-hospital and long-term outcomes of patients with bail-out valve-in-valve TAVI due to a primarily failed transcatheter aortic valves procedure (bViV-TAVI) versus a successful transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).
METHODS: We recorded bViV-TAVI procedures at our center from February 2011 to March 2022. Primary endpoint was long-term mortality. In-hospital mortality, stroke, acute kidney failure, need for new permanent pacemaker, and duration of intervention were secondary endpoints.
RESULTS: 4555 patients undergoing TAVI were retrospectively included. 231 matched (77:154) patients were analyzed. BViV-TAVI was a rare event (1.9%). In 76.7% of the cases transcatheter valve embolization and migration were the reasons for implanting a second valve in the same procedure. Significant PVL accounted for bViV-TAVI in 23.4% of the patients. The duration of the intervention was significantly longer for the bViV-TAVI group (p < 0.001). BViV-TAVI patients showed higher rates of a new permanent pacemaker implantation (p = 0.013) and the postprocedural mean pressure was significantly higher (p = 0.03). Concerning the other secondary endpoints there was a trend for a higher event rate in bVIV-TAVI patients which did not reach significant difference. After an average follow-up period of 4.9 ± 3.0 years, mortality was significantly higher in the bViV-TAVI group (54.5% vs. 39.0%, p = 0.025).
CONCLUSION: The implantation of a second valve during the same procedure as bail-out is a feasible alternative treatment option in patients with failed transcatheter aortic valve procedures.

40298371,AI-based prediction of left bundle branch block risk post-TAVI using pre-implantation clinical parameters.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) has revolutionized the treatment of severe aortic stenosis. Although its clinical efficacy is well established, the development of new-onset left bundle branch block (LBBB) following TAVI remains a frequent and concerning complication. This study aims to develop pre-implantation predictive models for new-onset LBBB after TAVI using both conventional machine learning (ML) algorithms and Large Language Models (LLMs).
METHODS: Of the 1113 patients who underwent TAVI over a 15-year period, 469 were included after excluding those with preexisting LBBB, pacing rhythm, or missing relevant data. Pre-procedural clinical parameters - such as valve type, valve size, patient demographics, and comorbidities - were analyzed. The dataset was split into training and testing sets. Several ML algorithms were employed, and performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, and F1 score. Additionally, LLMs (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) were assessed using Few-Shot and Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting.
RESULTS: New-onset persistent LBBB occurred in 15.29% of patients. Among ML models, XGBoost performed best. GPT-4 with CoT prompting demonstrated superior predictive performance compared to both conventional ML and GPT-3.5.
CONCLUSIONS: The current study establishes a predictive model leveraging pre-implantation parameters to anticipate the occurrence of new-onset left bundle branch block (LBBB) post-Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI).
Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) is a less invasive procedure used to treat patients with severe narrowing of the aortic valve. While it has significantly improved patient outcomes, some individuals develop a new heart rhythm problem called left bundle branch block (LBBB) after the procedure. LBBB can affect the heart’s electrical system and, in some cases, lead to complications such as the need for a permanent pacemaker.This study aimed to predict which patients are most likely to develop LBBB before the TAVR procedure by using artificial intelligence (AI) models. We analyzed data from 469 patients and tested different machine learning techniques, including traditional AI models and large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4. Our results showed that XGBoost, a machine learning algorithm, was the most accurate in predicting LBBB risk, while GPT-4 performed well when prompted using a specific reasoning approach (Chain of Thought method).These findings suggest that AI models can help identify high-risk patients before the procedure, allowing doctors to make better treatment decisions. However, further studies with larger patient groups are needed to confirm the accuracy of these predictions and improve personalized care for TAVR patients.","['Cheilas Vasileios', 'Filandrianos Giorgos', 'Martinos Antonios', 'Kostopoulou Anna']",Future cardiology,2025-04-29,10.1080/14796678.2025.2498866,https://doi.org/10.1080/14796678.2025.2498866,,Paid,AI based prediction of left bundle branch block risk post TAVI using pre implantation clinical parameters VASILEIOS 2025,Not available,"['Aortic Valve Implantation', 'left bundle branch', 'LBBB', 'Aortic Valve', 'bundle branch block', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'TAVI', 'bundle branch', 'Valve', 'Valve Implantation']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['LLMs', 'Transcatheter aortic valve replacement', 'aortic stenosis', 'artificial intelligence', 'individualized risk assessment', 'left bundle branch block', 'pre implantation predictors']"
40297162,"Current hotspot and study trend of transcatheter aortic valve replacement, a bibliometric analysis from 2009 to 2023.","INTRODUCTION: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), alternatively termed transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), represents a seminal advancement in cardiovascular interventions by obviating the necessity for open-heart surgery traditionally associated with surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). This technique entails percutaneous delivery of a bioprosthetic valve. Despite the surfeit of literature on TAVR over the past fifteen years, a bibliometric analysis is conspicuously absent.
METHOD: A query executed on the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) on September 1, 2022, returned 8,359 articles and reviews pertinent to TAVR. Data interpretation leveraged Microsoft Excel, CiteSpace, and VOSviewer to illustrate trends and delineate focal points within the corpus of TAVR research.
RESULT: The analysis incorporated 8,359 articles and reviews on TAVR from January 1, 2009, to August 1, 2023. Publication volume expanded from 35 in 2009 to a pinnacle in 2020, reflecting a near thirty folds increase, with citations escalating from 56 in 2009 to 27,354 in 2021.

40295134,"Evaluation of the efficacy of angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor in patients with aortic stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation: protocol for a randomised, open-label, controlled study.","INTRODUCTION: There are a substantial number of patients developing heart failure after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) for severe aortic stenosis (AS), even though AS has been successfully treated. The purpose of this randomised controlled trial was to determine whether the addition of an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), sacubitril/valsartan, is superior to conventional medications in lowering N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels in patients undergoing TAVI for AS.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study design is a prospective, single-centre, open-label, randomised, parallel-group, two-arm study, in which participants will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either conventional medications plus ARNI or conventional medications only. In the ARNI group, if a patient was on an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker before TAVI, it will be switched to ARNI 100 mg/day (50 mg two times per day) on the first postoperative day. If not, candesartan 4 mg/day will be started 1-2 days before TAVI, and switched to ARNI 100 mg/day on the first postoperative day. As the patient has tolerability to ARNI, dosage will be increased stepwise to 400 mg/day 2-4 weeks apart. ARNI will be continued until at least 6-month follow-up. In the control group, the patient will receive conventional medications. The primary endpoint is the serum NT-proBNP value at 6-month follow-up after TAVI. Each group includes 42 patients (84 total patients).

40293726,Transcatheter aortic valve implantation versus surgery in low-risk patients: in-hospital and mid-term outcomes.,"OBJECTIVES: aim of our study is to compare post procedural outcomes and mid-term mortality of low-risk patients treated by transfemoral TAVI or surgical AVR for severe aortic stenosis.
METHODS: Data of consecutive patients undergoing AVR or TAVI from 09/2017 to 12/2021 were prospectively collected and retrospectively reviewed. Eligible patients were aged between 75 and 85 years with low-surgical risk and isolated severe aortic stenosis. Exclusion criteria were prior heart surgery, valve-in-valve procedure, and the need for concomitant procedures. The primary end-point was mid-term all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: 351 patients were enrolled. 243 underwent TAVI and 108 underwent AVR. Compared to AVR, TAVI patients were older (82 [78-83 ] vs 78 [77-80], p < 0.001), with higher incidence of advanced CKD (33.3% vs 15.7%, p < 0,001) and poor mobility (15.6% vs 5.6%, p = 0.008) and a higher Euroscore II (2.2 [1.72-2.98] vs 1.9 [1.31-2.46 ], p = 0.002). AVR patients had a higher incidence of post-procedural AKI (29.6% vs 4.5%, p < 0.001), while TAVI patients had a higher incidence of LBBB (23.9% vs 1.8%, p < 0.001) and at least mild to moderate PVL (4.5% vs 0%, p = 0.021). Mid- term mortality was higher among TAVI patients (HR 0.38 [95% CI 0.23-0.88], p = 0.020). In the matched cohort TAVI had a higher incidence of LBBB (11.5% vs 1.3%, p = 0.018) and permanent PM implantation (12.8% vs 5.1%, p = 0.041), while AVR patients had a higher incidence of post-procedural AKI (33.3% vs 5.1%, p < 0.001).

We systematically searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Springer, Cochrane, and Clinicaltrials.gov. for articles up to 25 March 2024 (PROSPERO ID CRD42024526311). A total of 204,078 patients from ten studies were included. Paravalvular regurgitation (RR 1.56 95 %CI: 1.32-1.84, p < 0.00001, I2 = 0 %) and aortic dissection (RR 3.55 95 %CI: 1.79-7.06, p = 0.0003, I2 = 40 %) were more common in AAD group. However, there were no differences in peri-procedural (RR 1.09, 95 %CI: 0.83-1.42, p = 0.53, I2 = 0 %) and 1-year (RR 0.79, 95 %CI: 0.51-1.23, p = 0.30, I2 = 0 %) mortality. Three-years (RR 0.88, 95 %CI: 0.54-1.44, p = 0.62) and five-years (RR 0.85, 95 %CI: 0.45-1.6, p = 0.61) follow-up showed comparable mortality between both groups. The other complications and the need for second valve implantation (RR 1.24, 95 %CI: 0.70-20.20, p = 0.48, I2 = 65 %) were similar between both groups. Despite the higher incidence of aortic dissection and paravalvular regurgitation in AAD than in non-AAD patients, these complications were not associated with worse short-term or long-term mortality. Therefore, TAVI remains a safe and effective option for AAD patients.","['Pandit Bagus Tri Saputra', 'Wynne Widiarti', 'Ali Mustofa', 'Cornelia Ghea Savitri', 'Johanes Nugroho Eko Putranto', 'Faisal Yusuf Ashari', 'Chaq El Chaq Zamzam Multazam', 'Firas Farisi Alkaff', ""Mario D'Oria""]",International journal of cardiology.

CASE SUMMARY: An 86-year-old female with severe aortic and mitral regurgitation was admitted due to acute pulmonary oedema, rapidly deteriorating in cardiogenic shock refractory to medical treatment. Haemodynamic stabilization was achieved only after implantation of an Impella CP, through a trans-femoral approach. Considering the prohibitive surgical risk, the mitral valve regurgitation was treated with a transcatheter edge-to-edge repair procedure, which allowed to successfully wean the patient from Impella. Subsequently, a transcatheter aortic valve implantation was performed. The patient's clinical status improved to such a level that a rehabilitation program was successfully implemented.
DISCUSSION: Our report shows that an entirely percutaneous approach, to manage a combined severe aortic and mitral regurgitation, complicated by cardiogenic shock, is feasible and effective.","['Francesco Lo Iudice', 'Amelia Ravera', 'Alfonso Campanile', 'Stefano Romei', 'Francesco Vigorito']",European heart journal.

40289877,Flow Reserve Does Not Predict Long-Term Outcomes After Transaortic Valve Implantation in Patients With Preserved Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction.,"PURPOSE: We aimed to assess if flow reserve (FR) in low-dose dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) could predict major cardiovascular events (MACE) 1 year after TAVI in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). We also explored the relationship between FR and NYHA class, 6-min walk test, left ventricular function, and quality of life (SF-36).
METHODS: The DSE protocol (n = 72) was performed up to 20 μg/kg/min preoperatively, and FR was defined as ≥ 20% increase in stroke volume (SV). Echocardiography, walking test, and SF-36 were repeated at 12 months follow-up.
RESULTS: Average age was 80 ± 5 years. Preoperative peak aortic valve velocity was 4.7 ± 0.6 m/s and LVEF was 65% ± 9%. SV increased from 81 ± 19 to 92 ± 20 mL during the DSE. Twenty-five patients (36%) had FR. The prevalence of MACE was 13% at follow-up. Patients with or without FR had no significant differences in MACE (p = 1.000), NYHA class (p = 0.375), walking distance (p = 0.262), left ventricular function, or quality of life.
CONCLUSION: FR in DSE could not predict long-term outcomes after TAVI, and offered no additional prognostic value for this patient group.","['Marte Sævik', 'Jan O Beitnes', 'Lars Aaberge', 'Per S Halvorsen']",Journal of clinical ultrasound : JCU,2025-04-28,10.1002/jcu.24034,https://doi.org/10.1002/jcu.24034,,Paid,Flow Reserve Does Not Predict Long Term Outcomes After Transaortic Valve Implantation in Patients With Preserved Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction SÆVIK 2025,Not available,"['Transaortic Valve Implantation', 'Ventricular Ejection Fraction', 'Left Ventricular Ejection', 'Preserved Left Ventricular', 'Ejection Fraction', 'Left Ventricular', 'left ventricular function', 'Ventricular Ejection', 'Preserved Left', 'Flow Reserve']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['aortic stenosis', 'dobutamine stress echocardiography', 'flow reserve', 'outcomes', 'prognostic value']"
40287133,"Temporal Trends in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Outcomes in Patients With Low-Flow, Low-Gradient Aortic Stenosis: Insights From the TOPAS-TAVI Registry.","BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) technology and techniques have continuously improved, but data on their impact in low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis (LFLG-AS) remain limited. In particular, scarce data exist comparing the results of TAVR with new-generation devices vs early-generation devices in these patients. This study evaluated the temporal trends in TAVR practices among LFLG-AS patients.
METHODS: This multicentre registry included 424 consecutive LFLG-AS patients undergoing TAVR from 2007 to 2023, stratified by device generation: new-generation devices (n = 193) and early-generation devices (n = 231). All-cause mortality or heart failure hospitalisation (HFH) at 1-year follow-up was the primary end point.
RESULTS: The median Society of Thoracic Surgeons score was lower in the new-generation group (5.3% [interquartile range [IQR] 3.4%-8.2%] vs 7.4% [IQR 5.0%-12.1%]; P < 0.001), whereas left ventricular ejection fractions(LVEFs) were similar (new: 31.2 ± 8.3%; early: 30.0 ± 8.8%; P = 0.16). New-generation devices were associated with a significant reduction in moderate-to-severe paravalvular leak after TAVR (2.6% vs 9.1%; P = 0.005), but 30-day mortality was similar (new: 1.6%; early: 3.9%; P = 0.15). At 1 year, new-generation devices were associated with a greater LVEF improvement (43.8 ± 12.5% vs 39.8 ± 11.5%; P = 0.003), but without a significant reduction in all-cause mortality or HFH (new: 23.8%; early: 28.1%; P = 0.32). Chronic kidney disease and low hemoglobin independently predicted worse outcomes (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite procedural improvements with new-generation TAVR devices, clinical outcomes in LFLG-AS patients remain suboptimal. LVEF significantly improved after TAVR with new-generation devices but failed to translate into improved clinical outcomes. These findings suggest that TAVR alone may not suffice in this population and underscore the need for a comprehensive therapeutic approach that integrates TAVR with optimised medical management and cardiac rehabilitation.","['Siddhartha Mengi', 'Luis Nombela-Franco', 'Pedro Cepas-Guillén', 'Stamatios Lerakis', 'Raj Makkar', 'Tarun Chakravarty', 'Vassilis Babaliaros', 'Henrique Barbosa Ribeiro', 'Emilie Pelletier-Beaumont', 'Philippe Pibarot', 'Josep Rodés-Cabau']",The Canadian journal of cardiology,2025-04-24,10.1016/j.cjca.2025.04.015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2025.04.015,,Paid,Temporal Trends in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Outcomes in Patients With Low Flow Low Gradient Aortic Stenosis Insights From the TOPAS TAVI Registry MENGI 2025,Not available,"['Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Low-Gradient Aortic Stenosis', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'Aortic Stenosis', 'Aortic Valve', 'Valve Replacement', 'Low-Gradient Aortic', 'Valve Replacement Outcomes', 'TAVR']",2025-05-12,Pending,[]
40286377,Human Epididymis Protein 4 in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation: Diagnostic and Prognostic Value.,"BACKGROUND: The utility of the human epididymis protein 4 (HE4) in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has not been established yet.
OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed at examining the prognostic value of HE4 in patients undergoing TAVI.
METHODS: In this prospective study, the prognostic value of HE4 to predict adverse clinical events was evaluated in 362 patients who underwent TAVI. The association between HE4 and diffuse myocardial fibrosis was also assessed using T1 mapping on cardiac magnetic resonance in a subgroup of 43 patients.
RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 2.5 (IQR: 1.9-3.2) years, 34/362 (9.4%) patients were rehospitalized for heart failure, 99/362 (27.3%) died, and 113/362 (31.2%) met the composite endpoint of rehospitalization for heart failure or all-cause mortality. In multivariable Cox regression analyses, patients with higher HE4 serum levels (ie, HE4 ≥130 pmol/L) vs lower serum levels (ie, HE4 <130 pmol/L) had increased risk of all-cause mortality (adjusted HR: 3.26 [95% CI: 2.04-5.20], P < 0.001), and of the composite endpoint (adjusted HR: 2.48 [95% CI: 1.64-3.74], P < 0.001) following TAVI, respectively. Patients with higher HE4 serum levels had higher median native T1 mapping values (1,278 [95% CI: 1,239-1,280] ms vs 1,352 [95% CI: 1,303-1,376] ms, P < 0.001) at 1 to 3 months following the procedure.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated HE4 serum levels are associated with diffuse myocardial fibrosis and increased risk of adverse clinical events following TAVI.

40283668,Review Article: Contemporary Transcatheter Heart Valves for TAVI in Bicuspid Aortic Anatomy.,"Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most common congenital heart disease, affecting 0.5-2% of the population and often leading to early aortic valve degeneration. While surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) remains the gold standard for treating severe bicuspid aortic stenosis (AS), transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is emerging as a viable alternative in selected BAV anatomies. Initial experiences with first-generation transcatheter heart valves (THVs) showed the feasibility of this technique, but were associated with lower device success rates and higher complications, such as paravalvular leak (PVL) and pacemaker implantation. Advancements in second- and third- generation THVs, together with better pre-procedural imaging assessment and growing operator experience, have significantly enhanced TAVI outcomes in BAV patients, with results now comparable to those seen in tricuspid aortic valves (TAVs). Proper patient selection, pre-procedural sizing, and device implantation are key to improving TAVI success in BAV. Recent registry data on contemporary THV platforms demonstrate improved procedural success, hemodynamic performance, and the safety of TAVI in BAV. However, higher rates of PVL, pacemaker implantation, and strokes remain concerns. Ongoing advancements in THV design and procedural techniques will further enhance outcomes for this challenging population. Up to the present, there are no dedicated THVs for BAV, but the latest-generation THVs offer promising results.","['Chrysavgi Simopoulou', 'Omar Oliva', 'Vincenzo Cesario', 'Nicolas Dumonteil', 'Didier Tchetche', 'Chiara De Biase']",Journal of clinical medicine,2025-04-20,10.3390/jcm14082838,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm14082838,PMC12027816,Free,Review Article Contemporary Transcatheter Heart Valves for TAVI in Bicuspid Aortic Anatomy SIMOPOULOU 2025,pdfs\Review Article Contemporary Transcatheter Heart Valves for TAVI in Bicuspid Aortic Anatomy SIMOPOULOU 2025.pdf,"['aortic valve', 'BAV', 'TAVI', 'Bicuspid aortic valve', 'Transcatheter Heart Valves', 'Bicuspid Aortic', 'Aortic', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'aortic valve implantation', 'valve']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['balloon-expandable valve (BEV)', 'bicuspid aortic valve (BAV)', 'paravalvular leak (PVL)', 'permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI)', 'self-expanding valve (SEV)', 'transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI)']"
40283521,Aortic Stenosis: Time for a Sex-Based Approach?,"Aortic stenosis (AS) is a progressive form of valvular heart disease most commonly associated with aging, with an exponential increase in prevalence after age 50. While men have historically been considered at higher risk, recent studies highlight a similar prevalence between men and women, with a higher prevalence in elderly women driven by longer life expectancy. Sex-related differences in clinical presentation, anatomy, and pathophysiology influence disease progression, severity assessment, and management. Women are often diagnosed at more advanced stages, exhibiting more pronounced symptoms, typically dyspnea and functional impairment, whereas men more often report chest pain. Women have a smaller body surface area, leading to smaller aortic annuli, left ventricular outflow tracts, aortic roots impacting flow dynamic, and severity grading. Diagnostic challenge contributes to the undertreatment of women. Despite experiencing severe AS, women receive fewer interventions and face delays in treatment. The advent of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) improved outcomes, with studies suggesting a potential advantage in women compared to men. However, the anatomical differences, such as smaller annuli and more tortuous vascular access, necessitate tailored procedural approaches. Recognizing these sex-specific differences is essential to optimizing AS management, ensuring timely interventions, and improving patient outcomes. Future strategies should incorporate sex-specific thresholds for diagnosis and treatment while leveraging technological advancements, such as artificial intelligence, for personalized therapeutic decisions.","['Aurelia Zimmerli', 'Quentin Liabot', 'Georgios Tzimas', 'Mariama Akodad', 'Adil Salihu', 'Victor Weerts', 'Panagiotis Antiochos', 'Stephanie L Sellers', 'Pierre Monney', 'Olivier Muller', 'Stephane Fournier', 'David Meier']",Journal of clinical medicine,2025-04-15,10.3390/jcm14082691,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm14082691,PMC12028251,Free,Aortic Stenosis Time for a Sex Based Approach?

40269992,CT-derived adipose tissue characteristics and TAVI all-cause mortality and complications: a systematic review.,"Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) has revolutionized severe aortic stenosis treatment, but risk stratification remains challenging. This systematic review examined the association between computed tomography (CT)-derived adipose tissue parameters and TAVI outcomes. We searched major databases for studies on visceral (VAT), subcutaneous (SAT), and intramuscular (IMAT) adipose tissue parameters and post-TAVI outcomes. Fourteen studies (9692 patients) were included. Higher SAT area/volume was consistently associated with better survival (5 studies, HR range: 0.83-2.77, p < 0.05). Lower SAT and VAT density also correlated with better survival (5 and 4 studies, respectively, HR range: 1.31-1.46, p < 0.05). VAT area showed mixed results. A VAT:SAT ratio < 1 was associated with better cardiovascular outcomes in one study. Lower IMAT index correlated with shorter hospital stays in a single study. This review reveals complex relationships between adipose tissue parameters and TAVI outcomes. Lower adipose tissue density and higher subcutaneous adiposity were most consistently associated with better outcomes. These findings suggest that detailed analysis of adipose tissue characteristics may enhance risk stratification in TAVI candidates.","['Matej Pekar', 'Piotr Branny', 'Otakar Jiravsky', 'Radim Spacek', 'Jan Alexander Mohr', 'Ivan Ranic', 'Bogna Jiravska Godula', 'Alica Cesnakova Konecna', 'Marek Kantor', 'Jan Hecko', 'Radek Neuwirth', 'Libor Sknouril', 'Jan Novak']",European journal of medical research,2025-04-24,10.1186/s40001-025-02587-3,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40001-025-02587-3,PMC12020199,Free,CT derived adipose tissue characteristics and TAVI all cause mortality and complications a systematic review PEKAR 2025,pdfs\CT derived adipose tissue characteristics and TAVI all cause mortality and complications a systematic review PEKAR 2025.pdf,"['adipose tissue', 'adipose tissue parameters', 'TAVI', 'tissue parameters', 'tissue', 'adipose', 'Czech Republic', 'adipose tissue characteristics', 'TAVI outcomes', 'CT-derived adipose tissue']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Adipose tissue parameters', 'CT-derived body composition', 'Risk stratification', 'Subcutaneous fat', 'TAVI outcomes', 'Visceral fat']"

40266968,Five-Year Mortality of Surgical and Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in the Real-World Scenario: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Propensity Score Matching Studies.,"INTRODUCTION: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) provide evidence of efficacy, while real-world data (RWD) demonstrate effectiveness in real-world practice. We designed a systematic review and meta-analysis of reconstructed time-to-event (RTE) data from propensity score matching studies comparing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) to compare their effectiveness and evaluate the generalizability of TAVI indications.
METHODS: Systematic review of literature between 2007 and 2023 including propensity score matching studies comparing TAVI or SAVR that reported at least one-year Kaplan-Meier curves of endpoints.
RESULTS: Twenty-one studies were included (39538 participants). TAVI shows a higher all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.41; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.34-1.47, P-value < 0.001), with a significant heterogeneity. The analysis of HR trend over time shows that TAVI superiority is limited to the first month with a steep reversal afterwards, when SAVR becomes clearly superior. All-cause mortality is significantly higher in TAVI in low-risk (HR 1.35; 95% CI 1.08-1.69, P-value < 0.001) as well as in intermediate (HR 1.73; 95% CI 1.35-2.22, P-value < 0.001) and high-risk (HR 1.61; 95% CI 1.38-1.88, P-value < 0.001) patients. The HR trend in the subgroups of risk confirms the data from the whole mixed population.
CONCLUSION: In a real-word setting, TAVI is associated with higher incidence of all-cause death and maintains a survival benefit only in the first month after implantation. These results show that TAVI effectiveness may not reflect the efficacy demonstrated by RCTs and pose a threat to their external validity.","['Mateo Marin-Cuartas', 'Bianca Dalbesio', 'Francesco Pollari', 'Matteo Scarpanti', 'Amedeo Anselmi', 'Manuela de la Cuesta', 'Miguel Sousa Uva', 'Jean-Philippe Verhoye', 'Francesco Musumeci', 'Fabio Barili', 'Alessandro Parolari']",Brazilian journal of cardiovascular surgery,2025-04-23,10.21470/1678-9741-2024-0048,https://doi.org/10.21470/1678-9741-2024-0048,PMC12017277,Free,Five Year Mortality of Surgical and Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in the Real World Scenario A Systematic Review and Meta Analysis of Propensity Score Matching Studies MARIN-CUARTAS 2025,pdfs\Five Year Mortality of Surgical and Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in the Real World Scenario A Systematic Review and Meta Analysis .pdf,"['Cardiac Surgery', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Aortic Valve Replacement', 'TAVI', 'Aortic Valve', 'Propensity Score Matching', 'studies comparing TAVI', 'Score Matching Studies', 'surgical aortic valve', 'Cardiac Surgery Unit']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Aortic Valve', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Systematic Review', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement']"
40261426,The implementation of a streamlined TAVI patient pathway across five European countries: BENCHMARK registry.,"BACKGROUND: Benchmark best practices have been shown to streamline the clinical pathway for patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), but the impact in diverse health systems is unknown.
AIMS: We evaluated the impact of Benchmark best practices implementation in Germany, Austria, France, Spain, and Italy.
METHODS: International, multicentre registry of severe symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) patients undergoing TAVI with a balloon-expandable valve, before and after Benchmark best practices implementation. Objectives were to reduce overall and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LoS), and to document 30-day safety.
RESULTS: A total of 890 patients were analysed in France, 454 in Spain, 362 in Germany, 300 in Italy, and 176 in Austria. Patients had the highest surgical risk in Germany (EuroSCORE II 6.8 ± 7.3%) and lowest in Spain (3.8 ± 2.6%). Austrian patients reported higher rates of prior myocardial infarction, severe pulmonary hypertension, and aortic valve-related symptoms at baseline. After the implementation of Benchmark best practices, the median hospital LoS was significantly reduced in France (5 vs. 3 days, p < 0.001), Spain (6 vs. 4, p < 0.001), Germany (9 vs. 6, p < 0.001), and Italy (7 vs. 5, p < 0.001); reductions in median ICU LoS were reported in France (1.1 vs. 0 days, p < 0.001), Spain (1.9 vs. 1, p < 0.001), and Germany (1 vs. 0.9, p = 0.004). Across all countries, 30-day safety outcomes were uncompromised and reduced rates of major vascular complications rates were observed in Germany (5.9 vs. 0.0%, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The implementation of Benchmark best practices in diverse European healthcare systems resulted in reduced hospital and ICU LoS without compromising patient safety.

AIMS: We aimed to assess different strategies of PCI timing in this high-risk TAVI cohort.
METHODS: The ASCoP registry retrospectively included patients with a clinical indication for both TAVI and PCI with at least 1 criterion of complex or high-risk PCI. The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause death and unplanned rehospitalisation for cardiovascular causes. The secondary endpoint was a composite of all-cause death, stroke, acute myocardial infarction, major bleeding, major vascular complication and unplanned revascularisation. Multivariable analysis was used to adjust for possible confounders.
RESULTS: A total of 519 patients were included: 363 (69.9%) underwent staged procedures and 156 (30.1%) concomitant TAVI and PCI. After 441 (interquartile range 182-824) days, the primary endpoint occurred in 151 (36.5%) cases, without any significant difference between the 2 groups (p=0.98), while the secondary endpoint occurred more frequently in the concomitant group (n=36 [25.8%] vs n=57 [17.4%]; p=0.014).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing TAVI and complex/high-risk PCI, a concomitant strategy is associated with a higher rate of adverse events and increased procedural risk.

40259836,Prognostic value of invasive versus echocardiography-derived aortic gradient in patients undergoing TAVI.,"BACKGROUND: Recent studies report a discordance between invasive and echocardiography-derived gradients after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) with balloon-expandable (BEV) and self-expanding valves (SEV). There are limited data on the determinants and clinical implications of this discordance.
AIMS: We aimed to examine the prognostic value of invasive and echocardiography-derived gradients after implantation of SEV and BEV and to compare gradients for SEV versus BEV.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective, propensity score-matched study. Invasive measurements were obtained before and immediately after TAVI. Echocardiography was performed before and within 24 hours after TAVI, and at 1 year. Clinical outcomes were assessed at 30 days, 1 year, and 2 years.
RESULTS: The 1:1 propensity score matching resulted in 436 matched pairs (436 SAPIEN 3 and 436 Evolut). Invasive gradients post-TAVI independently predicted higher risk for all-cause mortality at 30 days, 1 year and 2 years as a continuous variable (hazard ratio [HR] 1.07, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.00-1.14; p=0.038; HR 1.06, 95% CI: 1.01-1.11; p=0.007; HR 1.05, 95% CI: 1.01-1.09; p=0.011, respectively) and by using >10 mmHg as a cutoff (HR 1.95, 95% CI: 1.13-4.78; p=0.028; HR 1.91, 95% CI: 1.11-3.65; p=0.030; HR 1.61, 95% CI: 1.03-2.96; p=0.021, respectively), but echocardiography-derived gradients did not (HR 1.13, 95% CI: 0.87-1.75; p=0.247; HR 1.02, 95% CI: 0.95-1.10; p=0.639; HR 0.99, 95% CI: 0.94-1.07; p=0.979, respectively). Mean gradients before and after TAVI were higher by echocardiography than by invasive measurements. The difference was more pronounced after implantation with BEV than SEV (7.0 [25th-75th percentile: 4.0-11.0] mmHg vs 5.0 [2.0-7.0] mmHg; p<0.001). Smaller valve size, higher ejection fraction and higher stroke volume amplified the discordance. Invasive mean gradients were similar after SEV and BEV (3.0 [0.0-6.0] mmHg vs 3.0 [0.0-6.0] mmHg; p=0.166), but echo-derived mean gradients were lower after SEV versus BEV (8.0 [6.0-11.0] mmHg vs 11.0 [8.0-14.0] mmHg; p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Only invasively measured but not echocardiography-derived transvalvular mean gradients correlate with 30-day, 1-year and 2-year mortality. Aortic gradient measurements are higher by echocardiography than by invasive assessment and more so for BEV than SEV. Smaller valve size, higher ejection fraction and higher stroke volume increase this discordance between echocardiography and invasive assessment.","['Mark M P van den Dorpel', 'Sraman Chatterjee', 'Rik Adrichem', 'Sarah Verhemel', 'Isabella Kardys', 'Rutger-Jan Nuis', 'Joost Daemen', 'Claire Ben Ren', 'Alexander Hirsch', 'Marcel L Geleijnse', 'Nicolas M Van Mieghem']",EuroIntervention : journal of EuroPCR in collaboration with the Working Group on Interventional Cardiology of the European Society of Cardiology,2025-04-21,10.4244/EIJ-D-24-00341,https://doi.org/10.4244/EIJ-D-24-00341,PMC11995293,Paid,Prognostic value of invasive versus echocardiography derived aortic gradient in patients undergoing TAVI DORPEL 2025,Not downloaded,"['patients undergoing TAVI', 'SEV versus BEV', 'SEV', 'BEV', 'gradients', 'invasive', 'TAVI', 'mmHg', 'undergoing TAVI', 'echocardiography-derived gradients']",2025-05-12,Pending,[]
40258459,Association of Body Mass Index With Procedural Success and Outcomes in Patients undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.,"Obesity is a major public health concern linked to adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Recent studies suggest an obesity paradox, showing lower mortality in obese patients after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). This study investigates the impact of body mass index (BMI) on procedural and long-term clinical outcomes in patients undergoing TAVI. Patients undergoing TAVI at two high-volume centers were analyzed and categorized into four BMI groups: underweight (BMI <18.5 kg/m2), normal (BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/m2), overweight (BMI 25.0-29.9 kg/m2), and obese (BMI ≥30.0 kg/m2). To relax the proportional hazards assumption, restricted cubic splines were constructed. The primary outcome was procedural success and safety, including 30-day all-cause-mortality, stroke, and overall bleeding. Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality at one and five years. In total, 6,156 patients were included: 114 (1.8%) were underweight, 2,393 (38.8%) normal weight, 2,380 (38.6%) overweight, and 1,269 (20.6%) obese. No significant differences between BMI groups were found in 30-day mortality, stroke, or bleeding. However, underweight patients had higher mortality compared to normal-weight patients at one year (23.7 vs 13.2%, p = 0.001) and five years (53.2% vs. 44.0%, p = 0.048). Obese patients had similar mortality to normal-weight patients at one year (11.4 vs 13.2%, p = 0.120) and five years (41.0 vs 44.0%, p = 0.200). Obesity showed no outcome advantage over normal weight, while underweight was an independent predictor of higher all-cause mortality after TAVI. These findings challenge the obesity paradox in the context of TAVI.","['Jakob J Reichl', 'Adisa Poljo', 'Thorald Stolte', 'Ramona Schmitt', 'Jasper Boeddinghaus', 'Max Wagener', 'Gregor Leibundgut', 'Christoph Kaiser', 'Dirk Westermann', 'Tau Hartikainen', 'Felix Mahfoud', 'Philipp Ruile', 'Philipp Breitbart', 'Thomas Nestelberger']",The American journal of cardiology,2025-04-19,10.1016/j.amjcard.2025.04.012,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjcard.2025.04.012,,Paid,Association of Body Mass Index With Procedural Success and Outcomes in Patients undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation REICHL 2025,Not available,"['Aortic Valve Implantation', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Body Mass Index', 'Valve Implantation', 'Aortic Valve', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'undergoing Transcatheter Aortic', 'BMI', 'patients undergoing TAVI', 'Body Mass']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Aortic stenosis', 'Body Mass Index', 'Obesity', 'Obesity paradox', 'Transcatheter aortic valve implantation', 'Underweight']"
40257711,High-flow oxygenation therapy for a sedated elderly frail patient with hiccups undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation.,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) can be performed under sedation, but body movements may lower the efficacy of the procedure and may increase the risk of complications, such as cardiac tamponade. Additional sedatives and analgesics may be required to prevent body movements; this would increase the risk of upper airway obstruction and of respiratory depression. We report a frail patient with hypoxemia and hiccups, in whom high-flow nasal oxygenation facilitated TAVI by effectively inhibiting body movements and respiratory complications.
CASE PRESENTATION: In an 82-year-old patient with severe aortic stenosis, heart failure, hypoxemia, and hiccups, TAVI was planned under sedation with dexmedetomidine, fentanyl, and ketamine. High-flow nasal oxygenation effectively prevented hiccups and associated body movements, and prevented upper airway obstruction and respiratory depression, during TAVI.
CONCLUSIONS: High-flow nasal oxygenation therapy is potentially useful during cardiac catheterization procedure under monitored anesthesia care, in elderly frail patients with reduced cardiopulmonary function.","['Ryosuke Osawa', 'Takero Arai', 'Takashi Asai']",JA clinical reports,2025-04-21,10.1186/s40981-025-00784-x,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40981-025-00784-x,PMC12011683,Free,High flow oxygenation therapy for a sedated elderly frail patient with hiccups undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation OSAWA 2025,pdfs\High flow oxygenation therapy for a sedated elderly frail patient with hiccups undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation OSAWA 2025.pdf,"['high-flow nasal oxygenation', 'high-flow nasal', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'nasal oxygenation', 'body movements', 'aortic valve implantation', 'aortic valve', 'TAVI', 'upper airway obstruction', 'nasal oxygenation therapy']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Conscious sedation', 'High-flow nasal oxygenation therapy', 'Transcatheter aortic valve implantation']"
40248303,Aortic and mitral structural interventions in the absence of cardiac surgery.,"Traditionally, structural heart interventions have been performed at heart valve centres with on-site heart surgery to maximize expertise and deal with complications requiring emergent cardiac surgery (ECS). However, at present, only transcatheter aortic-valve implantation (TAVI) must be performed at centres with on-site heart surgery according to current guidelines, while mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair, or left appendage atrial occlusion could be performed also in centres without on-site cardiac surgery. Today, ageing of the population and improved results of TAVI have increased the need for such procedures posing strong pressure to traditional heart valve centres, prolonging waiting times for TAVI and increasing access disparities. Fortunately, TAVI procedures have a very low rate of complications, including those necessitating ECS, and observational data suggest that TAVI can be safely performed in centres without on-site cardiac surgery. However, guideline recommendations need randomized clinical trials like the TRanscatheter Aortic-Valve Implantation with or without on-site Cardiac Surgery (TRACS) trial to be updated. The TRACS trial randomizes high-risk symptomatic aortic stenosis patients to treatment by the same operators either at centres with or without on-site cardiac surgery and compares 1-year follow-up. Key issues for structural interventions, in particular TAVI, at centres without on-site surgery are shared indications through heart team evaluation, consistent experiences and competences of non-surgical centres, and strong networking with the Hub centre. The increasing demand for structural heart interventions highlights the need for innovative care models and the careful introduction of a 'Hub-and-Spoke' approach for high-volume heart valve networks could be a study option.","['Gianmarco Iannopollo', 'Alessandro Capecchi', 'Roberto Verardi', 'Luigi Biasco', 'Chiara Pedone', 'Valerio Lanzilotti', 'Matteo Bruno', 'Giampiero Nobile', 'Gianni Casella']",European heart journal supplements : journal of the European Society of Cardiology,2025-03-12,10.1093/eurheartjsupp/suaf038,https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartjsupp/suaf038,PMC12001765,Free,Aortic and mitral structural interventions in the absence of cardiac surgery IANNOPOLLO 2025,pdfs\Aortic and mitral structural interventions in the absence of cardiac surgery IANNOPOLLO 2025.pdf,"['on-site cardiac surgery', 'on-site heart surgery', 'cardiac surgery', 'TAVI', 'on-site cardiac', 'heart valve centres', 'surgery', 'structural heart interventions', 'heart', 'heart surgery']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Heart surgery', 'TAVI', 'TEER']"
40248298,Ten years of transcatheter aortic valve implantation in the NOTION study: the good and the bad.,"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has transformed the treatment of severe aortic stenosis, becoming a preferred option for patients at high and moderate surgical risk and for individuals over 75 years of age. The NOTION study represents the first randomized clinical trial to reach a 10-year follow-up in patients at low surgical risk, comparing TAVI with surgical valve replacement (SAVR). The results show comparable clinical outcomes between TAVI and SAVR in terms of all-cause mortality, stroke, and myocardial infarction. TAVI demonstrated a better haemodynamic profile and a lower incidence of structural valve deterioration (SVD), but showed higher rates of pacemaker requirement and paravalvular leakage compared with surgical replacement. The trial highlights the excellent durability of transcatheter bioprostheses, although new-generation devices and advanced techniques could further reduce adverse events. The study confirms the increasing role of TAVI even in younger patients, but further long-term data will be needed to evaluate its full potential.","['Luigi Ferrarotto', 'Sebastiano Immè', 'Claudia Tamburino', 'Corrado Tamburino']",European heart journal supplements : journal of the European Society of Cardiology,2025-03-12,10.1093/eurheartjsupp/suaf039,https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartjsupp/suaf039,PMC12001784,Free,Ten years of transcatheter aortic valve implantation in the NOTION study the good and the bad FERRAROTTO 2025,pdfs\Ten years of transcatheter aortic valve implantation in the NOTION study the good and the bad FERRAROTTO 2025.pdf,"['TAVI', 'SAVR', 'TAVI group', 'patients', 'SAVR group', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'aortic valve', 'aortic valve implantation', 'valve', 'surgical valve replacement']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Commissural alignment', 'NOTION study', 'Severe aortic stenosis', 'TAVI (transcatheter aortic valve implantation)', 'Valvular structural deterioration (SVD)']"
40248296,Even aortic insufficiency can be treated percutaneously: right?,"Moderate or severe aortic insufficiency (AI) is a relatively rare condition but with significant clinical implications, especially in elderly patients at high surgical risk. Although surgical aortic valve replacement remains the gold standard for treatment, a significant proportion of patients are not eligible due to the high surgical risk. In recent years, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has revolutionized the treatment of aortic stenosis, but its application to AI has encountered significant challenges, mainly related to specific anatomical characteristics of this population. This review provides an overview of the evolution of the transcatheter treatment of AI, highlighting the critical issues of first-generation TAVI devices and the improvements achieved with new-generation and dedicated devices, such as JenaValve and J-Valve. Preliminary data demonstrate encouraging procedural results, including a reduction in residual insufficiency and improved safety in patients at high surgical risk. However, limitations remain, including the high incidence of pacemaker implantation and the lack of long-term randomized clinical trials. In light of technological advances, TAVI represents a promising therapeutic option for selected patients with AI, if performed in high-volume centres with extensive experience in the treatment of aortic disease.","['Nicolò Azzola Guicciardi', 'Alessandro Beneduce', 'Francesco Maisano']",European heart journal supplements : journal of the European Society of Cardiology,2025-03-12,10.1093/eurheartjsupp/suaf026,https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartjsupp/suaf026,PMC12001779,Free,Even aortic insufficiency can be treated percutaneously right?

40240943,Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction Phenotype Is Associated With Early Symptom Onset in Aortic Stenosis and Residual Symptoms After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.,"BACKGROUND: Aortic stenosis can lead to cardiac adaptations and symptoms similar to heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. We hypothesized that a heart failure with preserved ejection fraction phenotype in aortic stenosis is associated with earlier onset of symptoms and reduced symptomatic response after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).
METHODS AND RESULTS: This retrospective cohort study included 469 patients with moderate aortic stenosis. We determined heavy, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary, elder, filling pressure (H2FPEF) score at diagnosis and compared aortic peak jet velocity at onset of dyspnea in patients with low (<6) and high (≥6) H2FPEF score. In a separate cohort of 601 patients undergoing TAVI, we compared New York Heart Association class, NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide), and cardiovascular mortality post-TAVI between patients with low and high H2FPEF scores. In patients with aortic stenosis and a high H2FPEF score (n=43, 9.2%), the median peak jet velocity at onset of dyspnea was 4.2 versus 4.4 m/s in patients with a low H2FPEF score (P<0.001). After TAVI, a high H2FPEF score (n=123, 20%) was associated with a lower proportion of New York Heart Association class I at 30 days (49% versus 61%; P=0.04), persistently elevated NT-proBNP, and higher 5-year rate of cardiovascular mortality (36% versus 30%; P=0.012), compared with a low H2FPEF score.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with aortic stenosis with a heart failure with preserved ejection fraction phenotype are more likely to develop symptoms at lower gradients and have worse outcomes post-TAVI. Randomized trials are warranted to investigate whether medical therapy targeted at heart failure with preserved ejection fraction delays onset of symptoms and improves symptomatic response after TAVI.","['Constantijn S Venema', 'Kees H van Bergeijk', 'Jan A Krikken', 'Hindrik W van der Werf', 'Ad F M van den Heuvel', 'Yvonne L Douglas', 'Ify R Mordi', 'Nicolas Girerd', 'Chim C Lang', 'Carolyn S P Lam', 'Martin B Leon', 'Erik Lipsic', 'Michiel Rienstra', 'Adriaan A Voors', 'Joanna J Wykrzykowska']",Journal of the American Heart Association,2025-05-06,10.1161/JAHA.124.038786,https://doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.124.038786,,Paid,Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction Phenotype Is Associated With Early Symptom Onset in Aortic Stenosis and Residual Symptoms After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation VENEMA 2025,Not available,"['Preserved Ejection Fraction', 'Ejection Fraction Phenotype', 'Aortic Valve Implantation', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Early Symptom Onset', 'Failure With Preserved', 'Preserved Ejection', 'Ejection Fraction', 'Aortic Stenosis', 'Heart Failure']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['H2FPEF score', 'aortic stenosis', 'aortic valve intervention', 'heart failure', 'structural heart disease']"
40240155,Factors Contributing to Hospital-Associated Disability in Elderly Patients After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.,"BACKGROUND: Hospital-associated disability (HAD), characterized by a worsening of activities of daily living and physical function following hospitalization, is a common complication in older adults during the course of acute care hospitalization. HAD is a significant concern affecting older adults undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).
METHODS AND RESULTS: This retrospective study investigated 243 consecutive patients who underwent elective transfemoral TAVI between January 2016 and April 2022. HAD was defined as a decrease of at least 1 point in the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) assessed before discharge compared with before TAVI. Logistic regression identified the first ambulation day after TAVI as an independent predictor of HAD incidence (odds ratio 1.500; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.115-2.008; P=0.007). Patients with HAD had significantly lower body mass index, hemoglobin, and albumin, and higher serum creatinine. All-cause mortality was significantly higher in patients with than without HAD (log-rank P<0.001). Kaplan-Meier analysis confirmed poorer survival in patients with HAD, regardless of the degree of decline in SPPB. Multivariate Cox analysis regression identified HAD as a predictor of all-cause death (hazard ratio 4.249; 95% CI 1.798-10.04; P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The timing of the first ambulation was associated with the incidence of HAD. Promoting early mobilization may reduce the risk of HAD after TAVI.","['Masashi Shimizu', 'Atsushi Shibata', 'Kodai Taniguchi', 'Tomohiro Yamaguchi', 'Mitsuhiko Ikebuchi', 'Takanori Yamazaki', 'Yosuke Takahashi', 'Terai Hidetomi', 'Toshihiko Shibata', 'Daiju Fukuda']",Circulation journal : official journal of the Japanese Circulation Society,2025-04-17,10.1253/circj.CJ-24-0710,https://doi.org/10.1253/circj.CJ-24-0710,,Paid,Factors Contributing to Hospital Associated Disability in Elderly Patients After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation SHIMIZU 2025,Not available,"['Aortic Valve Implantation', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Factors Contributing', 'Hospital-Associated Disability', 'Valve Implantation', 'Aortic Valve', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'Elderly Patients', 'Contributing to Hospital-Associated', 'Disability in Elderly']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Early mobilization', 'Hospital-associated disability', 'Transcatheter aortic valve implantation']"

40224373,Incidence rate of infective endocarditis by socioeconomic position: a Danish nationwide cohort study (2000-2022).,"BACKGROUND: People with lower socioeconomic positions have a higher risk of cardiac and infectious diseases than those with higher socioeconomic positions. However, how the increasing incidence of infective endocarditis among different socioeconomic groups has played out remains unclear. We therefore aimed to investigate nationwide temporal trends in infective endocarditis incidence rate by socioeconomic position in Denmark.
METHODS: Using nationwide Danish registries, we investigated infective endocarditis incidence rate (2000-2022). As socioeconomic position indicator, we used affluence level (accounting for household-level income and wealth), dividing the population into low, medium, and high affluence. Average annual percentage changes were computed to evaluate temporal trends. Slope index and relative index of inequality were calculated to obtain inequality gradients.
FINDINGS: Per 100,000 person-years, the incidence rate increased from 8.7 in 2000 to 21.2 in 2022 among low; from 7.4 to 14.3 among medium; and from 6.2 to 13.1 among high affluence people. The average annual percentage change was 4.3% among low, 3.5% among medium, and 3.7% among high affluence people. The slope index of inequality increased from 3.8 additional cases per 100,000 person years (95% CI: 0.4-7.3) in 2000 to 12.3 (95% CI: 7.4-17.1) in 2022. The relative index of inequality increased from 1.68 (95% CI: 0.90-2.44) to 2.13 (95% CI: 1.49-2.78).
INTERPRETATION: The infective endocarditis incidence rates increased in all affluence levels, with highest rates consistently found in the lowest affluence group, indicating that people with lower socioeconomic positions faced a disproportionately higher risk of infective endocarditis. These findings highlight the need to consider socioeconomic factors when addressing modifiable determinants that may curb the rise in infective endocarditis incidence.

40222322,Geriatric assessment and results of transcatheter aortic valve implantation.,"INTRODUCTION: Comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) prior to transcatheter aortic valve replacement implantation (TAVI) for severe aortic stenosis (AS) may improve the selection of patients targeted for this strategy. Despite the fact that CGA includes multiple scales, comparative data among them are limited. Our aim was to evaluate the discriminative capacity of different scales used in CGA on the decision of suitability for TAVI implantation and the influence on prognosis after TAVI implantation.
METHODS: Single-center prospective observational study including consecutive patients with severe AS referred for TAVI implantation. A CGA was performed in all patients including scales of functionality, frailty, cognitive impairment and comorbidities. The predictive capacity of each of the scales was evaluated. The development of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE: cardiovascular mortality, heart failure [HF] and stroke) was analyzed during follow-up.
RESULTS: A total of 142 patients were selected as candidates for TAVI (80.2%), and 121 were finally implanted. The mean age was 83±4.9 years. Patients who were candidates for TAVI had less valvular area, less atrial fibrillation (AF), less cognitive impairment, more autonomy and less frailty. The SPPB frailty and Barthel functional assessment scales were the main scales of the CGA for the TAVI candidacy decision. After TAVI implantation, 21.5% presented a MACE event, with an overall mortality of 19.8% (6.6% cardiovascular). Patients with a higher rate of events and mortality had more AF, HF, renal disease and malnutrition, as well as less family coverage.
CONCLUSIONS: In elderly patients with severe AS, the CGA is a determining factor in the selection of candidates for TAVI, with frailty and functional assessment being the most important aspects. Family support and nutritional status have a high impact on the prognosis of patients after TAVI.","['Cristina de la Rubia-Molina', 'Andrez Felipe Cubides-Novoa', 'María Teresa Madrid-López', 'Elisa Patín-González', 'Verónica Merchán-Ordoñez', 'Martín Negreira-Caamaño', 'Javier Gil-Moreno', 'Alfonso Freites', 'Ignacio Sánchez-Pérez', 'Virginia Mazoteras-Muñoz', 'Jesús Piqueras-Flores']",Medicina clinica,2025-04-12,10.1016/j.medcli.2025.106936,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medcli.2025.106936,,Paid,Geriatric assessment and results of transcatheter aortic valve implantation RUBIA-MOLINA 2025,Not available,"['transcatheter aortic valve', 'TAVI', 'TAVI implantation', 'aortic valve implantation', 'Comprehensive geriatric assessment', 'transcatheter aortic', 'aortic valve', 'CGA', 'aortic valve replacement', 'patients']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Aortic stenosis', 'Cardio-geriatrics', 'Cardiogeriatría', 'Comprehensive geriatric assessment', 'Estenosis aórtica', 'Fragilidad', 'Frailty', 'Implante transcatéter de prótesis aórtica', 'Transcatheter aortic valve implantation', 'Valoración geriátrica integral']"
40214963,Long-term age-stratified outcomes after surgical and transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a Dutch cohort study.,"BACKGROUND: While randomised trials have shown that surgical and transcutaneous aortic valve replacement/implantation (SAVR/TAVI) have similar short- to mid-term outcomes, long-term outcome data are scarce. Additionally, no large-scale long-term follow-up data from Dutch databases and TAVI centres have been reported to inform national guidelines.
METHODS: We retrospectively analysed baseline characteristics, 5‑year mortality and re-intervention rates of patients undergoing isolated SAVR or TAVI, stratified by age (65-75, 75-80 and > 80 years old) in the Netherlands Heart Registry.
RESULTS: From 2013 through 2021, 7879 SAVR patients (median age: 73.0 years; interquartile range (IQR): 69.0-77.0; 43.7% female) and 14,461 TAVI patients (median age: 81.0 years; IQR: 77.0-84.0; 49.9% female) were treated in the Netherlands. Patients undergoing TAVI more frequently had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, dialysis, poor mobility, previous stroke, unstable angina and recent myocardial infarction compared with SAVR patients. This higher comorbidity rate in TAVI was observed across all age groups. After 5‑year follow-up, mortality rates were higher after TAVI compared with SAVR (35.5% vs 13.0%; p < 0.001). This difference decreased with increasing age (p for interaction < 0.001). While the aortic re-intervention rate was low in both cohorts, it was higher after SAVR than TAVI (1.9% vs 0.9%; p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Demographics of patients undergoing SAVR versus TAVI in the Netherlands differed substantially. TAVI patients were older and had more comorbidities than SAVR patients, across all age groups. Mortality rates were highest after TAVI, while aortic re-intervention was more common after SAVR. These findings reflect differences in baseline patient characteristics and current daily practice in decision-making by the Heart Teams.","['Kees van Bergeijk', 'Stijn Venema', 'Ad van den Heuvel', 'Rik van der Werf', 'Wobbe Bouma', 'Yvonne Douglas', 'Niki Medendorp', 'Marijke Timmermans', 'Adriaan Voors', 'Joanna J Wykrzykowska']",Netherlands heart journal : monthly journal of the Netherlands Society of Cardiology and the Netherlands Heart Foundation,2025-05-12,10.1007/s12471-025-01944-5,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12471-025-01944-5,PMC12014882,Free,Long term age stratified outcomes after surgical and transcatheter aortic valve replacement a Dutch cohort study BERGEIJK 2025,pdfs\Long term age stratified outcomes after surgical and transcatheter aortic valve replacement a Dutch cohort study BERGEIJK 2025.pdf,"['TAVI', 'SAVR', 'Netherlands Heart Registry', 'SAVR patients', 'SAVR versus TAVI', 'TAVI patients', 'Netherlands', 'Netherlands Heart', 'patients', 'Heart Registry']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Comorbidities', 'Long-term outcomes', 'SAVR', 'TAVI']"
40187364,"SAPIEN 3 versus Myval transcatheter heart valves for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (COMPARE-TAVI 1): a multicentre, randomised, non-inferiority trial.","BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is a guideline-directed treatment for severe aortic stenosis and degenerated aortic bioprostheses. When new transcatheter heart valve (THV) platforms for TAVI are launched, they should be compared with best-in-practice contemporary THVs for their short-term and long-term performance. The COMPARE-TAVI 1 trial was designed to provide a head-to-head comparison of the SAPIEN 3 or SAPIEN 3 Ultra THVs and the Myval or Myval Octacor THVs.
METHODS: This multicentre, all-comers, randomised, non-inferiority trial was done at three university hospitals in Denmark. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, scheduled for transfemoral TAVI, and eligible for treatment with SAPIEN 3 THVs or Myval THVs. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to treatment with SAPIEN 3 (29 mm diameter) or SAPIEN 3 Ultra (20 mm, 23 mm, or 26 mm diameter) THVs or Myval or Myval Octacor THVs (20-32 mm diameter). The TAVI procedure was performed according to local practice and under local anaesthesia unless leaflet laceration was performed. The primary endpoint was a composite of death, stroke, moderate or severe aortic regurgitation, or moderate or severe haemodynamic THV deterioration at 1 year according to Third Valve Academic Research Consortium criteria. All patients assigned to THV treatment were included in the intention-to-treat analysis, and all patients who were treated as randomly assigned were included in the per-protocol analysis. With an expected event rate of 13%, the prespecified non-inferiority margin was 5·3%. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04443023, and is closed to accrual.
FINDINGS: Between June 15, 2020, and Nov 3, 2023, 1031 patients were enrolled. Enrolment was paused twice because of patent-related legal proceedings. Of 1031 patients, 517 patients were randomly assigned to SAPIEN 3 THVs and 514 to Myval THVs. The median patient age was 81·6 years (IQR 77·6-85·0), and 415 (40%) of 1031 patients were female and 616 (60%) were male. The primary endpoint occurred in 67 (13%) of 517 patients randomly assigned to SAPIEN 3 THVs versus 71 (14%) of 514 patients randomly assigned to Myval THVs (risk difference -0·9% [one-sided upper 95% CI 4·4%]; pnon-inferiority=0·019).
INTERPRETATION: Myval THVs were non-inferior to SAPIEN 3 THVs in terms of a 1-year composite endpoint of death, stroke, moderate or severe aortic regurgitation, or moderate or severe haemodynamic THV deterioration.

40159704,Predictive power of ALBI score-based nomogram for 30-day mortality following transcatheter aortic valve implantation.,"AIM: This retrospective, multi-center study evaluates the relationships between novel liver function scoring systems - Albumin-Bilirubin (ALBI) score, EZ-ALBI, PALBI, and MELD-XI - and outcomes in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Feature importance was assessed with SHAP-values via the XGBoost-algorithm.
RESULTS: The ALBI score exhibited the strongest association with 30-day mortality after TAVI (AUC = 0.723, p < 0.001), outperforming other scores in this regard and consistently demonstrating predictive power across various subgroup populations. Higher 30-day mortality rates were observed in the higher tertiles of the ALBI score compared to the lower tertiles (log-rank p-value = 0.004). The ALBI-based nomogram (C-index = 0.81, 95% CI:0.73-0.86, p = 0 < 001) demonstrated superior predictive power for 30-day mortality post-TAVI compared to the STS (C-index = 0.71, 95% CI :0.64-0.77, p = 0 < 001). In addition, the nomogram showed a significant improvement in reclassification (69.3%, p < 0.001) and a stronger discrimination 15.2%, p < 0.001) compared to the STS. It integrates nine variables, first ALBI score (SHAP:1.165), including NYHA class (0.594), body mass index (0.510), glomerular filtration rate, creatinine, hemoglobin, gender, predilatation requirement, presence of chronic kidney disease, and providing a comprehensive risk assessment tool.
CONCLUSION: This study exhibits the significance of liver dysfunction with AS patients and suggests incorporating liver function parameters in pre-operative risk assessments for better clinical outcomes in TAVI procedures.","['Abdullah Yildirim', 'Omer Genc', 'Mert Evlice', 'Aslan Erdogan', 'Emre Pacaci', 'Ahmet Ozderya', 'Murat Gokhan Yerlikaya', 'Emre Sezici', 'Yeliz Guler', 'Omer Sen', 'Ahmet Guler', 'Ali Riza Akyuz', 'Levent Korkmaz', 'Ibrahim Halil Kurt']",Biomarkers in medicine,2025-05-12,10.1080/17520363.2025.2483157,https://doi.org/10.1080/17520363.2025.2483157,PMC12051588,Paid,Predictive power of ALBI score based nomogram for 30 day mortality following transcatheter aortic valve implantation YILDIRIM 2025,Not downloaded,"['aortic valve implantation', 'transcatheter aortic valve', 'valve implantation', 'ALBI score-based nomogram', 'aortic valve', 'ALBI score', 'transcatheter aortic', 'undergoing transcatheter aortic', 'ALBI score-based', 'ALBI']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['30-day mortality', 'ALBI', 'ALBI-based nomogram', 'STS PROM', 'TAVI', 'albumin-Bilirubin Score', 'severe aortic stenosis']"

40102102,Australian Cardiac Outcomes Registry of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation: Report and Update of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation in Australia.,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) procedures performed in Australia are recorded in the national Australian Cardiac Outcomes Registry (ACOR) TAVI Registry. Characteristics of patients and operators are prospectively collected with reference to patient demographics, procedural factors as well as outcomes related to both efficacy and safety metrics.
METHODS: Patient level data reported to the ACOR TAVI Registry from enrolled sites from registry inception up until 31 December 2021 were analysed. Key safety and efficacy metrics were identified and used to assess TAVI performance and outcomes in the Australian setting.
RESULTS: From 10 April 2018 to 31 December 2021, 9,881 consecutive patients underwent a TAVI procedure in Australia across 42 TAVI hospitals. The mean age of patients treated was 81.8 years (± standard deviation [SD] 7.1 years), 40.6% were female and the mean STS (Society for Thoracic Surgeons) score was 5.3% (±SD 4.4%). Overall, 0.3% of the cohort identified as Australian Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander peoples. All-cause mortality at 30 days and 12 months was 1.37% and 5.57% respectively. The 30-day rates of stroke, major vascular complications and newly implanted permanent pacemaker were 2.19%, 1.23% and 10.68% respectively. There were 181 unique primary operators who performed TAVI during this time with an annualised median number of 19 procedures per operator per year (interquartile range [IQR] 42.5) and 63% of operators performed <30 cases per year.

39981654,Impact of Continuation Versus Interruption of Oral Anticoagulation During TAVI on Health-Related Quality of Life.,"BACKGROUND: One-third of patients undergoing TAVR have a concomitant indication for oral anticoagulation. The impact of continuation as compared to interruption of oral anticoagulation during TAVR on health-related quality of life is unknown.
AIMS: To investigate the impact of continuation as compared to interruption of oral anticoagulation on health-related quality of life.
METHODS: The POPular PAUSE TAVI (Periprocedural Continuation vs. Interruption of Oral Anticoagulant Drugs during Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation) trial was an international, open-label, randomized, clinical trial performed at 22 European sites. Health-related quality of life was assessed using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) and Short Form-12 (SF-12) before, and at 1 and 3 months after TAVR.
RESULTS: A total of 8 patients were included: 431 were assigned to continuation and 427 to interruption of oral anticoagulation. Before TAVR, the mean overall KCCQ summary score was 53.6 (±26.0). At 1 month, the mean change in KCCQ summary score as compared to baseline was +11.4 points (95% confidence interval [CI] 8.0-14.8) in the continuation group and +12.2 points (95% CI 8.8-15.6) in the interruption group (difference -0.7 points; 95% CI -4.6 to 3.1). At 3 months, the mean change was +11.0 points (95% CI 7.3-14.6) versus +13.8 points (95% CI 10.2-17.4), respectively (difference -2.8 points; 95% CI -7.1 to 1.5). Mean changes in SF-12 physical and mental component summary scores showed no differences between both groups at 1 and 3 months after TAVR.

39971704,Impact of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation on Right Ventricular Function.,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence and predictors of right ventricular (RV) dysfunction before and after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) are not known. We aimed to document this and sought to identify specific RV echo thresholds, below which RV improvement was unlikely to occur.
METHOD: Consecutive patients who underwent TAVI between 2017 and 2021 at Macquarie University Hospital (MUH) were included if ≥2 RV functional parameters were available on baseline echo; tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, tissue Doppler (S') and/or RV fractional area change. Prevalence and predictors of baseline RV dysfunction were documented. Patients with a repeat echo performed at MUH at 1-3 months post-TAVI were included in further analyses to assess serial changes in RV function.
RESULTS: Overall, 343 patients had an eligible baseline echo and 97 of these patients (28.2%) had RV dysfunction, pre-TAVI. These patients had significantly higher rates of atrial fibrillation, ischaemic heart disease, and chronic lung disease, than those without (p<0.05 for all). Of 239 patients with 1-3 month follow-up echo data, 66 of these had had baseline RV dysfunction; of these, 20 (30.3%) patients showed improvement and 46 (69.7%) patients showed persistent RV dysfunction. Thresholds with a greater than 90% predictive value for persistent RV dysfunction were identified for each baseline RV functional parameter: tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion <1.4 cm, S'<6, fractional area change <25%.
CONCLUSIONS: Baseline RV dysfunction was present in over a quarter of pre-TAVI patients and persisted at short-term follow-up in over two-thirds of such patients.

39965432,Machine learning for predicting outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve implantation: A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) therapy has demonstrated its clear benefits such as low invasiveness, to treat aortic stenosis. Despite associated benefits, still post-procedural complications might occur. The severity of these complications depends on pre-existing clinical conditions and patient specific complex anatomical features. Accurate prediction of TAVI outcomes will assist in the precise risk assessment for patients undergoing TAVI. Throughout the past decade, different machine learning (ML) approaches have been utilized to predict outcomes of TAVI. This systematic review aims to assess the application of ML in TAVI for the purpose of outcome prediction.
METHODS: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline was adapted for searching the PubMed and Scopus databases on ML use in TAVI outcomes prediction. Once the studies that meet the inclusion criteria were identified, data from these studies were retrieved and were further examined. 17 parameters relevant to TAVI outcomes were carefully identified for assessing the quality of the included studies.
RESULTS: Following the search of the mentioned databases, 78 studies were initially retrieved, and 17 of these studies were included for further assessment. Most of the included studies focused on mortality prediction, utilizing datasets of varying sizes and diverse ML algorithms. The most employed ML algorithms were random forest, logistics regression, and gradient boosting. Among the studied parameters, serum creatinine, age, BMI, hemoglobin, and aortic valve mean gradient were identified as key predictors for TAVI outcomes. These predictors were found to be well aligned with established associations in current literature.
CONCLUSION: ML presents a promising opportunity for improving the success and safety of TAVI and enhancing patient-centered care. While currently retrospective studies with low generalizability and heterogeneity form the basis of ML TAVI research, future prospective investigations with highly heterogeneous patient TAVI cohorts will be critically important for firmly establishing the applicability of ML in predicting TAVI outcomes.","['Ruba Sulaiman', 'Md Ahasan Atick Faisal', 'Maram Hasan', 'Muhammad E H Chowdhury', 'Faycal Bensaali', 'Abdulrahman Alnabti', 'Huseyin C Yalcin']",International journal of medical informatics,2025-05-12,10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2025.105840,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2025.105840,,Paid,Machine learning for predicting outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve implantation A systematic review SULAIMAN 2025,Not available,"['transcatheter aortic valve', 'aortic valve implantation', 'TAVI outcomes', 'TAVI', 'transcatheter aortic', 'aortic valve', 'valve implantation', 'TAVI outcomes prediction', 'outcomes', 'aortic']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Aortic stenosis', 'Deep learning', 'Machine learning', 'Outcome prediction', 'TAVI', 'TAVR', 'Transcatheter aortic valve implantation']"
39924368,Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation in Patients at Intermediate and Low Risk Is Not (Yet) the Existential Threat That Surgeons Feared: A Retrospective Analysis of Medicare Claims Data.,"BACKGROUND: In Australia, the role of surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) and transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in patients who are suitable for both procedures remains controversial. In 2022, new Items were added to the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) to allow patients at intermediate and low risk with appropriate private health insurance to undergo TAVI. The Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand supported these changes whereas the Australian and New Zealand Society of Cardiac and Thoracic Surgeons opposed them. The aim of this study was to document subsequent private TAVI activity in patients at intermediate and low risk, relative to both private TAVI activity in patients at high risk and private SAVR activity.
METHOD: A retrospective population-level descriptive study was undertaken, using Medicare claims data obtained from Services Australia.
RESULTS: Among private patients who underwent TAVI, the groups at high, intermediate, and low risk all had a median age between 75 and 84 years. Only 1% were aged ≤64 years (86/6,586), and 80% of these were at high risk (69/86). Among private patients at intermediate and low risk who underwent TAVI and private patients who underwent SAVR, only 4% of patients aged 55-64 years chose private TAVI over private SAVR (8/211), and 63% of these were at intermediate risk (5/8).
CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of MBS Items for private TAVI in patients at intermediate and low risk without accompanying age exclusion criteria has not (yet) had a major impact on private SAVR activity.

39903642,The reversibility of cardiac damage after transcatheter aortic valve implantation and short-term outcomes in a real-world setting.,"AIMS: This study aims to assess the changes in cardiac damage stage in a real-world cohort of patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), and to investigate the prognostic value of cardiac damage stage evolution.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing TAVI were retrospectively analysed. A five-stage system based on the presence and extent of cardiac damage assessed by echocardiography was applied before and 6 months after TAVI. Multivariable Cox regression analyses were used to examine independent prognostic value of the changes in cardiac damage after TAVI. A total of 734 patients with severe AS (mean age, 79.8 ± 7.4 years; 55% male) were included. Before TAVI, 32 (4%) patients did not show any sign of extra-valvular cardiac damage (Stage 0), 85 (12%) had left ventricular damage (Stage 1), 220 (30%) left atrial and/or mitral valve damage (Stage 2), 227 (31%) pulmonary vasculature and/or tricuspid valve damage (Stage 3), and 170 (23%) right ventricular damage (Stage 4). Six months after TAVI, 39% of the patients improved at least one stage in cardiac damage. Staging of cardiac damage at 6 months after TAVI [hazard ratio (HR) per one-stage increase, 1.391; P = 0.035] as well as worsening in the stage of cardiac damage (HR, 3.729; P = 0.005) were independently associated with 2-year all-cause mortality.
CONCLUSION: More than one-third of patients with severe AS showed an improvement in cardiac damage 6 months after TAVI.

39894430,Paravalvular Leak After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation: Results From 3600 Patients.,"BACKGROUND: Paravalvular leak (PVL) after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is associated with poor outcomes. Mild PVL remains prevalent after TAVI, and its impact on long-term survival is unclear. This study aimed to examine the incidence, impact on survival, and progression of PVL.
METHODS: This was a retrospective, single-institution cohort study of TAVIs between November 2012 and January 2023. Patients were stratified by 30-day PVL severity: none to trace, mild, and moderate to severe. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify risk factors associated with increasing PVL severity. Kaplan-Meier survival estimation and Cox proportional hazards regression were performed.
RESULTS: A total of 3600 patients underwent TAVI. Of these, 2719 (75.5%) had none to trace PVL, 808 (22.5%) had mild PVL, and 73 (2.0%) had moderate to severe PVL at 30 days. On multivariable logistic regression, later years of valve implantation (2017-2023) were protective against PVL progression. Kaplan-Meier estimates of the 3 groups were significantly different (P < .001) with the moderate to severe group having reduced survival. On Cox regression, moderate to severe PVL was associated with increased mortality (hazard ratio, 1.80; 95% Cl, 1.31-2.46; P < .001), whereas mild PVL was not (hazard ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.89-1.15; P = .88) compared with none to trace PVL. For Kaplan-Meier estimates comparing the none to trace and mild PVL groups alone, landmark analysis showed reduced survival in the mild PVL group after 2 years (P = .03); however, this late reduction in survival in the mild PVL group did not persist on multivariable analysis (P = .14).
CONCLUSIONS: After TAVI, moderate to severe PVL is associated with reduced survival compared with none to trace PVL. Mild PVL may result in a delayed survival reduction.","['Nav Warraich', 'James A Brown', 'Eishan Ashwat', 'Dustin Kliner', 'Derek Serna-Gallegos', 'Catalin Toma', 'David West', 'Amber Makani', 'Yisi Wang', 'Ibrahim Sultan']",The Annals of thoracic surgery,2025-05-12,10.1016/j.athoracsur.2025.01.012,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.athoracsur.2025.01.012,,Paid,Paravalvular Leak After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation Results From 3600 Patients WARRAICH 2025,Not available,"['Transcatheter Aortic Valve', 'Aortic Valve Implantation', 'PVL', 'Mild PVL', 'Paravalvular Leak', 'Valve Implantation', 'Transcatheter Aortic', 'Aortic Valve', 'severe PVL', 'trace PVL']",2025-05-12,Pending,[]

38815806,Machine-learning approaches for risk prediction in transcatheter aortic valve implantation: Systematic review and meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVES: With the expanding integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) into the structural heart domain, numerous ML models have emerged for the prediction of adverse outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). We aim to identify, describe, and critically appraise ML prediction models for adverse outcomes after TAVI. Key objectives consisted in summarizing model performance, evaluating adherence to reporting guidelines, and transparency.
METHODS: We searched PubMed, SCOPUS, and Embase through August 2023. We selected published machine learning models predicting TAVI outcomes. Two reviewers independently screened articles, extracted data, and assessed the study quality according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Outcomes included summary C-statistics and model risk of bias assessed with the Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. C-statistics were pooled using a random-effects model.
RESULTS: Twenty-one studies (118,153 patients) employing various ML algorithms (76 models) were included in the systematic review. Predictive ability of models varied: 11.8% inadequate (C-statistic <0.60), 26.3% adequate (C-statistic 0.60-0.70), 31.6% acceptable (C-statistic 0.70-0.80), and 30.3% demonstrated excellent (C-statistic >0.80) performance. Meta-analyses revealed excellent predictive performance for early mortality (C-statistic: 0.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65-0.91), acceptable performance for 1-year mortality (C-statistic: 0.76; 95% CI, 0.67-0.84), and acceptable performance for predicting permanent pacemaker implantation (C-statistic: 0.75; 95% CI, 0.51-0.90).
CONCLUSIONS: ML models for TAVI outcomes exhibit adequate-to-excellent performance, suggesting potential clinical utility.

40340705,Evaluating the AltaValve as a novel method for transcatheter mitral valve replacement.,"Mitral regurgitation (MR) is the most common heart valve disease, and severe MR is associated with a poor prognosis if left untreated. Although surgical repair or replacement constitutes the standard therapy when indicated, many high-risk patients are considered ineligible for surgery. Transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR) offers a less invasive alternative to conventional surgery and may also overcome some of the limitations of percutaneous repair techniques. Currently, multiple TMVR devices are undergoing clinical evaluation, showing promising results. However, challenges mainly related to the complex mitral valve anatomy along with the interaction with the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) have resulted in high screen failure rates among TMVR candidates. The AltaValve System features a supra-annular design, ensuring secure fixation in the left atrium above the native mitral valve annulus without anchoring mechanisms that could interfere with the left ventricle (LV). These distinctive attributes aim to address the existing TMVR limitations across a broad patient population and help to avoid complications such as LVOT obstruction, LV damage, and/or prosthesis embolization. Initial safety and feasibility data are encouraging, but a larger cohort of patients with longer follow-up will be essential to confirm the safety and efficacy of the AltaValve system.","['Pablo Vidal-Calés', 'Pedro L Cepas-Guillén', 'Juan H Del Portillo', 'Josep Rodés-Cabau']",Future cardiology,2025-05-09,10.1080/14796678.2025.2499352,https://doi.org/10.1080/14796678.2025.2499352,,Paid,Evaluating the AltaValve as a novel method for transcatheter mitral valve replacement VIDAL-CALÉS 2025,Not available,"['mitral valve replacement', 'transcatheter mitral valve', 'mitral valve', 'valve replacement', 'transcatheter mitral', 'mitral', 'valve', 'TMVR', 'Evaluating the AltaValve', 'heart valve disease']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Mitral regurgitation', 'altavalve', 'mitral insufficiency', 'mitral valve', 'transcatheter mitral valve replacement']"

40240085,Surgical Mitral Valve Repair vs Replacement After Failed Mitral Transcatheter Edge-to-Edge Repair: The CUTTING-EDGE Registry.,"BACKGROUND: The impact of mitral valve (MV) surgery type after failed mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (M-TEER) has not been well studied.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of MV repair vs replacement after failed M-TEER.
METHODS: From 2009 to 2020, a total of 332 patients across 34 centers from the CUTTING-EDGE registry underwent MV surgery after M-TEER. Outcomes were compared between MV repair and replacement. Primary outcomes included 30-day mortality and 1-year survival after MV surgery.
RESULTS: Among enrolled patients (mean age 73.8 ± 10.1 years, median Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality 3.9% [Q1-Q3: 2.2%-6.8%]), 25 (7.5%) underwent repair and 307 (92.5%) underwent replacement. The replacement group had a significantly higher rate of comorbidities, including atrial fibrillation, prior cardiac surgery, more secondary mitral regurgitation, and more devices implanted at index M-TEER (P < 0.05 for all). Replacement patients showed a trend toward higher 30-day mortality (17.7% [52 of 294] vs 4.0% [1 of 25]; P = 0.094). The observed-to-expected ratio of 30-day mortality was 3.6 (95% CI: 1.9-5.3) overall, 3.8 (95% CI: 2.1-5.5) in the replacement group, and 1.7 (95% CI: 0.7-3.3) in the repair group. Replacement patients had higher 1-year mortality (33.3% [65 of 195] vs 10.5% [2 of 19]; P = 0.041). Significantly lower survival rates were observed after replacement at 2 years (P = 0.033) and persisted in the risk-adjusted Cox regression analysis (HR for replacement: 4.24; 95% CI: 1.04-17.31; P = 0.044).
CONCLUSIONS: MV surgery after failed M-TEER is a high-risk procedure associated with higher than expected 30-day mortality, with higher mortality associated with MV replacement. Compared with repair, replacement is associated with higher 1-year mortality and a lower 2-year survival.","['Mateo Marin-Cuartas', 'Jagdip Kang', 'Thilo Noack', 'Manuela de la Cuesta', 'Markus Krane', 'Volkmar Falk', 'Lenard Conradi', 'Christian Hagl', 'Maurizio Taramasso', 'Tom C Nguyen', 'D Scott Lim', 'Gorav Ailawadi', 'Michael J Mack', 'Robert L Smith', 'Anita W Asgar', 'Kendra J Grubb', 'Luigi Pirelli', 'Paolo Denti', 'Thomas Modine', 'Michael J Reardon', 'Tamim M Nazif', 'Vinayak N Bapat', 'Tsuyoshi Kaneko', 'Philipp Kiefer', 'Michael A Borger', 'Gilbert H L Tang', 'Syed Zaid']",JACC.

39904549,Valve thrombosis and antithrombotic therapy after bioprosthetic mitral valve replacement: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"AIMS: Transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR) has become a feasible alternative to surgical mitral valve replacement (SMVR) in selected patients at high surgical risk. The risk of valve thrombosis following SMVR and TMVR, and the optimal antithrombotic therapy following these procedures, remains uncertain. We aimed to compare the incidence of bioprosthetic mitral valve thrombosis (bMVT) after SMVR and TMVR, and the incidence of bMVT between patients on different antithrombotic regimens.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A literature search of Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library was performed between January 2000 and August 2024. Random-effects models were used to derive pooled estimates of the incidence of bMVT in the absence of prior or active endocarditis and valve thrombosis. A total of 47 studies (6170 patients, total follow-up 9541.8 patient-years) were eligible for inclusion. The overall incidence of bMVT was 5.05 [95% confidence interval (CI) 3.18-8.01, I2 = 82%] per 100-patient-years. Subclinical bMVT was more common than clinically significant bMVT: incidence 19.11 vs. 7.91 per 100-patient-years, adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) 4.62 (95% CI 1.39-15.36), P = 0.012. bMVT was numerically more common after TMVR than SMVR, but the comparison was not statistically significant: incidence 7.03 vs. 0.58 per 100-patient-years, aIRR 2.19 (95% CI 0.72-6.72), P = 0.170. Patients on vitamin-K antagonists (VKA) had a lower incidence of bMVT than patients on direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC; incidence 5.72 vs. 17.08, aIRR 0.31, 95% CI 0.13-0.73, P = 0.007).
CONCLUSIONS: bMVT is not uncommon, with numerically higher incidence in transcatheter compared to surgical valves, but the comparison was not statistically significant. VKAs are associated with a lower incidence of bMVT compared to DOACs.","['Mark J Zorman', 'Jonathan Vibhishanan', 'Katerina Dangas', 'James Castle', 'Ka Hou Christien Li', 'Marco Coronelli', 'Kate Eastwick-Jones', 'Alexander Swan', 'Nicky Johnson', 'Anurag Choksey', 'Helen Yan', 'Sam G C Scott', 'Matthew Henry', 'Mark Philip Cassar', 'Cara Barnes', 'Joao Ferreira-Martins', 'James Newton', 'Sam Dawkins', 'Mohamad Alkhouli', 'Charanjit Rihal', 'Mackram F Eleid', 'Sorin V Pislaru', 'Mayra E Guerrero', 'Jose Ordonez-Mena', 'Thomas J Cahill']",European heart journal.

40350498,Feasibility of Self-Expanding Transcatheter Pulmonary Valves in Patients with Pyramidal RVOT: Favorable Mid-term Outcomes.,"Transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement (TPVR) is effective for treating significant pulmonary regurgitation (PR), but mid-term data in patients with pyramidal right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) anatomy are limited. This multi-center retrospective study included patients who underwent TPVR between May 2014 and September 2023. Baseline and echocardiographic data were compared between patients with pyramidal and non-pyramidal RVOT. The primary endpoint was peri-procedural device success, defined as technical success, optimal valve function on discharge echocardiography (RVOT gradient < 30 mmHg, less than moderate PR, no significant paravalvular leak), and absence of in-hospital mortality or re-intervention. The secondary endpoint was 1-year freedom from all-cause mortality, cardiac hospitalization, endocarditis, significant stent fracture, valve dysfunction, and device-related re-intervention. Sixty-eight patients were enrolled. Device success was achieved in 86.7% of pyramidal RVOT patients and 100% of non-pyramidal patients (P = 0.067). At 1 year, no significant difference was observed in the composite secondary endpoint (91.7% vs. 86.0%, P = 0.605). Both groups showed similar improvements in echocardiographic and clinical outcomes. Additionally, no statistically significant differences were observed between the two groups regarding post-TPVR regurgitation and paravalvular leakage. TPVR using self-expanding valves in pyramidal RVOT showed acceptable device success rates and favorable mid-term outcomes in both clinical and hemodynamic parameters. Morphology-based pre-procedural planning is essential for optimizing results.","['Wenhao Zhu', 'Zhiyuan Xia', 'Jeffery Shi Kai Chan', 'Junyi Wan', 'Liang Xu', 'Yihang Li', 'Jingnan Zhang', 'Gary Tse', 'Fang Fang', 'Gejun Zhang']",Pediatric cardiology,2025-05-12,10.1007/s00246-025-03876-8,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00246-025-03876-8,PMC6398292,Free,Feasibility of Self Expanding Transcatheter Pulmonary Valves in Patients with Pyramidal RVOT Favorable Mid term Outcomes ZHU 2025,pdfs\Feasibility of Self Expanding Transcatheter Pulmonary Valves in Patients with Pyramidal RVOT Favorable Mid term Outcomes ZHU 2025.pdf,"['STROBE guidelines', 'study', 'observational study', 'STROBE', 'Transcatheter Pulmonary Valves', 'study design', 'observational', 'guidelines', 'pyramidal RVOT patients', 'Transcatheter Pulmonary']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['Computed tomography', 'Congenital heart disease', 'Transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement']"

METHODS: We included patients with repaired TOF with PS, atresia and absent pulmonary valve underwent TPVR (2007-2011) and followed at BCH until 2021. We compared their serial clinical, echo imaging as well as cardiopulmonary exercise test data among PS, PR and MIXED subgroups.
RESULTS: In 63 patients (20.8 years of age) the median early follow-up (FU) after TPVR was 6.2 months, and mid-term - 2.8 years. At baseline, the PR (n = 23) had lower LV EF, mass z-scores and global longitudinal strain (GLS) and the percent predicted peak O2 pulse than PS (n = 16) and those in the MIXED (n = 24) subgroups. BiV GLS improvement from baseline to early and to midterm FU occurred for all subgroups except for the LV GLS in the MIXED, which showed improvement from baseline to early follow-up. PR subgroup's LV GLS had gradual improvement, it remained lower than in PS and MIXED. No significant difference in exercise parameters were seen following TPVR. Freedom from reintervention at 10 years of FU was only 13.4 %.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PR had lower LV systolic function and exercise capacity than those with PS or MIXED prior TPVR with normalization of systolic function midterm in all thereafter.

The study aimed to explore the prevalence, heart function, valvular hemodynamics, and early outcomes of HALT after transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement (TPVR) METHODS: We studied 64 of 76 consecutive multicenter patients undergoing TPVR, with the implantation of Venus-P device. CT characteristics within a year, echocardiographic data, and early-term clinical endpoints were analyzed in patients with and without HALT.
RESULTS: CT scans revealed HALT in 28 patients (56%) and reduced leaflet motion (RLM) in 11 patients (20.8%) within one year [median interval 184 days (IQR: 104 to 214)]. HALT patients exhibited a lower percentage of normal tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion at the CT scan time (58.3% versus 73.7%; P = 0.020), although valvular hemodynamics and clinical endpoints were similar. Older age at intervention (OR: 1.05; 95% CI: 1.01-1.09) and larger body mass index (OR: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.01-1.36) were associated with HALT, while the use of anticoagulation was not identified as a protective factor. The HALT severity was positively correlated with the degree of leaflet motion (r = 0.67 and 0.69, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: HALT was highly prevalent, though it was subclinical. Early follow-up showed uneventful valvular hemodynamics and clinical outcomes.

The use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in pediatric patients with TPVRs is currently off-label without established data on safety and efficacy. The primary objective was a composite safety score consisting of clinically relevant non-major bleeding, major bleeding, bleeding-related re-admission, and medication discontinuation. The secondary objective consisted of the individual components of the composite score, in addition to valve thrombosis as represented by increasing transvalvular gradient by echocardiogram and valve complication requiring re-intervention. A single center, retrospective, descriptive study of pediatric patients who underwent TPVR placement. Patients were included in this study if they were less than 18 years old and received a DOAC in addition to low dose aspirin (standard of care) post procedure for thromboprophylaxis. Thirty-one patients were identified, of which 21 were males (68%) with a median age of 14 years (IQR: 13, 16) and median weight of 49 kg (IQR: 49, 60). Of the 31 patients, 4 (13%) met the composite outcome with all 4 patients having minor bleeding (13%), and one patient requiring hospital readmission for a minor bleed (3.2%). There were no major bleeds or bleeding-related deaths. No patients developed a valve thrombosis or valve complication requiring re-intervention. DOACs may be safe in pediatric patients after TPVR.

40289492,Hybrid Transcatheter Pulmonary Valve Replacement With SAPIEN S3 Following Right Ventricular Outflow Tract Reduction Using Tricuspid Annuloplasty Rings.,"We describe a novel variation of hybrid TPVR using a tricuspid annuloplasty ring which can be considered for patients with very large RVOT, short pulmonary artery, and limited vascular access and to avoid the risk of cardiopulmonary bypass. The utilization of Carpentier-Edwards Physio Tricuspid annuloplasty ring can reduce the size of the RVOT and at the same time the ring served as an effective docking site for the implantation of the SAPIEN S3 (Edwards Lifesciences). All three reported cases showed satisfactory immediate hemodynamic and clinical outcomes as well as at mid-term follow up.","['Mann Chandavimol', 'Piya Samankatiwat', 'Alisa Limsuwan', 'Tawai Ngernsritrakul', 'Jamil Aboulhosn']",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,2025-04-27,10.1002/ccd.31551,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.31551,,Paid,Hybrid Transcatheter Pulmonary Valve Replacement With SAPIEN S3 Following Right Ventricular Outflow Tract Reduction Using Tricuspid Annuloplasty Rings CHANDAVIMOL 2025,Not available,"['Ventricular Outflow Tract', 'Outflow Tract Reduction', 'Transcatheter Pulmonary Valve', 'Pulmonary Valve Replacement', 'tricuspid annuloplasty ring', 'Hybrid Transcatheter Pulmonary', 'Valve Replacement', 'Ventricular Outflow', 'Outflow Tract', 'Tract Reduction']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['congenital heart disease', 'pulmonic valve intervention', 'transcatheter heart valve intervention']"
40045877,Image-Derived Modeling to Assess Coronary Proximity in Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Pulmonary Valve Replacement With Self-Expanding Valves.,"BACKGROUND: The potential for coronary artery compression (CC) during transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement (TPVR) using self-expanding valves (SEV) is not fully understood, yet anecdotal reports suggest that this risk exists.
AIMS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients evaluated for SEV-TPVR to evaluate the relationship between the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) and coronary arteries (CA). CT-derived segmentations of the RVOT and CA were created using machine learning. A 2D map of the distance between the RVOT surface and CA, in systole and diastole, was created. In the subset of patients with post-procedural CTA, the distance before and after TPVR was measured.
RESULTS: Forty-two individuals underwent screening for SEV-TPVR, of which 83% (n = 35) had SEV implanted (Harmony = 24; Alterra = 11). Median age was 22.9 years (range 12-60) and 76% had tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). There was no significant change in the distance between the RVOT and LCA between diastole and systole (p = 0.31), yet the RVOT area nearest to the LCA displaced proximally by 11 mm (IQR: 5.6-19.9) in systole. In 8 patients with pre- and post-TPVR CTA, no statistically significant differences were observed in the RVOT-to-LCA relation after intervention. The distance to the LCA was smaller in pulmonary stenosis/atresia patients than those with TOF (median distance 1.2 and 2.1 mm, respectively; p = 0.185).
CONCLUSION: The RVOT area in closest proximity to LCA is dynamic and should be considered when planning TPVR. Special attention should be given to patients with a diagnosis of pulmonary stenosis/atresia.","['Yuval Barak-Corren', 'Vladislav Obsekov', 'Mudit Gupta', 'Christian Herz', 'Silvani Amin', 'Andras Lasso', ""Michael L O'Byrne"", 'Matthew J Gillespie', 'Matthew A Jolley']",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,2025-05-12,10.1002/ccd.31469,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.31469,PMC12058398,Paid,Image Derived Modeling to Assess Coronary Proximity in Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Pulmonary Valve Replacement With Self Expanding Valves BARAK-CORREN 2025,Not downloaded,"['Transcatheter Pulmonary Valve', 'Pulmonary Valve Replacement', 'Undergoing Transcatheter Pulmonary', 'Patients Undergoing Transcatheter', 'Modeling to Assess', 'Assess Coronary Proximity', 'Valve Replacement', 'Undergoing Transcatheter', 'Image-Derived Modeling', 'Self-Expanding Valves']",2025-05-12,Pending,"['3D modeling', 'coronary artery compression (CC)', 'machine learning', 'self‐expanding valves (SEV)', 'transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement (TPVR)']"
40308273,Transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement: will it prevail?,"Severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is a prevalent and challenging condition associated with poor survival outcomes and significant morbidity. Medical therapy alone often fails to provide adequate symptom relief, and stand-alone surgical intervention is linked to high mortality rates, making it a less favorable option unless combined with left-sided valve surgery. The advent of transcatheter tricuspid interventions has provided new therapeutic possibilities, particularly for high-risk patients who are ineligible for conventional surgery. However, many patients are still unsuited for transcatheter tricuspid repair or have only limited benefits from such procedures. In this context, Transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement (TTVR) has rapidly emerged as a promising alternative, offering the potential for more effective treatment outcomes. This review explores the latest advancements in TTVR devices, highlights key clinical findings, and discusses the challenges and limitations of this evolving strategy. Additionally, we address patient selection criteria, procedural outcomes, and future directions in the field, emphasizing the potential of TTVR to transform the management of severe TR.","['Xiling Zhang', 'Nina Sophie Pommert', 'David Meier', 'Stephanie L Sellers', 'Hatim Seoudy', 'Oliver J Müller', 'Derk Frank', 'Tim Attmann', 'Rouven Berndt', 'Gregor Warnecke', 'Thomas Puehler', 'Georg Lutter']",Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine,2025-05-12,10.3389/fcvm.2025.1562658,https://doi.org/10.3389/fcvm.2025.1562658,PMC12040945,Free,Transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement will it prevail?

40254997,[Feasibility study of transjugular tricuspid valve replacement for the treatment of tricuspid regurgitation].,"Objective: To evaluate the feasibility of transjugular transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement (TTVR) using the LuX-Valve Plus system (Ningbo Jenscare Scientific, China) for the treatment of severe tricuspid regurgitation in real-world clinical settings. Methods: This prospective study enrolled 81 patients with severe ricuspid regurgitation (≥3+) who underwent TTVR with the LuX-Valve Plus system at the Department of Cardiology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University between May 2022 and March 2024. Among them, 44 patients were from a compassionate-use study, and 37 were from two premarket clinical trials. Baseline clinical data, preprocedural imaging, procedural outcomes, and postprocedural follow-up data were collected. The primary endpoint events included device success, procedural success, and 30 d composite adverse events. Results: The age of the cohort was (74.5±7.8) years, with 54 females (67%). Device success and procedural success rates were both 90% (73/81). Post-procedural tricuspid regurgitation improved, with a 6% (5/81) incidence of moderate-to-severe paravalvular leakage. The rate of permanent pacemaker implantation was 12% (10/81), of which 5% (4/81) had pre-existing indications for pacemaker implantation. Major bleeding events occurred in 10% (8/81) of patients, and the 30 d composite endpoint rate was 25% (20/81). Conclusion: TTVR using the LuX-Valve Plus system demonstrates promising feasibility for high-risk surgical patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation, effectively reducing or eliminating regurgitation with acceptable safety. However, challenges remain in reducing risks of major adverse events, including permanent pacemaker implantation and severe bleeding.

40330572,Electrosurgical-laceration and stabilization of two PASCAL devices using artificial intelligence-based procedural planning: a case report.,"BACKGROUND: Mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (M-TEER) has been established as a treatment for severe mitral regurgitation (MR). However, recurrent MR may occur after successful primary M-TEER. Repeat M-TEER procedures are challenging or even anatomically unfeasible. Therefore, novel techniques like electrosurgical laceration from the anterior leaflet and stabilization (ELASTA) of M-TEER devices are important.
CASE SUMMARY: An 85-year-old male presented with recurrent cardiac decompensations and relevant dyspnoea [New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional Class III-IV] caused by severe MR and heart failure. Four years earlier, the patient underwent M-TEER with two PASCAL devices due to severe primary MR. Echocardiography revealed two significant regurgitation jets, representing severe recurrent MR. Repeated M-TEER was prohibitive due to an elevated mean transvalvular gradient (6.2 mmHg) and surgery was deemed unfeasible. A computed tomography (CT) was performed using software based on artificial intelligence (AI) for automatic analysis of the mitral valve anatomy. The heart team then decided to perform an ELASTA of the two PASCAL devices with subsequent transapical transcatheter mitral valve implantation (TMVI). The procedure was performed without complications and achieved optimal haemodynamic outcomes.
DISCUSSION: The frequency of M-TEER procedures will rise, leading to a corresponding increase of recurrent MR requiring treatment. However, additional edge-to-edge repair is often not feasible due to space limitations, elevated inflow gradients, or progressive calcification of valve leaflets. Emerging electrosurgical techniques, such as ELASTA, combined with subsequent TMVI, offer promising solutions for recurrent MR. Computed tomography imaging plays a critical role in procedural planning, and AI-driven programs have the potential to significantly improve and optimize these analyses.","['Stephan Nienaber', 'Jonathan Curio', 'Elmar W Kuhn', 'Hendrik Wienemann', 'Matti Adam']",European heart journal.
